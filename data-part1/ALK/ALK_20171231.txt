PART I ITEM 1 OUR BUSINESS Air Group operates three airlines Alaska Virgin America and Horizon McGee Air Services an aviation services provider is a whollyowned subsidiary of Alaska Together with regional partner airlines we fly to 118 destinations with 1200 daily departures through an expansive network across the United States Mexico Canada and Costa Rica With global airline partners we provide our guests with a network of more than 900 destinations worldwide During 2017  we carried an alltime high 44 million guests and earned consolidated net income of 10 billion  which represents a 27 increase over net income of 814 million in 2016  Our adjusted net income was 823 million  which excludes special items and mergerrelated costs of  118 million  and a 280 million benefit from new tax laws enacted in 2017 Our mission is creating an airline people love The ing is to recognize that we are never done we are continually working to improve We believe our success depends on our ability to provide safe air transportation develop relationships with guests by providing exceptional customer service and low fares and maintain a low cost structure to compete effectively It is important to us that we achieve our objective as a socially responsible company that values not just performance but people the communities we serve and environment In 2017 we focused much of our energy on integrating Virgin America We achieved several milestones including merging most back office functions kicking off station colocations and launching technology that enables our frontline employees to be agile between Alaska and Virgin America applications In January 2018 Alaska and Virgin America obtained a single operating certificate from the Federal Aviation Administration FAA our most significant integration milestone to date These accomplishments will ease our transition to a single Passenger Service System PSS in the Spring of 2018 which will help us unlock many of the revenue synergies expected from the acquisition We remain on track to complete all of our integration milestones on schedule and continue to be optimistic about the value of our combined company With the integration well underway we remain committed to our strategic focus to become the goto airline for people on the West Coast The acquisition of Virgin America positioned us as the fifth largest airline in the US with an unparalleled ability to serve West Coast travelers To do so we believe we need to meet our guests evolving needs through innovation in our onboard offerings and provide unique destinations with better schedules while retaining the best of both the Alaska and Virgin America brand experiences We have begun to implement this strategy in a number of ways including merging our loyalty programs allowing us to bring the award winning benefits of our Mileage Plan program to Virgin Americas loyal customer base rolling out Free Movies and Free Chat to Virgin Americas entire fleet and kicking off the first of several cabin enhancements of Alaskas Boeing aircraft with expressive mood lighting While aircraft and technology enable us to provide air transportation we recognize this is fundamentally a people business Our employees maintain and strengthen our relationships with guests and our success depends on our employees working together to successfully execute our strategy In 2017  Alaska was once again named one of Americas Best Employers by Forbes Magazine for the third year in a row We know that engaged employees provide excellent service In that vein in 2017  Alaska ranked highest in JD Power and Associates annual survey of customer satisfaction among traditional network carriers for the tenth year in a row Virgin America was also recognized for excellent service by Conde Nast Traveler and Travel  Leisure magazine also for the tenth year in a row Customer service matters and we believe the combination of Alaska and Virgin America will only enhance the experience for our guests Operationally Alaska held the No 1 spot in the Wall Street Journals Middle Seat scorecard for US airlines for four consecutive years and the No 2 spot for 2017 Although we were not the leader in ontime performance in 2017 we led the industry for ontime performance among major airlines for the previous seven years We are focused on becoming the industry leader in operational performance once again as we fully integrate Alaska and Virgin America operations and we are off to a great start in 2018 For achieving safety customer service operational and financial goals we rewarded our employees with 135 million for their service in 2017  In support of the communities that we serve we strive to be an industry leader in environmental and community stewardship Our combined fleet is one of the youngest most fuelefficient fleets in North America and we look forward to further enhancements in this area As a result of our environmental and corporate sustainability leadership we ranked higher than any other North American airline in this years Dow Jones Sustainability Index We are also proud of our community stewardship  Air Group donated 14 million to over 1300 charitable organizations and our employees volunteered more than 32000 hours of community service focused on youth and education medical research and transportation and community outreach in 2017  4 One of our leadership principles is to give back and we are proud of the efforts and voluntarism of our employees across the system We continued to generate strong profits in 2017  marking our 14th consecutive annual profit on an adjusted basis Our liquidity and capital position remain strong positioning us among those of highquality industrial companies Due to our strong financial health and outlook we are one of only three US airlines with investment grade credit ratings With the cash generated by our continued success we have been able to invest in our business to achieve profitable growth and to enhance the guest experience As we look to the future we will build on our success by executing our strategic plan in the following areas Be Safe and On time We have an unwavering commitment to run a safe operation and we will not compromise this commitment in the pursuit of other initiatives Alaska and Horizon were the first US major airlines to receive FAA validation and acceptance of our Safety Management System SMS in 2016 In 2017 Virgin America adopted SMS ensuring a consistent safety process across our carriers Additionally all Virgin America employees received training for the Alaska Air Group SMS our Ready Safe Go principles and our mobile safety reporting system Once again in 2017 100 of our Alaska and Horizon aircraft technicians completed the requirements for the FAAs Diamond Certificate of Excellence award This is the 16th consecutive year Alaska Airlines has received the award and the 16th time in the last 18 years Horizon has received this award We also believe that maintaining safe operations through adherence to welldefined processes and ensuring every Air Group employee is aware of their individual contribution to our operation is critical to ensuring ontime performance The rigor we apply to running a safe operation has resulted in Alaska consistently being one of the top airlines in North America for ontime performance Focus on People Our business is fundamentally a people business and our success depends on our nearly 23000 employees Engaged employees deliver higher productivity superior execution and better customer service In merging Alaska Airlines and Virgin America employees and labor groups we kept a vigilant focus on creating an unbeatable culture In January 2017 we rolled out Momentum training for all Virgin America employees to help bridge the two airlines and blend our cultures We implemented Culture Champion initiatives to help employees build relationships across airlines allowing them to share concerns and feedback directly with executive leadership Similarly our QX Factor program brought new energy to the Horizon employee experience Our people programs and integration plan are focused on ensuring employees feel valued informed and engaged in meaningful ways as we build our future Aligning our employees goals with Air Groups goals is important in achieving success All permanent employees of our airlines participate in our PerformanceBased Pay PBP and Operational Performance Rewards OPR programs which encourage employees to work together to achieve metrics related to safety profitability ontime performance low costs customer loyalty and customer satisfaction Over the last five years our incentive programs have paid out on average more than one months pay for most employees Build a deep emotional connection for our brand To be the goto airline for people on the West Coast we must be recognized for creating an airline that people love In 2017 we built upon the strong brand connection we have with our guests in our Pacific Northwest markets and the state of Alaska by broadening our focus to include California We rolled out fresh modern marketing campaigns showcasing benefits such as our network growth low fares our Buy One Get One companion fare credit card promotional offer and unique onboard experience elements We are enthusiastic about our plans for continued investment in key products that will provide meaningful improvements to our guests such as Gogo satellite internet which we will begin installing in early 2018 Additionally we partnered with key sponsors in the Bay Area including sports franchises such as the San Francisco Giants and the San Jose Sharks as well as noted professional athletes including Kevin Durant of the Golden State Warriors We continue to invest in key products that will provide meaningful improvements to our guests and further drive an emotional connection to our brand This includes Free Chat and Free Movies and the launch of Gogo satellite service already mentioned above Weve rolled out new digital products to improve the guest experience including a new inflight entertainment portal and the beta launch of First Class meal preselect Weve nearly completed retrofits of our Boeing fleet to include Premium Class while adding larger overhead bins to many of our aircraft Expanding our airport lounge portfolio weve opened a third lounge at SeaTac airport and plan to open a lounge at JFK in 2018 Finally guests can also look forward to an integrated onboard food and beverage program in 2018 which will emphasize fresh and local West Coast products on our aircraft 5 Defend and grow our customer base Competition in our markets is fierce and we know we must defend our customer base as we grow our network presence by providing our guests with an increased choice of schedule times and fares and allowing us to effectively compete for new guests We will continue to introduce guests to our awardwinning service Mileage Plan program and Visa signature credit card as we grow our network We work hard to ensure our guests have a great experience on our airlines and provide an exceptional product at a low fare Win with low costs and low fares We believe that our lowfare model gives us a competitive advantage by providing value to and building trust with our guests We also know that in order to provide low fares in our growing network while returning value to our shareholders it is imperative for us to maintain a competitive cost structure In 2017  our unit costs excluding fuel and special items remained flat year over year on a consolidated basis We understand the importance of low costs to the business model and the success of the company and we have a long track record of reducing unit costs Although our unit costs are expected to rise in 2018 primarily due to pilot wages and maintenance costs we continue to focus on productivity cost management low overhead and leveraging capacity growth We also manage increasing fuel costs by flying larger more fuelefficient aircraft which have increased our fuel efficiency as measured by available seat miles flown per gallon by 35 over the last five years As we continue to integrate Virgin America into our operations we are committed to achieving our stated cost and revenue synergy goals It is critical that we achieve these goals in order to continue our cost reduction efforts During fiscal 2017  we added 44 new markets to the combined network For 2018  we plan to grow our systemwide capacity approximately 75 as compared to 2017  Approximately 70 of growth in 2018 is attributable to existing routes and locations with the rest attributable to our plans to fly 13 daily departures from Paine FieldSnohomish County Airport in Everett Washington to eight West Coast markets starting in fall 2018 AIR GROUP Alaska Air Group is a Delaware corporation incorporated in 1985 and the holding company of Alaska Virgin America Horizon McGee Air Services a whollyowned subsidiary of Alaska and other business units Alaska Virgin America and Horizon operate as airlines

maintained two frequent flyer plans the Alaska Airlines Mileage Plan and Virgin America Elevate To provide consistency and clarity to our guests we merged the two programs throughout the year and Elevate was officially sunset in December 2017 Alaska Airlines Mileage Plan provides a comprehensive suite of frequent flyer benefits Miles can be earned by flying on our airlines or on one of our 18 airline partners by using the Alaska Airlines credit card or through other nonairline partners Alaskas extensive list of airline partners includes carriers associated with each of the three major global alliances making it easier for our members to earn miles and reach elite status in our frequent flyer program Through Alaska and our global partners Mileage Plan members have access to a large network of over 900 worldwide travel destinations Further members can receive 30000 bonus miles upon signing up for the Alaska Airlines Visa Signature card and meeting a minimum spend threshold and earn triple miles on Alaska Airlines and Virgin America purchases Alaska Airlines Visa Signature cardholders and small business cardholders in the US and Platinum and World Elite Mastercard holders in Canada also receive an annual companion ticket that allows members to purchase an additional ticket for 99 plus taxes with no restrictions or blackout dates and a free first checked bag for up to seven people traveling in the same itinerary Earned miles can be redeemed for flights on our airlines or partner airlines or for upgrades to First Class on Alaska Airlines We believe all of these benefits give our Mileage Plan members more value for their travel Mileage Plan and Elevate revenues represented approximately 11 of Air Groups total revenues in 2017  Mileage Plan helps drive revenue growth by attracting new customers and building customer loyalty through the benefits that we provide AGREEMENTS WITH OTHER AIRLINES Our agreements fall into three different categories Frequent Flyer Codeshare and Interline agreements Frequent Flyer agreements offer mileage credits and redemptions for our Mileage Plan members Alaska offers one of the most comprehensive frequent flyer programs for our Mileage Plan members through frequent flyer partnerships with 18 domestic and international carriers Codeshare agreements allow one or more marketing carriers to sell seats on a single operating carrier that services passengers under multiple flight numbers The sale of codeshare seats can vary depending on the sale arrangement For example in a freesale arrangement the marketing carrier sells the operating carriers inventory without any restriction whereas in a block space arrangement a fixed amount of seats are sold to the marketing carrier by the operating carrier The interchangeability of the flight code between carriers provides a greater selection of flights for customers along with increased flexibility for mileage accrual and redemption Interline agreements allow airlines to jointly offer a competitive singlefare itinerary to customers traveling via multiple carriers to a final destination An interline itinerary offered by one airline may not necessarily be offered by the other and the fares collected from passengers are prorated and distributed to interline partners according to preexisting agreements between the carriers Frequent flyer codeshare and interline agreements help increase our traffic and revenue by providing more route choices to our guests Alaska has marketing alliances with a number of airlines that provide frequent flyer and codesharing opportunities Alliances are an important part of our strategy and enhance our revenues by 8  offering our guests more travel destinations and better mileage creditredemption opportunities including elite qualifying miles on US and international airline partners  giving our frequent flyer program a competitive advantage because of our partnership with carriers from all three of the major global alliances  giving us access to more connecting traffic from other airlines and  providing members of our alliance partners frequent flyer programs an opportunity to travel on Alaska Virgin America and our regional partners while earning mileage credit in our partners programs Most of our codeshare relationships are freesale codeshares where the marketing carrier sells seats on the operating carriers flights from the operating carriers inventory but takes no inventory risk Our marketing agreements have various termination dates and one or more may be in the process of renegotiation at any time The comprehensive summary of Alaskas alliances with other airlines is as follows Codeshare Frequent Flyer Agreement Alaska Flight  on Flights Operated by Other Airline Other Airline Flight  on

December 31 2016 OTHER REVENUE Other revenue consists of freight and mail certain frequent flyer and ancillary revenue While some of our product features are included in our base pricing we have unbundled certain ancillary features that our guests separately value Major ancillary revenue products include checked bag fees change fees and lounge memberships We also promote and sell products inflight to enhance the guest experience including our Tom Douglas signature meals snacks alcoholic beverages inflight entertainment and WiFi Total other revenue excluding frequent flyer program revenue represents about 7 of our total revenues GENERAL The airline industry is highly competitive and subject to various uncertainties including economic conditions volatile fuel prices industry instability new competition a largely unionized work force the need to finance large capital expenditures and the related availability of capital government regulationincluding taxes and fees and potential aircraft incidents Airlines have high fixed costs primarily for wages aircraft fuel aircraft ownership and facilities rents Because expenses of a flight do not vary significantly based on the number of passengers carried a relatively small change in the number of passengers or in pricing has a disproportionate effect on an airlines operating and financial results In other words a minor shortfall in expected revenue levels could cause a disproportionately negative impact on our operating and financial results Passenger demand and ticket prices are in large measure influenced by the general state of the economy current global economic and political events and total available airline seat capacity In 2017  the airline industrys profits declined when compared to the record setting year of 2016 primarily due to rising fuel prices higher labor costs and increased competitive fare actions reducing ticket prices Despite some of these headwinds the industry continued to report strong profits in 2017 In the current strong industry environment airlines are making significant investments in airports in more fuelefficient planes and in new services to differentiate their customer service offering Thus the level of competition is expected to continue to increase FUEL Our business and financial results are highly affected by the price and the availability of aircraft fuel The cost of aircraft fuel is volatile and outside of our control and it can have a significant and immediate impact on our operating results Over the past five years aircraft fuel expense ranged from 18 to 34 of operating expenses Fuel prices are impacted by changes in both the price of crude oil and refining margins and can vary by region in the US The prices we have paid for crude oil on an average annual basis for the past five years have ranged from a low of 43 per barrel in 2016 to a high of 98 in 2013 For us a 1 per barrel change in the price of oil equates to approximately 19 million of fuel cost annually Said another way a onecent change in our fuel price per gallon will impact our expected annual fuel cost by approximately 8 million per year Refining margins which represent the price of refining crude oil into aircraft fuel are a smaller portion of the overall price of jet fuel but also contributed to the price volatility in recent years Average annual West Coast refining margin prices have fluctuated between 13 per barrel and 36 per barrel in the last five years and averaged 18 per barrel in 2017  10 Generally West Coast jet fuel prices are somewhat higher and more volatile than prices in the Gulf Coast or on the East Coast Our average raw fuel cost per gallon increased 21 in 2017  after decreasing 19 in 2016 and 39 in 2015  The percentages of our aircraft fuel expense by crude oil and refining margins as well as the percentage of our aircraft fuel expense of operating expenses are as follows 2017 2016 a 2015 2014 2013 Crude oil 66  69  62

period December 14 2016 through December 31 2016 b Other includes gains and losses on settled fuel hedges unrealized marktomarket fuel hedge gains or losses taxes and other intoplane costs We use crude oil call options as hedges to decrease our exposure to the volatility of jet fuel prices Call options effectively cap our pricing for crude oil limiting our exposure to increasing fuel prices for about half of our planned fuel consumption With call options we are hedged against spikes in crude oil prices and during a period of decline in crude oil prices we only forfeit cash previously paid for hedge premiums We begin hedging approximately 18 months in advance of crude oil consumption We believe that operating fuelefficient aircraft is the best hedge against high fuel prices Alaska operates an allBoeing 737 fleet Virgin America operates an allAirbus A320 family fleet and Horizon currently operates a fleet including Embraer 175 jet aircraft and Bombardier Q400 turboprop aircraft Air Groups fuelefficiency rate expressed in available seat miles flown per gallon ASMsg improved from 753 ASMsg in 2013 to 779 ASMsg in 2017  These improvements have not only reduced our fuel consumption rate but also the amount of greenhouse gases and other pollutants that our aircraft emit COMPETITION Competition in the airline industry is intense and unpredictable Our competitors consist primarily of other airlines and to a lesser extent other forms of transportation Competition can be direct in the form of another carrier flying the exact nonstop route or indirect where a carrier serves the same two cities nonstop from an alternative airport in that city or via an itinerary requiring a connection at another airport We compete with other domestic airlines and a limited number of international airlines on nearly all of our scheduled routes Our largest competitor is Delta who has significantly increased its capacity in Seattle over the past few years Approximately 75 of our capacity to and from Seattle competes with Delta As we grow in California and expand our transcontinental route offerings United Airlines and Southwest Airlines have also become large competitors and have increased their capacity in markets we serve Our California and transcontinental routes have a higher concentration of competitors when compared to our historical route structure which was predominately concentrated in the Pacific Northwest Based on schedules filed with the US Department of Transportation we expect the amount of competitive capacity overlap with all carriers to increase by more than 6 in the first half of 2018  weighted based on our network We believe that the following principal competitive factors are important to our guests  Safety record Safety is our top priority and is at the core of everything we do In 2017 we were ranked by AirlineRatingscom as one of only two US airlines in the Top 20 safest airlines in the world We also received our 16th Diamond Award of Excellence from the Federal Aviation Administration recognizing both Alaska and Horizon aircraft technicians for their commitment to training  Customer service and reputation We compete with other airlines in areas of customer service such as ontime performance guest amenitiesincluding first class and other premium seating quality of onboard products aircraft type and comfort In 2017  Alaska Airlines ranked highest in customer satisfaction among traditional network carriers by JD Power and Associates for the tenth year in a row We have installed Boeing Space Bins on the majority of our Boeing 737900ER fleet providing additional overhead bin space for our guests In 2017 we launched a Premium Class of service on our B737 aircraft that provides extra 11 legroom early boarding premium snacks and a complimentary alcoholic beverage Additionally in 2017 we increased the distance between seats in our first class cabins on the Alaska B737900 and B737900ER fleet providing significantly more space for guests flying in the First Class cabin We expect to fully complete the First Class cabin upgrades on the B737900 and B737900ER fleet in early 2018 Starting in 2018 we will begin reconfiguring the interior and livery of the Airbus fleet The new livery and interior reconfiguration will provide guests a consistent brand experience across the Mainline fleet The projects are expected to be complete in late 2019 Our employees are a key element of our product We have a highly engaged workforce that strives to provide a high degree of service and hospitality to our guests both at the airport and in flight We heavily emphasize our service standards with our employees through training and education programs and monetary incentives related to operational performance and guest surveys  Fares and ancillary services Fare pricing is a significant competitive factor in the airline industry and the increased availability of fare information on the Internet allows travelers to easily compare fares and identify competitor promotions and discounts Pricing is driven by a variety of factors including but not limited to marketspecific capacity market share per routegeographic area cost structure fare vs ancillary revenue strategies and demand For example airlines often discount fares to drive traffic in new markets or to stimulate traffic when necessary to improve load factors In addition traditional network carriers have been able to reduce their operating costs through bankruptcies and mergers while lowcost carriers have continued to grow their fleets and expand their networks potentially enabling them to better control costs per available seat mile the average cost to fly an aircraft seat one mile which in turn may enable them to lower their fares These factors can reduce our pricing power and that of the airline industry as a whole Domestic airline capacity is dominated by four large carriers representing over 80 of total seats Accordingly if these carriers discount their fares or enter into our core markets we must match those fares in order to maintain our load factors often resulting in yearoveryear decreases in our yields We will defend our core markets and if necessary redeploy capacity to better match supply with demand We believe the restructuring weve completed over the past decade has decreased our costs enabling us to offer competitive fares while still earning returns for our shareholders  Routes served flight schedules codesharing and interline relationships and frequent flyer programs We also compete with other airlines based on markets served the frequency of service to those markets and frequent flyer opportunities Some airlines have more extensive route structures than we do and they offer significantly more international routes In order to expand opportunities for our guests we enter into codesharing and interline relationships with other airlines that provide reciprocal frequent flyer mileage credit and redemption privileges These relationships allow us to offer our guests access to more destinations than we can on our own gain exposure in markets we dont serve and allow our guests more opportunities to earn and redeem frequent flyer miles The Mileage Plan offers some of the most comprehensive benefits to our members with the ability to earn and redeem miles on 18 partner carriers In addition to domestic or foreign airlines that we compete with on most of our routes we compete with ground transportation in our shorthaul markets To some extent our airlines also compete with technology such as video conferencing and internetbased meeting tools that have changed the need for or frequency of facetoface business meetings TICKET DISTRIBUTION Our tickets are distributed through three primary channels  Direct to customer It is less expensive for us to sell through our direct channels at alaskaaircom and virginamericacom As a result we continue to take steps to drive more business to our websites In addition we believe these channels are preferable from a branding and customerrelationship standpoint in that we can establish ongoing communication with the customer and tailor offers accordingly  Traditional and online travel agencies Both traditional and online travel agencies typically use Global Distribution Systems GDS to obtain their fare and inventory data from airlines Bookings made through these agencies result in a fee 12 that is charged to the airline Many of our large corporate customers require us to use these agencies Some of our competitors do not use this distribution channel and as a result have lower ticket distribution costs  Reservation call centers Our call centers are located in Phoenix AZ Kent WA and Boise ID We generally charge a 15 fee for booking reservations through the call centers Our sales by channel are as follows 2017 2016 a 2015 2014 2013 Direct to customer 62  61  60  57  55  Traditional agencies 22  23  23  25  27

31 2016 SEASONALITY AND OTHER FACTORS Our results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of those for the entire year because our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations Our profitability is generally lowest during the first and fourth quarters due principally to fewer departures and passengers Profitability typically increases in the second quarter and then reaches its highest level during the third quarter as a result of vacation travel including increased activity in the state of Alaska However we have significantly improved the seasonality of our operations by our continued growth from the West Coast to leisure destinations like Hawaii and Costa Rica and expansion to leisure and business destinations in the midcontinental and eastern US In addition to passenger loads factors that could cause our quarterly operating results to vary include  pricing initiatives by us or our competitors  changes in fuel costs  increases in competition at our primary airports  general economic conditions and resulting changes in passenger demand and  increases or decreases in passenger and volumedriven variable costs Many of the markets we serve experience inclement weather conditions in the winter causing increased costs associated with deicing aircraft canceling flights and accommodating displaced passengers Due to our geographic area of operations we can be more susceptible to adverse weather conditions particularly in the state of Alaska and the Pacific Northwest than some of our competitors who may be better able to spread weatherrelated risks over larger route systems We also are susceptible to Air Traffic Control due to our heavy concentration of departures from Seattle and San Francisco No material part of our business or that of our subsidiaries is dependent upon a single customer or upon a few highvolume customers EMPLOYEES Our business is labor intensive As of December 31 2017  we employed 23156  13896 at Alaska 3538 at Virgin America 3943 at Horizon and 1779 at McGee Air Services active fulltime and parttime employees Wages and benefits including variable incentive pay represented approximately 39 of our total nonfuel operating expenses in 2017 and 40 in 2016  Most major airlines including Alaska Virgin America and Horizon have employee groups that are covered by collective bargaining agreements CBA Airlines with unionized work forces generally have higher labor costs than carriers without unionized work forces and they may not have the ability to adjust labor costs downward quickly enough to respond to new competition or slowing demand 13 As part of the integration we have been working to bring represented Alaska Airlines and Virgin America work groups under single collective bargaining agreements The process for combining workgroups begins with the union filing a petition with the National Mediation Board NMB at which point the NMB performs a review to assess a single carrier determination for the airlines Following this single carrier determination the NMB makes a representation determination depending on size of the premerger bargaining units and will either extend the certification if one is significantly larger than the other or require a vote Once representation is determined the NMB certifies the union as the bargaining representative for the work group The parties must also work together to achieve agreed upon single collective bargaining agreements Integration also requires the premerger work groups to agree upon and finalize integrated seniority lists As of December 31 2017 we have labor integration agreements with pilots and clerical office and passenger services employees meaning all agreements are completed to define how and when we will combine the Alaska and Virgin America groups into one The remaining work groups are still in process of completing similar such agreements The time frame to reach single CBA and full transition to work rules for each group will vary At December 31 2017  labor unions represented 84 of Alaskas 84 of Virgin Americas 44 of Horizons and 90 of McGee Air Services employees Our relations with US labor organizations are governed by the Railway Labor Act RLA Under the RLA collective bargaining agreements do not expire but instead become amendable as of a stated date If either party wishes to modify the terms of any such agreement it must notify the other party in the manner prescribed by the RLA andor described in the agreement After receipt of such notice the parties must meet for direct negotiations and if no agreement is reached either party may request the NMB to initiate a process including mediation arbitration and a potential cooling off period that must be followed before either party may engage in selfhelp 14 Alaskas union contracts at December 31 2017 were as follows Union Employee Group Number of Employees Contract Status Air Line Pilots Association

by the federal government The Department of Transportation DOT the Federal Aviation Administration FAA and the Transportation Security Administration TSA exercise significant regulatory authority over air carriers 17  DOT In order to provide passenger and cargo air transportation in the US a domestic airline is required to hold a certificate of public convenience and necessity issued by the DOT Subject to certain individual airport capacity noise and other restrictions this certificate permits an air carrier to operate between any two points in the US Certificates do not expire but may be revoked for failure to comply with federal aviation statutes regulations orders or the terms of the certificates While airlines are permitted to establish their own fares without government regulation the DOT has jurisdiction over the approval of international codeshare agreements marketing alliance agreements between major domestic carriers international and some domestic route authorities Essential Air Service market subsidies carrier liability for personal or property damage and certain airport rates and charges disputes International treaties may also contain restrictions or requirements for flying outside of the US and impose different carrier liability limits than those applicable to domestic flights The DOT has been active in implementing a variety of consumer protection regulations covering subjects such as advertising passenger communications denied boarding compensation and tarmac delay response Airlines are subject to enforcement actions that are brought by the DOT from time to time for alleged violations of consumer protection and other economic regulations We are not aware of any enforcement proceedings that could either materially affect our financial position or impact our authority to operate  FAA The FAA through Federal Aviation Regulations FARs generally regulates all aspects of airline operations including establishing personnel maintenance and flight operation standards Domestic airlines are required to hold a valid air carrier operating certificate issued by the FAA Pursuant to these regulations we have established and the FAA has approved our operations specifications and a maintenance program for each type of aircraft we operate Each maintenance program provides for the ongoing maintenance of the relevant aircraft type ranging from frequent routine inspections to major overhauls From time to time the FAA issues airworthiness directives ADs that must be incorporated into our aircraft maintenance program and operations All airlines are subject to enforcement actions that are brought by the FAA from time to time for alleged violations of FARs or ADs At this time we are not aware of any enforcement proceedings that could either materially affect our financial position or impact our authority to operate  TSA Airlines serving the US must operate a TSAapproved Aircraft Operator Standard Security Program AOSSP and comply with TSA Security Directives SDs and regulations Under TSA authority we are required to collect a September 11 Security Fee of 560 per oneway trip from passengers and remit that sum to the government to fund aviation security me asures Airlines are subject to enforcement actions that are brought by the TSA from time to time for alleged violations of the AOSSP SDs or security regulations We are not aware of any enforcement proceedings that could either materially affect our financial position or impact our authority to operate The Department of Justice and DOT have jurisdiction over airline antitrust matters The US Postal Service has jurisdiction over certain aspects of the transportation of mail and related services Labor relations in the air transportation industry are regulated under the Railway Labor Act To the extent we continue to fly to foreign countries and pursue alliances with international carriers we may be subject to certain regulations of foreign agencies and international treaties ENVIRONMENTAL AND OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY MATTERS We are subject to various laws and government regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the US and other countries We are also subject to the oversight of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration OSHA concerning employee safety and health matters The US Environmental Protection Agency OSHA and other federal agencies have been authorized to create and enforce regulations that have an impact on our operations In addition to these federal activities various states have been delegated certain authorities under these federal statutes Many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations We maintain our safety health and environmental programs in order to meet or exceed these requirements In the future there may be legislation to reduce carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions Over the course of several years we have transitioned to more fuelefficient aircraft fleets and reduced our emissions with the goal of continuing that trend The Airport Noise and Capacity Act recognizes the rights of airport operators with noise problems to implement local noise abatement programs so long as they do not interfere unreasonably with interstate or foreign commerce or the national air transportation system Authorities in several cities have established aircraft noise reduction programs including the imposition of nighttime curfews We believe we have sufficient scheduling flexibility to accommodate local noise restrictions Although we do not currently anticipate that these regulatory matters individually or collectively will have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows new regulations or compliance issues that we do not currently anticipate could have the potential to harm our financial condition results of operations or cash flows in future periods 18 INSURANCE We carry insurance of types customary in the airline industry and in amounts deemed adequate to protect our interests and property and to comply both with federal regulations and certain credit and lease agreements The insurance policies principally provide coverage for Airline Hull Spares and Comprehensive Legal Liability War and Allied Perils and Workers Compensation In addition we currently carry a Cyber Insurance policy in the event of security breaches from malicious parties We believe that our emphasis on safety and our stateoftheart flight deck safety technology help to control the cost of our insurance WHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION Our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission including our annual

ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS If any of the following occurs our business financial condition and results of operations could suffer The trading price of our common stock could also decline We operate in a continually changing business environment In this environment new risks may emerge and already identified risks may vary significantly in terms of impact and likelihood of occurrence Management cannot predict such developments nor can it assess the impact if any on our business of such new risk factors or of events described in any forwardlooking statements We have adopted an enterprisewide risk analysis and oversight program designed to identify the various risks faced by the organization assign responsibility for managing those risks to individual executives as well as align these risks with Board oversight These enterprisewide risks have been aligned to the risk factors discussed below SAFETY COMPLIANCE AND OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE Our reputation and financial results could be harmed in the event of an airline accident or incident An accident or incident involving one of our aircraft or an aircraft operated by one of our codeshare partners or CPA carriers could involve a significant loss of life and result in a loss of confidence in our Company by the flying public andor aviation authorities We could experience significant claims from injured passengers bystanders and surviving relatives as well as costs for the repair or replacement of a damaged aircraft and temporary or permanent loss from service We maintain liability insurance in amounts and of the type generally consistent with industry practice as do our codeshare partners and CPA carriers However the amount of such coverage may not be adequate to fully cover all claims and we may be forced to bear substantial economic losses from such event Substantial claims resulting from an accident in excess of our related insurance coverage would harm our business and financial results Moreover any aircraft accident or incident even if it is fully insured and does not involve one of our aircraft could cause a public perception that our airlines or the aircraft we or our partners fly are less safe or reliable than other transportation alternatives This would harm our business Our operations are often affected by factors beyond our control including delays cancellations and other conditions which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations As is the case for all airlines our operations often are affected by delays cancellations and other conditions caused by factors largely beyond our control Factors that might impact our operations include  congestion andor space constraints at airports specifically in our hub locations of Seattle Los Angeles and San Francisco  air traffic control problems  lack of operational approval eg new routes aircraft deliveries etc  adverse weather conditions  increased security measures or breaches in security  contagious illness and fear of contagion  changes in international treaties concerning air rights  international or domestic conflicts or terrorist activity and 20  other changes in business conditions Due to our concentration of flights along the West Coast and Alaska we believe a large portion of our operation is more susceptible to air traffic control delays Additionally due to our concentration of flights in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska we believe a large portion of our operation is more susceptible to adverse weather conditions A general reduction in airline passenger traffic as a result of any of the abovementioned factors could harm our business financial condition and results of operations Changes in government regulation imposing additional requirements and restrictions on our operations could increase our operating costs and result in service delays and disruptions Airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal requirements both domestically and internationally that involve significant compliance costs In the last several years Congress has passed laws and the US DOT the TSA and the FAA have issued regulations that have required significant expenditures relating to maintenance of aircraft operation of airlines and broadening of consumer protections Similarly there are a number of legislative and regulatory initiatives and reforms at the federal state and local levels These initiatives include increasingly stringent laws to protect the environment minimum wage requirements mandatory paid sick or family leave and health care mandates They could affect our relationship with our workforce and the vendors that serve our airlines and cause our expenses to increase without an ability to pass through these costs Almost all commercial service airports are owned andor operated by units of local or state governments Airlines are largely dependent on these governmental entities to provide adequate airport facilities and capacity at an affordable cost Many airports have increased their rates and charges to air carriers to reflect higher costs of security updates to infrastructure and other Additional laws regulations taxes airport rates and airport charges may be occasionally proposed that could significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce the demand for air travel Although lawmakers may impose these additional fees and view them as passthrough costs we believe that a higher total ticket price will influence consumer purchase and travel decisions and may result in an overall decline in passenger traffic which would harm our business The airline industry continues to face potential security concerns and related costs Terrorist attacks the fear of such attacks or other hostilities involving the US could have a significant negative effect on the airline industry including us and could  significantly reduce passenger traffic and yields as a result of a potentially dramatic drop in demand for air travel  significantly increase security and insurance costs  make war risk or other insurance unavailable or extremely expensive  increase fuel costs and the volatility of fuel prices  increase costs from airport shutdowns flight cancellations and delays resulting from security breaches and perceived safety threats and  result in a grounding of commercial air traffic by the FAA The occurrence of any of these events would harm our business financial condition and results of operations We rely on thirdparty vendors for certain critical activities We rely on outside vendors for a variety of services and functions critical to our business including airframe and engine maintenance regional flying ground handling fueling computer reservation system hosting telecommunication systems information technology infrastructure and services and deicing Even though we strive to formalize agreements with these vendors that define expected service levels our use of outside vendors increases our exposure to several risks In the event that one or more vendors go into bankruptcy ceases operation or fails to perform as promised replacement services may not be readily available at competitive rates or at all If one of our vendors fails to perform adequately we may experience increased costs delays maintenance issues safety issues or negative 21 public perception of our airline Vendor bankruptcies unionization regulatory compliance issues or significant changes in the competitive marketplace among suppliers could adversely affect vendor services or force us to renegotiate existing agreements on less favorable terms These events could result in disruptions in our operations or increases in our cost structure INTEGRATION OF VIRGIN AMERICA We may be unable to effectively integrate Virgin Americas business and realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition We must devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of Virgin America Potential difficulties we may encounter as part of the integration process include the following  the challenges associated with integrating Virgin America employees into Alaskas workforce including seniority list integration and negotiation of transition process agreements while maintaining our focus on providing consistent high quality customer service  the inability to successfully attract and retain Virgin America guests upon integration with Alaska  the challenges associated with integrating complex systems technology aircraft fleets networks facilities and other assets in a seamless manner that minimizes any adverse impact on guests suppliers employees and other constituents and  the challenges associated with operating aircraft types new to our operations specifically the Airbus A319 A320 and A321neo Any of the foregoing factors could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with guests suppliers employees and other constituencies or our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition on a timely basis or at all These factors could also reduce our earnings or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results In addition integration requirements have caused and may continue to cause a delay of other strategic initiatives The need to integrate Virgin Americas workforce into collective bargaining agreements with Alaskas workforce presents the potential for delay in achieving expected synergies and other benefits or labor disputes that could adversely affect our operations and costs The successful integration of Virgin America and achievement of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition depend significantly on integrating Virgin Americas employees into Alaska and on maintaining productive employee relations Failure to do so presents the potential for delays in achieving expected synergies and other benefits of integration or labor disputes that could adversely affect our operations and costs The process for integrating labor groups in an airline merger is governed by a combination of the Railway Labor Act the McCaskillBond Act and where applicable the existing provisions of our CBAs in addition to internal union policies As part of the transition agreement with the pilot workgroup there is a temporary fence between Alaska and Virgin America pilots requiring that only Alaska pilots operate Boeing aircraft and only Virgin America pilots operate Airbus aircraft Through the implementation of the recent Joint Collective Bargaining Agreement that now applies to all pilots from both airlines this fence will be removed when the two groups are combined into a single scheduling system later in 2018 In addition flight attendants dispatchers and mechanics cannot be fully integrated until transition agreements have been reached and single seniority lists have been provided to the Company by each workgroup Achievement of expected synergies and other benefits will be delayed until the time that operational integration is obtained We will need to launch certain branding or rebranding initiatives in connection with the integration that may take a significant amount of time and involve substantial costs and that may not be favorably received by our guests We may incur substantial costs as a result of rebranding Virgin Americas products and services including updating the aircraft livery and configuration and may not be able to achieve or maintain brand name recognition or status that is comparable to the recognition and status previously enjoyed by Virgin America in any of Virgin Americas markets The failure of any such rebranding initiatives could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain guests which could cause us not to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits contemplated to result from the acquisition 22 We are expected to incur substantial expenses related to the integration of Virgin America We are expected to continue to incur substantial integration and transition expenses in connection with the acquisition of Virgin America including the necessary costs associated with integrating the operations of Alaska and Virgin America There are a large number of processes policies procedures operations technologies and systems that must be integrated including ticketingdistribution maintenance and flight operations While we have assumed that a certain level of expenses will be incurred there are many factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or the timing of the integration expenses Moreover many of the expenses that will be incurred are by their nature difficult to estimate accurately These expenses could particularly in the near term exceed the financial benefits we expect to achieve from the acquisition including the elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale and cost savings These integration expenses likely will continue to result in us taking charges against earnings in future periods and the amount and timing of such charges are uncertain at present The application of the acquisition method of accounting resulted in us recording a significant amount of goodwill which could result in significant future impairment charges and negatively affect our financial results In accordance with applicable acquisition accounting rules we recorded goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet to the extent the Virgin America acquisition purchase price exceeded the net fair value of Virgin Americas tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually We could record impairment charges in our results of operations as a result of among other items extreme fuel price volatility a significant decline in the fair value of certain tangible or intangible assets unfavorable trends in forecasted results of operations and cash flows uncertain economic environment and other uncertainties We can provide no assurance that a significant impairment charge will not occur in one or more future periods Any such charges may materially negatively affect our financial results We obtain our rights to use the Virgin brand under agreements with certain entities affiliated with the Virgin Group and we would lose those rights if these agreements are terminated or not renewed Virgin America is a party to license agreements with certain entities affiliated with the Virgin Group pursuant to which we obtain rights to use the Virgin brand The licensor may terminate the agreements upon the occurrence of a number of specified events including if Virgin America commits a material breach of its obligations under the agreements that is uncured for more than 10 business days or if it materially damages the Virgin brand If we lose our rights to use the Virgin brand our current plan to discontinue use of the Virgin America trademarks gradually would need to be accelerated which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition The Virgin brand is not under our control and negative publicity related to the Virgin brand name could materially adversely affect our business Virgin America licenses rights to the Virgin brand from certain entities affiliated with the Virgin Group on a nonexclusive basis The Virgin brand is also licensed to and used by a number of other companies including two airlines Virgin Atlantic Airways and Virgin Australia Airlines operating in other geographies We rely on the general goodwill of consumers and our employees towards the Virgin brand Consequently any adverse publicity in relation to the Virgin brand name its principals particularly Sir Richard Branson who is closely associated with the brand or another Virginbranded company over which we have no control or influence could have a material adverse effect on our business STRATEGY The airline industry is highly competitive and susceptible to price discounting and changes in capacity which could have a material adverse effect on our business If we cannot successfully compete in the marketplace our business financial condition and operating results will be materially adversely affected The US airline industry is characterized by substantial price competition In recent years the market share held by lowcost carriers and ultra lowcost carriers has increased significantly and is expected to continue to increase Airlines also compete for market share by increasing or decreasing their capacity route systems and the number of markets served Several of our competitors have increased their capacity in markets we serve particularly in our key West Coast markets The resulting increased competition in both domestic and international markets may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition or liquidity 23 We continue to strive toward maintaining and improving our competitive cost structure by setting aggressive costreduction goals This is an important part of our business strategy of offering the best value to our guests through low fares while achieving acceptable profit margins and return on capital If we are unable to maintain our cost advantage over the longterm and achieve sustained targeted returns on invested capital we will likely not be able to grow our business in the future or weather industry downturns Therefore our financial results may suffer The airline industry may undergo further restructuring consolidation or the creation or modification of alliances or joint ventures any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations We continue to face strong competition from other carriers due to restructuring consolidation and the creation and modification of alliances and joint ventures Since deregulation both the US and international airline industries have experienced consolidation through a number of mergers and acquisitions Carriers may also improve their competitive positions through airline alliances slot swapsacquisitions andor joint ventures Certain airline joint ventures further competition by allowing airlines to coordinate routes pool revenues and costs and enjoy other mutual benefits achieving many of the benefits of consolidation Our concentration in certain markets could cause us to be disproportionately impacted by adverse changes in circumstances in those locations Our strategy includes being the premier carrier for people living on the West Coast This results in a high concentration of our business in key West Coast markets A significant portion of our flights occur to and from our Seattle Portland and Bay Area hubs In 2017  passengers to and from Seattle Portland and the Bay Area accounted for 81 of our total guests We believe that concentrating our service offerings in this way allows us to maximize our investment in personnel aircraft and ground facilities as well as to gain greater advantage from sales and marketing efforts in those regions As a result we remain highly dependent on our key markets Our business could be harmed by any circumstances causing a reduction in demand for air transportation in our key markets An increase in competition in our key markets could also cause us to reduce fares or take other competitive measures that if sustained could harm our business financial condition and results of operations We are dependent on a limited number of suppliers for aircraft and parts Alaska is dependent on Boeing as its sole supplier for aircraft and many aircraft parts Virgin America is similarly dependent on Airbus and Horizon is dependent on Bombardier and Embraer Additionally each carrier is dependent on sole suppliers for aircraft engines for each aircraft type As a result we are more vulnerable to issues associated with the supply of those aircraft and parts including design defects mechanical problems contractual performance by the manufacturers or adverse perception by the public that would result in customer avoidance or in actions by the FAA Additionally further consolidation amongst aircraft and aircraft parts manufacturers could further limit the number of suppliers This could result in an inability to operate our aircraft or instability in the foreign countries in which the aircraft and its parts are manufactured We rely on partner airlines for codeshare and frequent flyer marketing arrangements Our airlines are parties to marketing agreements with a number of domestic and international air carriers or partners These agreements provide that certain flight segments operated by us are held out as partner codeshare flights and that certain partner flights are held out for sale as Alaska or Virgin America codeshare flights In addition the agreements generally provide that members of Alaskas Mileage Plan program can earn credit on or redeem credit for partner flights and vice versa We receive revenue from flights sold under codeshare and from interline arrangements In addition we believe that the frequent flyer arrangements are an important part of our frequent flyer program The loss of a significant partner through bankruptcy consolidation or otherwise could have a negative effect on our revenues or the attractiveness of our Mileage Plan program which we believe is a source of competitive advantage We routinely engage in analysis and discussions regarding our own strategic position including alliances codeshare arrangements interline arrangements and frequent flyer program enhancements and may have future discussions with other airlines regarding similar activities If other airlines participate in consolidation or reorganization those airlines may significantly improve their cost structures or revenue generation capabilities thereby potentially making them stronger competitors of ours and potentially impairing our ability to realize expected benefits from our own strategic relationships 24 Economic uncertainty or another recession would likely impact demand for our product and could harm our financial condition and results of operations The airline industry which is subject to relatively high fixed costs and highly variable and unpredictable demand is particularly sensitive to changes in economic conditions We are also highly dependent on US consumer confidence and the health of the US economy Unfavorable US economic conditions have historically driven changes in travel patterns and have resulted in reduced spending for both leisure and business travel For some consumers leisure travel is a discretionary expense and shorter distance travelers in particular have the option to replace air travel with surface travel Businesses are able to forgo air travel by using communication alternatives such as videoconferencing or may be more likely to purchase less expensive tickets to reduce costs which can result in a decrease in average revenue per seat Unfavorable economic conditions also hamper the ability of airlines to raise fares to counteract increased fuel labor and other costs Unfavorable or even uncertain economic conditions could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY We rely heavily on automated systems to operate our business and a failure to invest in new technology or a disruption of our current systems or their operators could harm our business We depend on automated systems to operate our business including our airline reservation system our telecommunication systems our website our maintenance systems our checkin kiosks mobile devices and other systems Substantially all of our tickets are issued to our guests as electronic tickets and the majority of our customers check in using our website airport kiosks or our mobile application We depend on our reservation system to be able to issue track and accept these electronic tickets In order for our operations to work efficiently we must continue to invest in new technology to ensure that our website reservation system and checkin systems are able to accommodate a high volume of traffic maintain information security and deliver important flight information Substantial or repeated website reservations system or telecommunication systems failures or service disruptions could reduce the attractiveness of our services and cause our guests to do business with another airline In addition we rely on other automated systems for crew scheduling flight dispatch and other operational needs We also plan to move our primary data center location Disruptions failed migration untimely recovery or a breach of these systems or the data center could result in the loss of important data an increase of our expenses an impact on our operational performance or a possible temporary cessation of our operations If we do not maintain the privacy and security of our information we could damage our reputation and incur substantial legal and regulatory costs We accept store and transmit information about our guests our employees our business partners and our business In addition we frequently rely on thirdparty hosting sites and data processors including cloud providers Our sensitive information relies on secure transmission over public and private networks A compromise of our systems the security of our infrastructure or those of other business partners that result in our information being accessed or stolen by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our operations and our reputation FINANCIAL CONDITION AND FINANCIAL MARKETS Our business financial condition and results of operations are substantially exposed to the volatility of jet fuel prices Significant increases in jet fuel costs would harm our business Fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our total operating expenses Future increases in the price of jet fuel may harm our business financial condition and results of operations unless we are able to increase fares and fees or add additional ancillary services to attempt to recover increasing fuel costs Our indebtedness and other fixed obligations could lead to liquidity constraints that may restrict our activities We incurred a significant amount of new debt to finance our acquisition of Virgin America We now have and will continue to have for the foreseeable future a substantial amount of debt Due to our high fixed costs including aircraft lease commitments and debt service a decrease in revenues would result in a disproportionately greater decrease in earnings 25 Our outstanding longterm debt and other fixed obligations could have important consequences For example they could limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our future capital expenditures working capital or other purposes require us to dedicate a material portion of our operating cash flow to fund lease payments and interest payments on indebtedness thereby reducing funds available for other purposes or limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions Although we have historically been able to generate sufficient cash flow from our operations to pay our debt and other fixed obligations when they become due we cannot ensure we will be able to do so in the future If we fail to do so our business could be harmed Our maintenance costs will increase as our fleet ages and we will periodically incur substantial maintenance costs due to the timing of maintenance events of our aircraft As of December 31 2017  the average age of our NextGen aircraft B737800 900 900ERs was approximately 75 years the average age of our A319 A320 and A321neo aircraft was approximately 73 years the average age of our Embraer E175 aircraft was approximately 12 years and the average age of our Q400 aircraft was approximately 11 years Our relatively new aircraft require less maintenance currently than they will in the future Any significant increase in maintenance expenses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations Our ability to use Virgin Americas net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income for US federal and state income tax purposes may be limited if we are unable to earn adequate taxable income in future periods Our ability to use the net operating loss carryforwards NOLs will depend on the amount of taxable income generated in future periods The NOLs may expire before we can generate sufficient taxable income to utilize the NOLs BRAND AND REPUTATION As we evolve our brand to appeal to a changing demographic and grow into new markets we will engage in strategic initiatives that may not be favorably received by all of our guests We continue to focus on strategic initiatives designed to increase our brand appeal to a diverse and evolving demographic of airline travelers These efforts could include significant enhancements to our inairport and onboard environments increasing our direct customer relationships through improvements to our purchasing portals digital and mobile and optimization of our customer loyalty programs In pursuit of these efforts we may negatively affect our reputation with some of our existing customer base LABOR RELATIONS AND LABOR STRATEGY A significant increase in labor costs unsuccessful attempts to strengthen our relationships with union employees or loss of key personnel could adversely affect our business and results of operations Labor costs are a significant component of our total expenses Each of Alaska Horizon Virgin America and McGee Air Services represented employee groups has a separate collective bargaining agreement In relation to the Virgin America integration the workgroups that have not yet reached a transition agreement could make demands that would increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our financial performance if we agree to them The same result could apply if we experience a significant increase in vendor labor costs including wage rate increases which could ultimately flow through to us under the applicable services agreement Although we have a long track record of fostering good communications negotiating approaches and developing other strategies to enhance workforce engagement in our longterm vision future uncertainty around open contractsincluding the collective bargaining negotiations for the integration of Alaskas and Virgin Americas represented work groupscould be a distraction affecting employee focus on our business and diverting managements attention from other projects and issues We compete against the major US airlines and other businesses for labor in many highly skilled positions If we are unable to hire train and retain qualified employees at a reasonable cost achieve and sustain employee engagement in our strategic vision or if we are unsuccessful at implementing succession plans for our key staff we may be unable to grow or sustain our business 26 Employees could also engage in job actions such as slowdowns worktorule campaigns sickouts or other actions designed to disrupt our normal operations in an attempt to pressure us to acquiesce to wage or other demands during Section 6 negotiations or transition agreement discussions Although the Railway Labor Act makes such selfhelp unlawful until the National Mediation Board releases the parties following lengthy mediation attempts such actions could cause significant harm even if we were ultimately successful in seeking injunctive relief or other remedies The inability to attract retain and train regional pilots could result in guest impact and adversely affect our business and results of operations In recent years there have been shortages of pilots for hire in the regional market and there is an anticipated pilot shortage in hiring in the mainline markets in the next two to three years Attrition beyond normal levels or the inability to attract new pilots could negatively impact our operating results and our business prospects could be harmed In addition the ability to train pilot candidates in a timely manner to support Alaskas operational needs may continue to be a challenge for Horizon Air Due to the high volume of turnover partially driven by the hiring needs of mainline carriers pilot training may face added stress associated with ensuring initial training recurrent training and upgrades from first officer to captain are accomplished in a manner timely enough to support Alaskas operational needs Any of these outcomes would possibly result in guest impact and harm to our business financial condition and results of operations ITEM 1B UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None ITEM 2 PROPERTIES AIRCRAFT The following table describes the

and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses future orders and options for additional aircraft Liquidity and Capital Resources provides more information about aircraft that are used to secure longterm debt arrangements or collateralize credit facilities Alaskas leased B737 aircraft have lease expiration dates between 2018 and 2026  Virgin Americas leased A319 A320 and A321neo aircraft have expiration dates between 2019 and 2029  Horizons leased Q400 aircraft have expiration dates between 2018 and 2021  The leased E175 aircraft are through our capacity purchase agreement with SkyWest Alaska Virgin America and Horizon have the option to extend some of the leases for additional periods or the right to purchase the aircraft at the end of the lease term usually at the fairmarket value of the aircraft 27 GROUND FACILITIES AND SERVICES We own terminal buildings in various cities in the state of Alaska and several buildings located at or near SeattleTacoma International Airport SeaTac near Seattle WA These include a multibay hangar and shops complex used primarily for line maintenance a flight operations and training center an air cargo facility an information technology office and data center and various other commercial office buildings Additionally in 2017 we entered into a contract to acquire property near our existing headquarters facility for the development of additional office space We lease ticket counters gates cargo and baggage space ground equipment office space and other support areas at the majority of the airports we serve Airport leases contain provisions for periodic adjustments of lease rates We are typically responsible for maintenance insurance and other facilityrelated expenses and services under these agreements We also lease operations training administrative and data center facilities in Burlingame CA Portland OR Quincy WA and Spokane WA as well as line maintenance stations in Boise ID Bellingham WA Eugene OR San Jose CA Medford OR Redmond OR Seattle WA Kent WA and Spokane WA Further we lease call center facilities in Phoenix AZ and Boise ID ITEM 3 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS We are a party to routine litigation matters incidental to our business Management believes the ultimate disposition of these matters is not likely to materially affect our financial position or results of operations This forwardlooking statement is based on managements current understanding of the relevant law and facts and it is subject to various contingencies including the potential costs and risks associated with litigation and the actions of judges and juries In 2015 three flight attendants filed a class action lawsuit seeking to represent all Virgin America flight attendants for damages based on alleged violations of California and City of San Francisco wage and hour laws Plaintiffs received class certification in November 2016 Virgin America filed a motion for summary judgment seeking to dismiss all claims on various federal preemption grounds In January 2017 the Court denied in part and granted in part Virgin Americas motion The Company believes the claims in this case are without factual and legal merit and intends to defend this lawsuit ITEM 4 MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES Not applicable PART II
