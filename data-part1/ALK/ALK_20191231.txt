PART I ITEM 1 OUR BUSINESS Alaska Air Group is a Delaware corporation incorporated in 1985 that operates two airlines Alaska and Horizon Alaska was organized in 1932 and incorporated in 1937 in the state of Alaska Horizon is a Washington corporation that was incorporated and began service in 1981 and was acquired by Air Group in 1986 Virgin America was a member of Air Group since it was acquired in 2016 until 2018 when Alaska and Virgin America combined operating certificates to become a single airline and legally merged into a single entity The Company also includes McGee Air Services an aviation services provider that was established as a whollyowned subsidiary of Alaska in 2016 Alaska and Horizon operate as separate airlines with individual business plans competitive factors and economic risks Together with our regional airline partners we fly to 115 destinations with over 1300 daily departures through an expansive network across the US Mexico Canada and Costa Rica With global airline partners we provide our guests with a network of more than 800 destinations worldwide During 2019 we carried an alltime high 47 million guests and earned consolidated net income under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP of 769 million compared to net income of 437 million in 2018 Our adjusted net income was 798 million which excludes mergerrelated costs and marktomarket fuel hedge adjustments Refer to Results of Operations in Managements Discussion and Analysis for our reconciliation of NonGAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure We organize the business and review financial operating performance by aggregating our business in three operating segments which are as follows  Mainline  includes scheduled air transportation on Alaskas Boeing and Airbus jet aircraft for passengers and cargo throughout the US and in parts of Mexico and Costa Rica  Regional  includes Horizons and other thirdparty carriers scheduled air transportation for passengers across a shorter distance network within the US under capacity purchase agreements CPA This segment includes the actual revenues and expenses associated with regional flying as well as an allocation of corporate overhead incurred by Air Group on behalf of the regional operations  Horizon  includes the capacity sold to Alaska under a CPA Expenses include those typically borne by regional airlines such as crew costs ownership costs and maintenance costs Our purpose is creating an airline people love The ing is to recognize that we are never done we are continually working to improve We believe our success depends on our ability to provide safe air transportation develop relationships with guests by providing exceptional customer service and low fares and maintain a low cost structure to compete effectively It is important to us that we achieve our objective as a socially responsible company that values not just performance but also our people the communities we serve and the environment We marked the 16th consecutive year of profitability on an adjusted basis in 2019 Our liquidity and capital position remain strong positioning us among other highquality industrial companies Due to our strong financial health and outlook we are one of only three US airlines with investment grade credit ratings The cash generated by our continued success enables us to invest in our business to deliver profitable growth enhance our guests experience and improve our financial position We are active in the communities we serve and strive to be an industry leader in environmental and community stewardship In 2019 Air Group donated 15 million in cash and inkind travel to over 1200 charitable organizations and our employees volunteered more than 41000 hours of community service related to youth and education medical research and transportation One of our leadership principles is to give back and we are proud of the efforts and voluntarism of our employees Also in 2019 we launched LIFT our social and environmental impact program aimed at uniting all of our social and environmental impact efforts Through this program our guests also showed great generosity donating 72 million miles in 2019 for donation to charitable organizations As recognition of our community leadership financial stability and the fact that our combined fleet is one of the youngest and most fuelefficient in North America we ranked higher than any other North American airline for the third year in a row on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index In 2019 we completed the majority of the remaining integration milestones from our acquisition of Virgin America During the year Alaska flight attendants began flying as integrated crews and our pilots adopted an integrated seniority list In July 2019 Alaska aircraft maintenance technicians represented by the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association AMFA ratified an 4 agreement bringing our last work group under a single collective bargaining agreement We also finished painting the remainder of the Airbus fleet in the Alaska livery and completed interior cabin renovations on 60 of the Airbus fleet With the integration largely behind us we have shifted our focus towards our vision and strategy for the next five years This strategy has three major pillars People Our success depends on our more than 24000 employees living our values every day to deliver awardwinning customer service as one team We know engaged employees deliver higher productivity superior execution and better guest experiences which is why investing in our people is imperative to our future success In 2019 we completed Flight Path  a program that brought all Alaska and Horizon employees together through leaderled sessions to inform engage and set the course for our business and culture Aside from onetime programs we continue to communicate with employees through a variety of vehicles including weekly Leader Look Ahead and periodic livestreamed webcasts to provide employees better information and a stronger connection to organizational priorities Our efforts were recognized by Forbes Magazine who named Alaska as one of the Worlds Best Employers for the fifth year in a row for 2019 and as one of Americas Best Employers for Diversity in 2020 Aligning our employees goals with Air Groups goals has been an important contributor to our strong track record of accomplishments and financial performance The majority of Alaska and Horizon employees participate in our PerformanceBased Pay PBP and Operational Performance Rewards OPR programs which encourage employees to work together to achieve metrics related to the Companys strategy  including safety profitability ontime performance low costs customer loyalty and customer satisfaction Over the last ten years our incentive programs have paid out on average more than one months pay for most employees In 2019 our employees earned more than 150 million under these incentive programs Growth Driving growth will require our focus in a variety of areas including a powerful brand optimized network and strong revenue generation  Powerful brand  P roviding genuine and caring service to our guests is key to our success and loyalty to the Alaska brand This service is demonstrated daily by our employees who are empowered to make the best choices for our guests As proof in 2019 Alaska ranked first in the JD Power and Associates annual survey of customer satisfaction among traditional network carriers for the 12th year in a row Alaska was also recognized for excellent service by Cond Nast Traveler and Travel  Leisure magazine for the second consecutive year continuing an achievement earned by Virgin America for the preceding ten years Our award winning Mileage Plan TM is another way we build longterm guest relationships and grow our brand We maintain the only distancebased frequent flier program in the United States which rewards all fliers regardless of the price they paid for their tickets In 2019 we increased our signup promotion for new cardholders to 40000 miles providing immediate utility of the program We also offered promotions like Buy One Get One Free companion fares and continued popular redemption benefits including using miles for hotel redemptions with access to over 400000 hotels worldwide and adding EL AL Airlines as a new global partner Over the past two years we initiated a refresh of many of our amenities with the aim of highlighting our West Coast roots From updated onboard offerings including fresh and local food to local craft beers and wines as well as updating our inair WiFi to meet the evolving needs of our guests we will continue to innovate and evolve to provide our guests with the best experience Work towards updated guestfacing amenities continued in 2019 with our flagship lounge opening in the North Satellite at SeaTac Airport as well as the announcement of a new lounge at San Francisco International Airport which is expected to open in the second half of 2020 We also strive to connect with West Coast guests through key sponsorships including Russell Wilson the San Jose Sharks San Francisco Giants Seattle Mariners Portland Timbers Seattles new NHL team and more  Optimized Network  The acquisition of Virgin America positioned us as the fifth largest airline in the US with an unparalleled ability to serve West Coast travelers We offer the highest guest relevance of any carrier from the West Coast Competition in our markets is significant and we know that we must defend our customer base as we grow our network presence by providing guests with an increased choice of schedule times and fares We are intensely focused on providing the most utility and routes to our guests From our West Coast hub cities we lead all other airlines in 5 nonstop markets daily flights and seat share In 2019 we began departures from Paine FieldSnohomish County Airport in Everett Washington to ten West Coast markets We also optimized our current network and reallocated flying to expand offerings between the Pacific Northwest and California increasing network utility and providing more nonstop service on the West Coast  Revenue Generation  In 2018 we introduced our Saver Fare product which offers greater choice for our guests allowing them to purchase and pay for the ticket type and other amenities they value most In 2019 our Saver Fare product provided meaningful revenue growth and is expected to continue to provide incremental revenue into 2020 This combined with synergies from the merger which are expected to hit their full run rate in 2021 and capacity growth will enable us to continue to grow our annual revenues Innovation will also be key to growth in our revenues We will focus our efforts on merchandising and demand generation including through a variety of unique marketing strategies aimed at increasing revenues in typically offpeak periods Business Model Safety is the foundation of everything we do and remains our top priority We have an unwavering commitment to run a safe operation and we will not compromise this commitment in the pursuit of other initiatives Alaska and Horizon were the first US major airlines to receive FAA validation and acceptance of their Safety Management Systems SMS in 2016 In 2018 we used SMS to safely and consistently guide our integration with the legacy Virgin America operation Report It our mobile safety reporting application makes it easier for employees to file safety reports In 2018 100 of our Alaska and Horizon aircraft technicians completed the requirements for the FAAs Diamond Certificate of Excellence award marking the 17th consecutive year Alaska has received the award and the 17th time in the last 19 years Horizon has received this award In early 2020 we were again included as one of only two US airlines on the AirlineRatingscom list of the worlds Top 20 safest airlines We believe that maintaining safe operations through adherence to welldefined processes and ensuring every Air Group employee is aware of their individual contribution to our operation is critical to ensuring ontime performance The rigor we apply to running a safe operation has resulted in Alaska consistently being one of the top airlines in North America for ontime performance and Horizon was recognized once again as the leader in ontime performance in 2019 among regional airlines Ultimately our success will be driven by our business model being flexible and innovative as we drive towards our pretax margin goals of 13 to 15 and our growth goals of 4 to 6 over the business cycle We know that in order to provide low fares in our growing network while generating strong returns for our shareholders it is imperative for us to maintain a competitive cost structure In 2019 our unit costs excluding fuel and special items increased 23 on a consolidated basis Although our unit costs are expected to rise again in 2020 primarily due to general wage inflation higher engine maintenance on both our Airbus and B737800 fleets and increased lease return costs associated with our Airbus fleet we will continue our focus on lowering overhead improving productivity and managing vendor costs We are also actively managing fuel costs by flying larger more fuelefficient aircraft which has increased our fuel efficiency as measured by available seat miles flown per gallon by 16 over the last five years We have a long track record of effective cost control and we remain keenly committed to protecting our unit cost advantage relative to competitors AIR GROUP Our airlines operate different aircraft and missions Alaska operates a fleet of narrowbody passenger jets on primarily longerhaul capacity Alaska contracts primarily with Horizon and SkyWest Airlines Inc SkyWest for shorterhaul capacity such that Alaska receives all passenger revenue from those flights Horizon operates Embraer 175 E175 regional jet aircraft and Bombardier Q400 turboprop aircraft and sells all of its capacity to Alaska pursuant to a CPA The majority of our revenues are generated by transporting passengers The

FREQUENT FLYER PROGRAM Alaska Airlines Mileage Plan provides a comprehensive suite of frequent flyer benefits Miles can be earned by flying on our airlines or on one of our 18 airline partners by using an Alaska Airlines credit card or through other nonairline partners Alaskas extensive list of airline partners includes carriers associated with each of the three major global alliances making it easier for our members to earn miles and reach elite status in our frequent flyer program Through Alaska and our global partners Mileage Plan members have access to a large network of over 800 worldwide travel destinations Further members can receive up to 40000 bonus miles upon signing up for the Alaska Airlines Visa Signature card and meeting a minimum spend threshold and earn triple miles on Alaska Airlines purchases Alaska Airlines Visa Signature cardholders and small business cardholders in the US and Platinum and World Elite Mastercard cardholders in Canada also receive an annual companion ticket that allows members to purchase an additional ticket for 99 plus taxes with no restrictions or blackout dates and a free first checked bag for up to six people traveling on the same itinerary Earned miles can be redeemed for flights on our airlines or our partner airlines for hotel stays via mileageplanhotelscom or for upgrades to First Class on Alaska Airlines We believe all of these benefits give our Mileage Plan members more value than competing programs Mileage Plan revenues including those in the Passenger revenue income statement line item represented approximately 13 of Air Groups total revenues in 2019 Mileage Plan helps drive revenue growth by attracting new customers keeping existing customers actively engaged and building customer loyalty through the benefits that we provide AGREEMENTS WITH OTHER AIRLINES Our agreements fall into three different categories frequent flyer codeshare and interline agreements Frequent flyer agreements enable our Mileage Plan TM members to earn mileage credits and make redemptions on one of our 18 domestic and international partner airlines Codeshare agreements allow one or more marketing carriers to sell seats on a single operating carrier that services passengers under multiple flight numbers The sale of codeshare seats can vary depending on the sale arrangement For example in a freesale arrangement the marketing carrier sells the operating carriers inventory without any restriction whereas in a blockspace arrangement a fixed amount of seats are sold to the marketing carrier by the operating carrier The interchangeability of the flight code between carriers provides a greater selection of flights for customers along with increased flexibility for mileage accrual and redemption Interline agreements allow airlines to jointly offer a competitive singlefare itinerary to customers traveling via multiple carriers to a final destination An interline itinerary offered by one airline may not necessarily be offered by the other and the fares collected from passengers are prorated and distributed to interline partners according to preexisting agreements between the carriers Frequent flyer codeshare and interline agreements help increase our traffic and revenue by providing a more diverse network and schedule options to our guests Alaska has marketing alliances with a number of airlines that provide frequent flyer and codesharing opportunities Alliances are an important part of our strategy and enhance our revenues by  offering our guests more travel destinations and better mileage creditredemption opportunities including elite qualifying miles on US and international airline partners 8  giving our Mileage Plan TM program a competitive advantage because of our partnership with both unaffiliated international carriers and carriers from all three major worldwide alliances  giving us access to more connecting traffic from other airlines and  providing members of our alliance partners frequent flyer programs an opportunity to travel on Alaska and our regional partners while earning mileage credit in our partners programs Most of our codeshare relationships are freesale codeshares where the marketing carrier sells seats on the operating carriers flights from the operating carriers inventory but takes no inventory risk Our marketing agreements have various termination dates and one or more may be in the process of renegotiation at any time Our codeshare and interline agreements generated 5 5 and 6 of our total marketed revenues as of December 31 2019 2018 and 2017 The comprehensive summary of Alaskas alliances with other airlines is as follows Codeshare Frequent Flyer Agreement Alaska Flight  on Flights Operated by Other Airline Other Airline

majority of cargo services are provided to commercial businesses and the United States Postal Service The Company satisfies cargo service performance obligations and recognizes revenue when the shipment arrives at its final destination or is transferred to a thirdparty carrier for delivery The Company also earns other revenue for lounge memberships hotel and car commissions and certain other immaterial items not intrinsically tied to providing air travel to passengers Revenue is recognized when these services are rendered and recorded as Cargo and other revenue 9 GENERAL The airline industry is highly competitive and subject to various uncertainties including economic conditions volatile fuel prices a largely unionized work force the need to finance large capital expenditures and the related availability of capital government regulationincluding taxes and fees and potential aircraft incidents Airlines have high fixed costs primarily for wages aircraft fuel aircraft ownership and facilities rents Because expenses of a flight do not vary significantly based on the number of passengers carried a relatively small change in the number of passengers or in pricing has a disproportionate effect on an airlines operating and financial results In other words a minor shortfall in expected revenue levels could cause a disproportionately negative impact to our operating and financial results Passenger demand and ticket prices are in large measure influenced by the general state of the economy current global economic and political events and total available airline seat capacity In 2019 the airline industry posted another year of profits and increases over 2018 primarily due to lower fuel prices Although growth was impacted in 2019 following the grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft airlines have continued to make significant investments in airports and new services to differentiate their customer service offering Thus the level of competition is expected to continue to increase FUEL Our business and financial results are highly impacted by the price and the availability of aircraft fuel Aircraft fuel expense includes raw fuel expense or the price that we generally pay at the airport including taxes and fees plus the effect of marktomarket adjustments to our fuel hedge portfolio as the value of that portfolio increases and decreases The cost of aircraft fuel is volatile and outside of our control and it can have a significant and immediate impact on our operating results Over the past five years aircraft fuel expense ranged from 18 to 25 of operating expenses Fuel prices are impacted by changes in both the price of crude oil and refining costs and can vary by region in the US The price of crude oil on an average annual basis for the past five years has ranged from a low of 43 per barrel in 2016 to a high of 65 in 2018 For us a 1 per barrel change in the price of oil equates to approximately 21 million of fuel cost annually Said another way a onecent change in our fuel price per gallon will impact our expected annual fuel cost by approximately 9 million per year Refining margins which represent the price of refining crude oil into aircraft fuel are a smaller portion of the overall price of jet fuel but have also contributed to the price volatility in recent years Over the last five years average annual West Coast refining margin prices have fluctuated from a low of 13 per barrel in 2016 to a high of 26 per barrel in 2019 Generally West Coast jet fuel prices are somewhat higher and more volatile than prices in the Gulf Coast or on the East Coast Our average raw fuel cost per gallon decreased 6 in 2019 after increasing 28 in 2018 and increasing 21 in 2017 The percentages of our aircraft fuel expense by crude oil and refining margins as well as the percentage of our aircraft fuel expense of operating expenses are as follows 2019 2018 2017 2016 a 2015 Crude oil 62  68  66  69  62  Refining margins 28  25  23  20

2016 b Other includes gains and losses on settled fuel hedges unrealized marktomarket fuel hedge gains or losses taxes and other intoplane costs We use crude oil call options as hedges against our exposure to the volatility of jet fuel prices Call options effectively cap our price for crude oil limiting our exposure to increasing fuel prices for about half of our planned fuel consumption With call options we are hedged against spikes in crude oil prices and during a period of declines in crude oil prices we only forfeit cash previously paid for hedge premiums We begin hedging approximately 18 months in advance of consumption 10 We believe that operating fuelefficient aircraft and executing on operational best practices are the best hedges against high fuel prices Maintaining a young fuelefficient fleet helps to reduce our fuel consumption rate but also the amount of greenhouse gases and other pollutants that our aircraft emit COMPETITION Competition in the airline industry is intense and unpredictable Our competitors consist primarily of other airlines and to a lesser extent other forms of transportation Competition can be direct in the form of another carrier flying the exact nonstop route or indirect where a carrier serves the same two cities nonstop from an alternative airport in that city or via an itinerary requiring a connection at another airport We compete with other domestic airlines and a limited number of international airlines on nearly all of our scheduled routes Our largest competitor is Delta Airlines Inc Delta who has significantly increased its capacity in Seattle since 2013 Approximately 76 of our capacity to and from Seattle competes with Delta As we have grown in California and have expanded our transcontinental route offerings United Airlines and Southwest Airlines have also become large competitors and have increased their capacity in markets we serve Our California and transcontinental routes have a higher concentration of competitors when compared to our historical route structure which was predominately concentrated in the Pacific Northwest Based on schedules filed with the US Department of Transportation we expect the amount of competitive capacity overlap with all carriers to increase by more than 1 in the first quarter of 2020 weighted based on our network We believe that the following principal competitive factors are important to our guests  Safety Safety is our top priority and is at the core of everything we do In early 2020 Alaska was again ranked by AirlineRatingscom as one of only two US airlines in the Top 20 safest airlines in the world In 2018 we also received our 17th Diamond Award of Excellence from the Federal Aviation Administration recognizing both Alaska and Horizon aircraft technicians for their commitment to training  Fares and ancillary services Ticket and other fee pricing is a significant competitive factor in the airline industry and the increased availability of fare information on the Internet allows travelers to easily compare fares and identify competitor promotions and discounts Pricing is driven by a variety of factors including but not limited to marketspecific capacity market share per routegeographic area cost structure fare vs ancillary revenue strategies and demand For example airlines often discount fares to drive traffic in new markets or to stimulate traffic when necessary to improve load factors In addition traditional network carriers have been able to reduce their operating costs through bankruptcies and mergers while lowcost carriers have continued to grow their fleets and expand their networks potentially enabling them to better control costs per available seat mile the average cost to fly an aircraft seat one mile which in turn may enable them to lower their fares These factors can reduce our pricing power and that of the airline industry as a whole Domestic airline capacity is dominated by four large carriers representing over 80 of total seats One of our advantages is our low fare with high value position in the industry However given the large concentration of industry capacity some carriers in our markets may discount their fares substantially to develop or increase market share Fares that are substantially below our cost to operate can be harmful if sustained over a long period of time We will defend our core markets and if necessary redeploy capacity to better match supply with demand We believe our strong financial position and low cost advantage enables us to offer competitive fares while still earning returns for our shareholders  Customer service and reputation We compete with other airlines in areas of customer service such as ontime performance and guest amenities  including first class and other premium seating quality of onboard products aircraft type and comfort In 2019 Alaska ranked highest in customer satisfaction among traditional network carriers by JD Power and Associates for the 12th year in a row and was also named as the best US airline by Cond Nast Traveler Additionally in 2019 we opened our new flagship lounge in the North Satellite of SeaTac Airport and began work on our new lounge at San Francisco International Airport We are also in the process of reconfiguring our Airbus aircraft which began in 2018 The new livery and interior reconfiguration will provide guests with one consistent brand experience across the Mainline fleet Airbus livery updates 11 were completed in 2019 while the interior reconfiguration is expected to wrap up in early 2021 We began installation of nextgeneration Gogo inflight satellite based WiFi on our entire Boeing and Airbus fleets in 2018 which is planned to be complete in 2020 Our employees are a key element of our product We have a highly engaged workforce that strives to provide genuine and caring service to our guests both at the airport and onboard We heavily emphasize our service standards with our employees through training and education programs and monetary incentives related to operational performance and guest satisfaction  Routes served flight schedules codesharing and interline relationships and frequent flyer programs We also compete with other airlines based on markets served the frequency of service to those markets and frequent flyer opportunities Some airlines have more extensive route structures than we do and they offer significantly more international routes In order to expand opportunities for our guests we enter into codesharing and interline relationships with other airlines that provide reciprocal frequent flyer mileage credit and redemption privileges These relationships allow us to offer our guests access to more destinations than we can on our own gain exposure in markets we do not serve and allow our guests more opportunities to earn and redeem frequent flyer miles Our Mileage Plan offers some of the most comprehensive benefits to our members with the ability to earn and redeem miles on 18 partner carriers For the fifth year in a row Mileage Plan was ranked first in US News and World Reports list of Best Travel Rewards Programs In addition to domestic or foreign airlines that we compete with on most of our routes we compete with ground transportation in our shorthaul markets To some extent our airlines also compete with technology such as video conferencing and internetbased meeting tools that have changed the need for or frequency of facetoface business meetings TICKET DISTRIBUTION Our tickets are distributed through three primary channels  Direct to customer It is less expensive for us to sell through our direct channel at alaskaaircom We believe direct sales through this channel are preferable from a branding and customer relationship standpoint in that we can establish ongoing communication with the guest and tailor offers accordingly As a result we continue to take steps to drive more business to our website  Traditional and online travel agencies Both traditional and online travel agencies typically use Global Distribution Systems GDS to obtain their fare and inventory data from airlines Bookings made through these agencies result in a fee that is charged to the airline Many of our large corporate customers require us to use these agencies Some of our competitors do not use this distribution channel and as a result have lower ticket distribution costs  Reservation call centers Our call centers are located in Phoenix AZ Kent WA and Boise ID We generally charge a 15 fee for booking reservations through the call centers Our sales by channel are as follows 2019 2018 2017 2016 a 2015 Direct to customer 65  63  62  61  60  Traditional agencies 20  22  22  23  23  Online travel

SEASONALITY AND OTHER FACTORS Our results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of those for the entire year because our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations Our profitability is generally lowest during the first and fourth quarters due principally to fewer departures and passengers Profitability typically increases in the second quarter and then reaches its highest level during the third quarter as a result of vacation travel However we have significantly moderated the impact of seasonality of our operations through continued growth from the West Coast to leisure destinations like Hawaii and Costa Rica and expansion to leisure and business destinations in the midcontinental and eastern US In addition to passenger loads factors that could cause our quarterly operating results to vary include  pricing initiatives by us or our competitors  changes in fuel costs  increases in competition at our primary airports  general economic conditions and resulting changes in passenger demand  increases or decreases in passenger and volumedriven variable costs and  air space and Air Traffic Control delays particularly in Seattle and San Francisco Many of the markets we serve experience inclement weather conditions in the winter causing increased costs associated with deicing aircraft canceling flights and accommodating displaced passengers Due to our geographic area of operations we can be more susceptible to adverse weather conditions particularly in the state of Alaska and the Pacific Northwest than some of our competitors who may be better able to spread the impact of weatherrelated risks over larger route systems No material part of our business or that of our subsidiaries is dependent upon a single customer or upon a few highvolume customers EMPLOYEES Our business is labor intensive As of December 31 2019 we employed 24134 17919 at Alaska 4301 at Horizon and 1914 at McGee Air Services active fulltime and parttime employees Wages and benefits including variable incentive pay represented approximately 43 of our total nonfuel operating expenses in 2019 and 41 in 2018 Most major airlines including Alaska and Horizon have employee groups that are covered by collective bargaining agreements CBAs Airlines with unionized work forces generally have higher labor costs than carriers without unionized work forces and they may not have the ability to adjust labor costs downward quickly enough to respond to new competition or slowing demand As part of the integration we have been working to bring represented work groups under single CBAs In 2019 our aircraft maintenance technicians represented by the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association AMFA ratified a twoyear contract extension bringing Airbus and Boeing technicians under a single CBA Now all five of our unionized groups at Alaska are under joint collective agreements with integrated seniority lists in place At December 31 2019 labor unions represented 86 of Alaskas 43 of Horizons and 87 of McGee Air Services employees Our relations with US labor organizations are governed by the Railway Labor Act RLA Under the RLA collective bargaining agreements do not expire but instead become amendable as of a stated date If either party wishes to modify the terms of any such agreement it must notify the other party in the manner prescribed by the RLA andor described in the agreement After receipt of such notice the parties must meet for direct negotiations and if no agreement is reached either party may request the National Mediation Board to initiate a process including mediation arbitration and a potential cooling off period that must be followed before either party may engage in selfhelp 13 Alaskas union contracts at December 31 2019 were as follows Union

the federal government The Department of Transportation DOT the the Transportation Security Administration TSA and the FAA exercise significant regulatory authority over air carriers  DOT A domestic airline is required to hold a certificate of public convenience and necessity issued by the DOT in order to provide passenger and cargo air transportation in the US Subject to certain individual airport capacity noise and other restrictions this certificate permits an air carrier to operate between any two points in the US Certificates do not expire but may be revoked for failure to comply with federal aviation statutes regulations orders or the terms of the certificates While airlines are permitted to establish their own fares without government regulation the DOT has jurisdiction over the approval of international codeshare agreements marketing alliance agreements between major domestic carriers international and some domestic route authorities Essential Air Service market subsidies carrier liability for personal or property damage and certain airport rates and charges disputes International treaties may also contain restrictions or requirements for flying outside of the US and impose different carrier liability limits than those applicable to domestic flights The DOT has been active in implementing a variety of consumer protection regulations covering subjects such 16 as advertising passenger communications denied boarding compensation and tarmac delay response Airlines are subject to enforcement actions that are brought by the DOT for alleged violations of consumer protection and other economic regulations We are not aware of any enforcement proceedings that could either materially affect our financial position or impact our authority to operate  FAA The FAA through Federal Aviation Regulations FARs generally regulates all aspects of airline operations including establishing personnel maintenance and flight operation standards Domestic airlines are required to hold a valid air carrier operating certificate issued by the FAA Pursuant to these regulations we have established and the FAA has approved our operations specifications and a maintenance program for each type of aircraft we operate Each maintenance program provides for the ongoing maintenance of the relevant aircraft type ranging from frequent routine inspections to major overhauls Periodically the FAA issues airworthiness directives ADs that must be incorporated into our aircraft maintenance program and operations All airlines are subject to enforcement actions that are brought by the FAA from time to time for alleged violations of FARs or ADs At this time we are not aware of any enforcement proceedings that could either materially affect our financial position or impact our authority to operate  TSA Airlines serving the US must operate a TSAapproved Aircraft Operator Standard Security Program AOSSP and comply with TSA Security Directives SDs and regulations Under TSA authority we are required to collect a September 11 Security Fee of 560 per oneway trip from passengers and remit that sum to the government to fund aviation security me asures Airlines are subject to enforcement actions that are brought by the TSA for alleged violations of the AOSSP SDs or security regulations We are not aware of any enforcement proceedings that could either materially affect our financial position or impact our authority to operate The Department of Justice and DOT have jurisdiction over airline antitrust matters The US Postal Service has jurisdiction over certain aspects of the transportation of mail and related services Labor relations in the air transportation industry are regulated under the RLA To the extent we continue to fly to foreign countries and pursue alliances with international carriers we may be subject to certain regulations of foreign agencies and international treaties We are also subject to the oversight of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration OSHA concerning employee safety and health matters The OSHA and other federal agencies have been authorized to create and enforce regulations that have an impact on our operations In addition to these federal activities various states have been delegated certain authorities under these federal statutes Many state and local governments have adopted employee safety and health laws and regulations We maintain our safety and health programs in order to meet or exceed these requirements ENVIRONMENTAL We are also subject to various laws and government regulations concerning environmental matters both domestically and internationally Domestic regulations that have an impact to our operations include the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 the Clean Air Act Resource Conservation and Recovery Act Clean Water Act Safe Drinking Water Act the Comprehensive Environmental Response and Compensation Liability Act the National Environmental Policy Act Emergency Planning and Community RighttoKnow Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act Many state and local environmental regulations exceed these federal regulations In the future there may be incremental legislation aimed at reduction of carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions and environmental restoration The Airport Noise and Capacity Act recognizes the rights of airport operators with noise problems to implement local noise abatement programs so long as they do not interfere unreasonably with interstate or foreign commerce or the national air transportation system Authorities in several cities have established aircraft noise reduction programs including the imposition of nighttime curfews We believe we have sufficient scheduling flexibility to accommodate local noise restrictions The impacts of carbon emissions generated by the airline industry and the impact of those emissions on climate change have faced increased scrutiny We committed to carbon neutral international growth starting in 2020 through our commitment to Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation a global marketbased emissions offset program issued by the International Civil Aviation Organization This does not have a direct impact on domestic flights however EPA is expected to finalize a rule in 2020 on aircraft emission standards which will align with the international agreements Over the course of several years we have transitioned to more fuelefficient aircraft fleets added fuelefficient winglets and flown efficient flight paths keeping with our industry commitments towards emission reduction In 2016 Alaska Airlines flew the first commercial flight in the US using a sustainable alternative jet fuel of a 20 blend made from forest residuals The fuel from that flight was produced by the Northwest Advanced Renewables Alliance NARA led by Washington State University Alaska Airlines has joined with others at Seattle Tacoma International Airport and San Francisco International 17 Airport to strengthen the pathway to commercially viable sustainable aviation fuel and through a partnership with Neste continues to assess the increased use of biofuels as an alternative fuel to reduce carbon dioxide emissions In addition Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air continue to utilize electric equipment at airports when we have the infrastructure to support it Overall the total Alaska mainline Greenhouse Gas emissions and intensity trend has decreased since 2009 and future goals have been set to continue reducing emissions intensity More broadly we know that being responsible for our impact is a critical part of delivering value for all those who depend on us  employees communities guests and owners  over the long term To that end we focused on addressing the breadth of our most significant environmental impact across emissions and waste as well as important social impacts Alaska Airlines leads the industry in inflight recycling and has reduced waste to landfill by over 15000 tons over the past decade In 2018 we were the first US airlines to remove plastic straws and stir sticks from our aircraft and in 2019 we launched a campaign called FillBeforeYouFly to engage our employees and guests in reducing plastic waste For more details on Alaskas emission reductions programs as well as status on other key environmental initiatives see

annual report on Form 10K Although we do not currently anticipate that specific environmental regulation will have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows new regulations or compliance issues that we do not currently anticipate could have the potential to harm our financial condition results of operations or cash flows in future periods INSURANCE We carry insurance of types customary in the airline industry and in amounts deemed adequate to protect our interests and property and to comply both with federal regulations and certain credit and lease agreements The insurance policies principally provide coverage for Airline Hull Spares and Comprehensive Legal Liability War and Allied Perils and Workers Compensation In addition we currently carry a Cyber Insurance policy in the event of security breaches from malicious parties We believe that our emphasis on safety and our stateoftheart flight deck safety technology help to control the cost of our insurance WHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION Our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission including our annual report on Form 10K quarterly reports on Form 10Q current reports on Form

stock could also decline We operate in a continually changing business environment In this environment new risks may emerge and already identified risks may vary significantly in terms of impact and likelihood of occurrence Management cannot predict such developments nor can it assess the impact if any on our business of such new risk factors or of events described in any forwardlooking statements We have adopted an enterprisewide risk analysis and oversight program designed to identify the various risks faced by the organization assign responsibility for managing those risks to individual executives as well as align these risks with Board oversight These enterprisewide risks have been aligned to the risk factors discussed below 19 SAFETY COMPLIANCE AND OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE Our reputation and financial results could be harmed in the event of an airline accident or incident An accident or incident involving one of our aircraft or an aircraft operated by one of our codeshare partners or CPA carriers could involve loss of life and result in a loss of confidence in our Company by the flying public andor aviation authorities We could experience significant claims from injured passengers bystanders and surviving relatives as well as costs for the repair or replacement of a damaged aircraft and temporary or permanent loss from service We maintain liability insurance in amounts and of the type generally consistent with industry practice as do our codeshare partners and CPA carriers However the amount of such coverage may not be adequate to fully cover all claims and we may be forced to bear substantial economic losses from such an event Substantial claims resulting from an accident in excess of our related insurance coverage would harm our business and financial results Moreover any aircraft accident or incident even if it is fully insured and does not involve one of our aircraft could cause a public perception that our airlines or the aircraft we or our partners fly are less safe or reliable than other transportation alternatives This would harm our business Our operations are often affected by factors beyond our control including delays cancellations and other conditions which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations As is the case for all airlines our operations often are affected by delays cancellations and other conditions caused by factors largely beyond our control Factors that might impact our operations include  congestion construction andor space constraints at airports specifically in our hub locations of Seattle Los Angeles and San Francisco  air traffic control problems  adverse weather conditions  lack of operational approval eg new routes aircraft deliveries etc  increased security measures or breaches in security  contagious illness and fear of contagion  changes in international treaties concerning air rights  international or domestic conflicts or terrorist activity and  other changes in business conditions Due to our concentration of flights in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska we believe a large portion of our operation is more susceptible to adverse weather conditions than other carriers A general reduction in airline passenger traffic as a result of any of the abovementioned factors could harm our business financial condition and results of operations Changes in government regulation imposing additional requirements and restrictions on our operations could increase our operating costs and result in service delays and disruptions Airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal requirements both domestically and internationally that require substantial compliance costs In the last several years Congress has passed laws and the US DOT the TSA and the FAA have issued regulations that have required significant expenditures relating to maintenance of aircraft operation of airlines and broadening of consumer protections Similarly there are a number of legislative and regulatory initiatives and reforms at the federal state and local levels These initiatives include increasingly stringent laws to protect the environment minimum wage requirements mandatory paid sick or family leave and health care mandates These laws could affect our relationship with our workforce and the vendors that serve our airlines and cause our expenses to increase without an ability to pass through these costs New initiatives with employerfunded costs specifically those impacting Washington State could disproportionately increase our cost structure as compared 20 to our competitors In recent years the airline industry has experienced an increase in litigation over the application of state and local employment laws particularly in California Application of these laws may result in operational disruption increased litigation risk and impact on negotiated labor agreements Almost all commercial service airports are owned andor operated by units of local or state governments Airlines are largely dependent on these governmental entities to provide adequate airport facilities and capacity at an affordable cost Many airports have increased their rates and charges to air carriers to reflect higher costs of security updates to infrastructure and other Additional laws regulations taxes airport rates and airport charges may be occasionally proposed that could significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce the demand for air travel Although lawmakers may impose these additional fees and view them as passthrough costs we believe that a higher total ticket price will influence consumer purchase and travel decisions and may result in an overall decline in passenger traffic which would harm our business Additionally changes in laws and regulations at the local level may be difficult to track and maintain compliance Any instances of noncompliance could result in additional fines and fees The airline industry continues to face potential security concerns and related costs Terrorist attacks the fear of such attacks or other hostilities involving the US could have a significant negative effect on the airline industry including us and could  significantly reduce passenger traffic and yields as a result of a dramatic drop in demand for air travel  significantly increase security and insurance costs  make war risk or other insurance unavailable or extremely expensive  increase fuel costs and the volatility of fuel prices  increase costs from airport shutdowns flight cancellations and delays resulting from security breaches and perceived safety threats and  result in a grounding of commercial air traffic by the FAA The occurrence of any of these events would harm our business financial condition and results of operations We rely on thirdparty vendors for certain critical activities which could expose us to disruptions in our operation or unexpected cost increases We rely on outside vendors for a variety of services and functions critical to our business including airframe and engine maintenance regional flying ground handling fueling computer reservation system hosting telecommunication systems information technology infrastructure and services and deicing among others Even though we strive to formalize agreements with these vendors that define expected service levels our use of outside vendors increases our exposure to several risks In the event that one or more vendors go into bankruptcy ceases operation or fails to perform as promised replacement services may not be readily available at competitive rates or at all If one of our vendors fails to perform adequately we may experience increased costs delays maintenance issues safety issues or negative public perception of our airline Vendor bankruptcies unionization regulatory compliance issues or significant changes in the competitive marketplace among suppliers could adversely affect vendor services or force us to renegotiate existing agreements on less favorable terms These events could result in disruptions in our operations or increases in our cost structure Operation of a multiaircraft type fleet may present standardization and training challenges We strive for operational efficiency which has historically been aided by our operation of a single aircraft type fleet at each operating company With our acquisition of Virgin America we added additional aircraft types to our mainline fleet Certain procedures and training remain to be completed in order to ensure standardized operations for our crews and technicians as well as a seamless experience for our guests Any failure to complete these procedures and training may create adverse impacts on guests employees and our ability to run an operationally efficient airline 21 STRATEGY The airline industry is highly competitive and susceptible to price discounting and changes in capacity which could have a material adverse effect on our business If we cannot successfully compete in the marketplace our business financial condition and operating results will be materially adversely affected The US airline industry is characterized by substantial price competition In recent years the market share held by lowcost carriers and ultra lowcost carriers has increased significantly and is expected to continue to increase Airlines also compete for market share by increasing or decreasing their capacity route systems and the number of markets served Several of our competitors have increased their capacity in markets we serve particularly in our key West Coast markets The resulting increased competition in both domestic and international markets may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition or liquidity We strive toward maintaining and improving our competitive cost structure by setting aggressive unit costreduction goals This is an important part of our business strategy of offering the best value to our guests through low fares while achieving acceptable profit margins and return on capital If we are unable to maintain our cost advantage over the longterm and achieve sustained targeted returns on invested capital we will likely not be able to grow our business in the future or weather industry downturns Therefore our financial results may suffer The airline industry may undergo further restructuring consolidation or the creation or modification of alliances or joint ventures any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations We continue to face strong competition from other carriers due to restructuring consolidation and the creation and modification of alliances and joint ventures Since deregulation both the US and international airline industries have experienced consolidation through a number of mergers and acquisitions Carriers may also improve their competitive positions through airline alliances slot swapsacquisitions andor joint ventures Certain airline joint ventures further competition by allowing airlines to coordinate routes pool revenues and costs and enjoy other mutual benefits achieving many of the benefits of consolidation Our concentration in certain markets could cause us to be disproportionately impacted by adverse changes in circumstances in those locations Our strategy includes being the premier carrier for people living on the West Coast This results in a high concentration of our business in key West Coast markets A significant portion of our flights occur to and from our Seattle Portland and Bay Area hubs In 2019 passengers to and from Seattle Portland and the Bay Area accounted for 83 of our total guests We believe that concentrating our service offerings in this way allows us to maximize our investment in personnel aircraft and ground facilities as well as to gain greater advantage from sales and marketing efforts in those regions As a result we remain highly dependent on our key markets Our business could be harmed by any circumstances causing a reduction in demand for air transportation in our key markets An increase in competition in our key markets could also cause us to reduce fares or take other competitive measures that if sustained could harm our business financial condition and results of operations We are dependent on a limited number of suppliers for aircraft and parts Alaska is dependent on Boeing and Airbus as its sole suppliers for aircraft and many aircraft parts Horizon is similarly dependent on De Havilland and Embraer Additionally each carrier is dependent on sole suppliers for aircraft engines for each aircraft type As a result we are more vulnerable to issues associated with the supply of those aircraft and parts including design defects mechanical problems contractual performance by the manufacturers or adverse perception by the public that would result in customer avoidance or in actions by the FAA Should we be unable to resolve known issues with certain of our aircraft or engine suppliers it may result in the inability to operate our aircraft for extended periods Should these suppliers be unable to manufacture or deliver new aircraft we may not be able to grow our fleet at our intended rate which could impact our financial position Specifically the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft was grounded by the FAA in March 2019 and remains grounded We have 32 MAX9 aircraft on order with 10 aircraft deliveries currently anticipated in 2020 If we are unable to receive these aircraft and future aircraft in a timely manner our growth plans could be significantly impacted Additionally further consolidation amongst aircraft and aircraft parts manufacturers could further limit the number of suppliers This could result in an inability to operate our aircraft or instability in the foreign countries in which the aircraft and its parts are manufactured 22 We rely on partner airlines for codeshare and frequent flyer marketing arrangements Our airlines are parties to marketing agreements with a number of domestic and international air carriers or partners These agreements provide that certain flight segments operated by us are held out as partner codeshare flights and that certain partner flights are held out for sale as Alaska codeshare flights In addition the agreements generally provide that members of Alaskas Mileage Plan program can earn credit on or redeem credit for partner flights and vice versa We receive revenue from flights sold under codeshare and from interline arrangements In addition we believe that the frequent flyer arrangements are an important part of our frequent flyer program The loss of a significant partner through bankruptcy consolidation or otherwise could have a negative effect on our revenues or the attractiveness of our Mileage Plan program which we believe is a source of competitive advantage We routinely engage in analysis and discussions regarding our own strategic position including alliances codeshare arrangements interline arrangements and frequent flyer program enhancements and will continue to have future discussions with other airlines regarding similar activities If other airlines participate in consolidation or reorganization those airlines may significantly improve their cost structures or revenue generation capabilities thereby potentially making them stronger competitors of ours and potentially impairing our ability to realize expected benefits from our own strategic relationships Economic uncertainty or another recession would likely impact demand for our product and could harm our financial condition and results of operations The airline industry which is subject to relatively high fixed costs and highly variable and unpredictable demand is particularly sensitive to changes in economic conditions We are also highly dependent on US consumer confidence and the health of the US economy Unfavorable US economic conditions have historically driven changes in travel patterns and have resulted in reduced spending for both leisure and business travel For some consumers leisure travel is a discretionary expense and shorter distance travelers in particular have the option to replace air travel with surface travel Businesses are able to forgo air travel by using communication alternatives such as videoconferencing or may be more likely to purchase less expensive tickets to reduce costs which can result in a decrease in average revenue per seat Unfavorable economic conditions also hamper the ability of airlines to raise fares to counteract increased fuel labor and other costs Unfavorable or even uncertain economic conditions could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY We rely heavily on automated systems to operate our business and a failure to invest in new technology or a disruption of our current systems or their operators could harm our business We depend on automated systems to operate our business including our airline reservation system our telecommunication systems our website our maintenance systems our checkin kiosks mobile devices and other systems Substantially all of our tickets are issued to our guests as electronic tickets and the majority of our guests checkin using our website airport kiosks or our mobile application We depend on our reservation system to be able to issue track and accept these electronic tickets In order for our operations to work efficiently we must continue to invest in new technology to ensure that our website reservation system and checkin systems are able to accommodate a high volume of traffic maintain information security and deliver important flight information Substantial or repeated website reservations system or telecommunication systems failures or service disruptions could reduce the attractiveness of our services and cause our guests to do business with another airline In addition we rely on other automated systems for crew scheduling flight dispatch and other operational needs We are in the final stages of moving our primary data facility Disruptions failed migration untimely recovery or a breach of these systems or the data center could result in the loss of important data an increase of our expenses an impact on our operational performance or a possible temporary cessation of our operations 23 Failure to appropriately comply with information security rules and regulations or safeguard our employee or guest data could result in damage to our reputation and cause us to incur substantial legal and regulatory cost We accept store and transmit information about our guests our employees our business partners and our business Many international and US jurisdictions have established or are in the process of establishing their own data security and privacy regulatory framework with which we our business partners and our corporate customers must comply There are also various bills pending at the US state and federal levels that could impose additional privacy and data security obligations This uncertain and increasingly complex regulatory environment may result in significant expenses associated with increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes particularly as we continue to collect and retain large amounts of personal information If our online activities or our other customerfacing technology systems do not function as designed we may experience a loss of customer confidence decreased sales or be exposed to fraud any of which could materially and adversely affect our reputation and operations In addition we frequently rely on thirdparty hosting sites and data processors including cloud providers To the extent that either we or third parties with whom we share information are found to be out of compliance with applicable laws and regulations we could be subject to additional litigation regulatory risks and reputational harm Cyber security threats have and will continue to impact our business Failure to appropriately mitigate these risks could negatively impact our operations reputation and financial condition Our sensitive information is securely transmitted over public and private networks Our systems are subject to increasing and evolving cyber security risks Unauthorized parties have attempted and continue to attempt to gain access to our systems and information including through fraudulent misrepresentation and other means of deception Methods used by unauthorized parties are continually evolving and may be difficult to identify Because of these everevolving risks and regular attacks we continue to review policies and educate our people on various methods utilized in attempts to gain unauthorized access to bolster awareness and encourage cautionary practices However the nature of these attacks means that proper policies and education may not be enough to prevent all unauthorized access A compromise of our systems the security of our infrastructure or those of other business partners that result in our information being accessed or stolen by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our operations and our reputation FINANCIAL CONDITION AND FINANCIAL MARKETS Our business financial condition and results of operations are substantially exposed to the volatility of jet fuel prices Significant increases in jet fuel costs would harm our business Fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our total operating expenses Future increases in the price of jet fuel may harm our business financial condition and results of operations unless we are able to increase fares and fees or add additional ancillary services to attempt to recover increasing fuel costs Our indebtedness and other fixed obligations could lead to liquidity constraints that may restrict our activities We carry and will continue to carry for the foreseeable future a substantial amount of debt related to aircraft lease and financing commitments Although we aim to keep our leverage low due to our high fixed costs including such aircraft lease commitments and debt service a decrease in revenues would result in a disproportionately greater decrease in earnings Our outstanding longterm debt and other fixed obligations could have important consequences For example they could limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our future capital expenditures working capital or other purposes require us to dedicate a material portion of our operating cash flow to fund lease payments and interest payments on indebtedness thereby reducing funds available for other purposes or limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions Although we have historically been able to generate sufficient cash flow from our operations to pay our debt and other fixed obligations when they become due we cannot ensure we will be able to do so in the future If we fail to do so our business could be harmed 24 Our maintenance costs will increase as our fleet ages and we will periodically incur substantial maintenance costs due to the timing of maintenance events of our aircraft As of December 31 2019 the average age of our NextGen aircraft B737700 800 900 900ERs was approximately 89 years the average age of our A319 A320 and A321neo aircraft was approximately 86 years the average age of our owned E175 aircraft was approximately 16 years and the average age of our Q400 aircraft was approximately 117 years Currently our newer aircraft require less maintenance than they will in the future Any significant increase in maintenance expenses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations In addition expenses for aircraft coming off lease could result in unplanned maintenance expense as we are required to return the leased planes in a contractually specified condition The application of the acquisition method of accounting resulted in us recording a significant amount of goodwill which could result in significant future impairment charges and negatively affect our financial results In accordance with acquisition accounting rules we recorded goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet to the extent the Virgin America acquisition purchase price exceeded the net fair value of Virgin Americas tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually We could record impairment charges in our results of operations as a result of among other items extreme fuel price volatility a significant decline in the fair value of certain tangible or intangible assets unfavorable trends in forecasted results of operations and cash flows uncertain economic environment and other uncertainties We can provide no assurance that a significant impairment charge will not occur in one or more future periods Any such charges may materially negatively affect our financial results BRAND AND REPUTATION As we evolve our brand to appeal to a changing demographic and grow into new markets we will engage in strategic initiatives that may not be favorably received by all of our guests We continue to focus on strategic initiatives designed to increase our brand appeal to a diverse and evolving demographic of airline travelers These efforts could include significant enhancements to our inairport and onboard environments increasing our direct customer relationships through improvements to our purchasing portals digital and mobile and optimization of our customer loyalty programs In pursuit of these efforts we may negatively affect our reputation with some of our existing customer base The Companys brand and reputation could be harmed if it is exposed to significant negative publicity distributed through social media We operate in a highly visible industry that has significant exposure to social media Negative publicity including as a result of misconduct by our guests or employees can spread rapidly through social media Should the Company not respond in a timely and appropriate manner to address negative publicity the Companys brand and reputation may be significantly harmed Such harm could have a negative impact on our financial results LABOR RELATIONS AND LABOR STRATEGY A significant increase in labor costs unsuccessful attempts to strengthen our relationships with union employees or loss of key personnel could adversely affect our business and results of operations Labor costs remain a significant component of our total expenses In addition to costs associated with represented employee groups labors costs could also increase for nonunionized employees and via vendor agreements as we work to compete for highly skilled and qualified employees against the major US airlines and other businesses in a thriving job market Although ample efforts have been dedicated to rightsizing our management structure following the merger with Virgin America these increased labor costs may adversely affect our financial performance Should employees engage in job actions such as slowdowns sickouts or other actions designed to disrupt normal operations and pressure the employer to acquiesce to bargaining demands during Section 6 negotiations although unlawful until after lengthy mediation attempts the operation could be significantly impacted Although we have a long track record of fostering good communications negotiating approaches and developing other strategies to enhance workforce engagement in our longterm vision unsuccessful attempts to strengthen relationships with union employees or loss of key personnel could divert managements attention from other projects and issues which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 25 The inability to attract retain and train qualified personnel or maintain our culture could result in guest impacts and adversely affect our business and results of operations We compete against other major US airlines for pilots aircraft technicians and other skilled labor As more pilots in the industry approach mandatory retirement age the US airline industry may be affected by a pilot shortage Attrition beyond normal levels the inability to attract new pilots or our key vendors inability to attract and retain mechanics or other skilled labor positions could negatively impact our operating results As a result our business prospects could be harmed Additionally we may be required to increase our wage and benefit packages or pay increased rates to our vendors to retain these positions This would result in increased overall costs and may adversely impact our financial position Our success is also dependent on cultivating and maintaining a united culture with cohesive values and goals Much of our continued success is tied to our guest loyalty Failure to maintain and grow the Alaska culture could strain our ability to maintain relationships with guests suppliers employees and other constituencies As part of this process we may continue to incur substantial costs for employee programs ITEM 1B UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None ITEM 2 PROPERTIES AIRCRAFT The following table describes the aircraft we operate and their average age at December 31 2019 Aircraft Type Seats

E175 aircraft are through our capacity purchase agreement with SkyWest which extends through 2030 Alaska has the option to extend some of the leases for additional periods GROUND FACILITIES AND SERVICES In various cities in the state of Alaska we own terminal buildings and two multibay hangars We also own several buildings located at or near SeattleTacoma International Airport SeaTac These include a multibay hangar and shops complex used primarily for line maintenance a flight operations and training center an air cargo facility an information technology office and data center and various other commercial office buildings Additionally in 2018 we began developing a property near our existing headquarters facility for additional office space 26 At the majority of the airports we serve we lease ticket counters gates cargo and baggage space ground equipment office space and other support areas Airport leases contain provisions for periodic adjustments of lease rates We are typically responsible for maintenance insurance and other facilityrelated expenses and services under these agreements We also lease operations training administrative and data center facilities in Burlingame CA Portland OR Quincy WA and Spokane WA line maintenance stations in Boise ID San Jose CA Redmond OR Seattle WA Kent WA and Spokane WA and call center facilities in Phoenix AZ Boise ID and Kent WA and a multibay hangar in Portland OR ITEM 3 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS We are a party to routine litigation matters incidental to our business Management believes the ultimate disposition of these matters is not likely to materially affect our financial position or results of operations This forwardlooking statement is based on managements current understanding of the relevant law and facts and it is subject to various contingencies including the potential costs and risks associated with litigation and the actions of judges and juries In 2015 three flight attendants filed a class action lawsuit seeking to represent all Virgin America flight attendants for damages based on alleged violations of California and City of San Francisco wage and hour laws The court certified a class of approximately 1800 flight attendants in November 2016 The Company believes the claims in this case are without factual and legal merit In July 2018 the Court granted in part Plaintiffs motion for summary judgment finding Virgin America and Alaska Airlines as a successorininterest to Virgin America responsible for various damages and penalties sought by the class members On February 4 2019 the Court entered final judgment against Virgin America and Alaska Airlines in the amount of approximately 78 million It did not award injunctive relief against Alaska Airlines The Company is seeking an appellate court ruling that the California laws on which the judgment is based are invalid as applied to national airlines pursuant to the US Constitution and federal law and for other employment law and improper class certification reasons The Company remains confident that a higher court will respect the federal preemption principles that were enacted to shield interstate common carriers from a patchwork of state and local wage and hour regulations such as those at issue in this case and agree with the Companys other bases for appeal For these reasons no loss has been accrued The Company is involved in other litigation around the application of state and local employment laws like many air carriers Our defenses are similar to those identified above including that the state and local laws are preempted by federal law and are unconstitutional because they impede interstate commerce None of these additional disputes are material ITEM 4 MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES Not applicable PART II
