PART I ITEM 1 OUR BUSINESS Air Group operates Alaska Virgin America and Horizon Air We completed the acquisition of Virgin America on December 14 2016 at which time Virgin America became our whollyowned subsidiary Together with our regional partner airlines we fly to 118 destinations with nearly 1200 daily departures through our expansive network across the United States Mexico Canada Costa Rica and Cuba With our global airline partners we can provide our guests with a virtual network of more than 900 destinations worldwide During 2016  we carried an alltime high 34 million guests and earned adjusted net income of 911 million  which includes operating and financial results for Virgin America for the period December 14 2016 through December 31 2016 and excludes pretax special items and mergerrelated costs of  117 million  Our acquisition of Virgin America positions us as the fifth largest airline in the US with an unparalleled ability to serve West Coast travelers Virgin America provides a platform for growth of our lowfare premium product providing a powerful West Coast network for our guests as well as enhanced international partnerships Additionally Virgin America provides an opportunity to grow and improve our loyalty program while gaining access to constrained gates particularly on the East Coast The combined company now provides more seats from the West Coast than any other carrier allowing us to serve our guests better Our mission is creating an airline people love The ing is to recognize we are never done  we are continually working to get better We believe our success depends on our ability to provide safe air transportation develop relationships with guests by providing exceptional customer service and low fares and maintain a low cost structure to compete effectively It is important to us that we achieve our objective as a socially responsible company that values not just our performance but also our people our community and our environment While aircraft and technology enable us to provide air transportation we recognize this is fundamentally a people business Our employees maintain and strengthen our relationships with guests and our success depends on our employees working together to successfully execute our strategy In 2016 Alaska was once again named one of Americas Best Employers by Forbes Magazine We know that engaged employees provide excellent service In that vein in 2016  Alaska ranked highest in customer satisfaction among traditional network carriers by JD Power and Associates for the ninth year in a row and Virgin America was recognized for excellent service by Conde Nast Traveler and Travel  Leisure magazine also for the ninth year in a row Customer service matters and we believe the combination of our airlines will only enhance the experience for our guests Operationally Alaska has held the No 1 spot in the Wall Street Journals Middle Seat scorecard for US airlines for four consecutive years We have been the leader in the industry for ontime performance among major airlines for the past seven years For achieving safety customer service operational and financial goals we rewarded our employees with a record 127 million in incentive pay during 2016  Including incentives earned during the year prior to the acquisition by Virgin America employees the total is 159 million  In support of the communities that we serve we strive to be an industry leader in environmental and community stewardship In 2016  we improved fuel efficiency by 14 from the prior year as measured by available seat miles flown per gallon We also flew the first two commercial flights using sustainable alcoholtojet biofuel made from US grown corn and alternative jet fuel made from forest residuals highlighting our commitment to environmental stewardship Our combined fleet is one of the youngest most fuelefficient fleets in North America and we look forward to further enhancements in this area Air Group donated 13 million to over 1300 charitable organizations and our employees volunteered more than 27000 hours of community service Virgin America has also been active in community service and charitable giving Our efforts focus on youth and education medical research and transportation and community outreach One of our leadership principals is to give back and we are proud of the efforts and volunteerism of our employees across the system We earned record financial results in 2016  marking our 13th consecutive annual profit on an adjusted basis We achieved an aftertax return on invested capital of 213  well above our weighted average cost of capital Although we incurred a significant amount of new debt in 2016 to fund the Virgin America acquisition our liquidity and capital position still remain strong and are among those of highquality industrial companies Due to our strong financial health and outlook we are one of only three US airlines with investment grade credit ratings With the cash generated by the continued success we have had in the past decade we have been able to invest in our business to achieve profitable growth and to enhance the customer experience Most recently we launched our Premium Class service on our Boeing 737 aircraft which includes more legroom early boarding free cocktails and premium snacks 4 As we look to the future we will build on our success by executing our strategic plan in the following areas Be Safe and On time We have an unwavering commitment to run a safe and compliant operation and we will not compromise this commitment in the pursuit of other initiatives Alaska and Horizon were the first US major airlines to receive Federal Aviation Administration FAA validation and acceptance of our Safety Management System SMS in the third quarter of 2016 SMS helps identify and manage risk and builds a sustainable culture of safety for Air Group employees We have an initiative to add Virgin America to the SMS program in 2017 Once again for 2016 100 of our Alaska and Horizon aircraft technicians completed the requirements for the FAAs Diamond Certificate of Excellence award This is the 15th consecutive year Alaska Airlines has received the award and the 15th time in the last 17 years for Horizon We also believe that maintaining safe and compliant operations through adherence to well defined processes and ensuring every Air Group employee is aware of their individual contribution to our operation is critical to ensuring ontime performance The rigor we apply to running a safe and compliant operation has resulted in Alaska being named the No 1 ontime carrier in North America for the seventh year in a row by FlightStats Focus on People Our success depends on our people Higher employee engagement drives higher productivity superior execution and better customer service which is why we listen to our employees for feedback in shaping our strategy Employee engagement scores from our annual employee survey are at historical highs We have designed customerservice workshops and leadership training that cover virtually all employees and do these on an ongoing basis As we integrate Alaska and Virgin America in January 2017 we rolled out Momentum training for all Virgin America employees to help bridge the two airlines and blend our cultures For our Horizon employees we are conducting QX Factor a program with the goal of improving culture engagement and communication We understand that aligning our employees goals with Air Groups goals is important in achieving success The majority of Air Group employees including Virgin America employees starting in 2017 participate in our PerformanceBased Pay PBP and Operational Performance Rewards OPR programs which encourage employees to work together to achieve metrics related to safety profitability ontime performance low costs and customer loyalty and satisfaction Over the last five years our incentive programs have paid out on average over 87 of annual pay or more than one months pay for most employees Build a deep emotional connection for our brand We want to be recognized as the preferred airline to fly for people living on the West Coast In January 2016 we introduced a bold new brand expression including an updated identity livery and look and feel for our digital and physical experiences In January 2017 subsequent to year end we were the first airline to launch Free Chat  a feature that allows our guests to text for free inflight We believe there is an opportunity to deepen the emotional connection with our guests as we continue to expand and grow Our updated brand expression draws upon our rich heritage while infusing it with additional warmth and energy to better reflect how guests feel about our brand and the great service that we pride ourselves in delivering We continue to invest in a better customer experience Onboard guests will continue to enjoy more of what they love with free and premium entertainment direct to their devices Pacific Northwestinspired food and beverages custom leather seats with power outlets at every seat and larger overhead bins for carryon bags As mentioned previously we have also recently launched our new Premium Class section in the main cabin with increased legroom and other amenities and improved our First Class with five additional inches of leg room Defend and grow our customer base The merger with Virgin America provides an amazing opportunity for our new Alaska Air Group We have a network that provides unparalleled utility and options for our guests living on the West Coast Competition in our markets is fierce and we know we must defend our customer base as we use our combined network as an opportunity to grow that base We will be introducing new guests to our awardwinning service Mileage Plan program and affinity credit card as we grow our network Guests from our airlines already benefit from codeshare and reciprocal frequent flyer benefits including earning and redeeming rewards on both carriers Elite members of the Virgin America Elevate program and Alaskas Mileage Plan also receive priority boarding on both carriers We work hard to ensure our guests have a great experience on our airlines and are provided an exceptional product at a low fare 5 Win with low costs and low fares We believe that our lowfare model gives us a competitive advantage by providing value to and building trust with our guests We also know that in order to provide low fares in our growing network while returning value to our shareholders it is imperative for us to maintain a competitive cost structure In 2016  we lowered our unit costs excluding fuel by 08 on a consolidated basis representing the seventh consecutive year of annual reduction We achieved this through a continued focus on productivity cost management and by leveraging capacity growth We increased employee productivity in 2016 and will continue to focus on that metric as we grow We also manage fuel costs by flying larger more fuelefficient aircraft which have increased our fuel efficiency as measured by available seat miles flown per gallon by 70 over the last five years As we integrate Virgin America into our operations we are committed to achieving our stated cost and revenue synergy goals It is critical that we achieve these goals in order to continue our cost reduction efforts During fiscal 2016  we added 17 new markets to the combined network For 2017  we plan to grow our systemwide capacity approximately 85 as compared to the full year 2016 combined capacity of Air Group and Virgin America AIR GROUP Alaska Air Group is a Delaware corporation incorporated in 1985 and the holding company of Alaska Virgin America Horizon and other business units Although Alaska Virgin America and Horizon operate as airlines the business plans competition and economic risks differ substantially for Horizon in comparison to Alaska and Virgin America Alaska Airlines is an Alaska corporation that was organized in 1932 and incorporated in 1937 Virgin America is a California corporation that was incorporated in 2004 and acquired by Air Group on December 14 2016  Horizon is a Washington corporation that began service and was incorporated in 1981 It was acquired by Air Group in 1986 Alaska and Virgin America operate fleets of narrowbody passenger jets Together the operations of Alaska and Virgin America are referred to as mainline operations Alaska also contracts with Horizon SkyWest Airlines Inc SkyWest and Peninsula Airways Inc PenAir for regional capacity such that Alaska receives all passenger revenue from those flights Horizon currently operates a fleet of turboprop aircraft and sells all of its capacity to Alaska pursuant to a capacity purchase

Elevate Mileage Plan provides a comprehensive suite of frequent flyer benefits Miles can be earned by flying on Alaska or on one of our 24 airline partners by using the Alaska Airlines credit card or through other nonairline partners Our extensive list of airline partners includes carriers associated with each of the three major global alliances making it easier for our members to earn miles and reach elite status in our frequent flyer programs and have access to a large network of over 900 worldwide travel 7 destinations Further members can receive 30000 bonus miles upon signing up for the Alaska Airlines Visa Signature card and earn triple miles on purchases made on Alaska flights or on alaskaaircom Alaska Airlines Visa Signature cardholders also receive an annual companion ticket that allows members to purchase an additional ticket for 99 plus taxes with no restrictions or blackout dates and a free first checked bag for up to seven people traveling in the same itinerary Earned miles can be redeemed for flights on our airlines or on any of our partner airlines or for upgrades to First Class and Premium Class on Alaska Airlines All of these benefits give our Mileage Plan members more value for their travel on Alaska leading us to receive the highest ranking in customer satisfaction amongst traditional carriers in North America from JD Power and Associates for the last nine consecutive years Mileage Plan revenues represented approximately 12 of Air Groups total revenues in 2016 Mileage Plan helps drive revenue growth by attracting new customers and building customer loyalty through the benefits that we provide The Elevate program allows guests to earn points for purchasing travel that are redeemable for travel awards throughout our network and the networks of Virgin Americas airline partners Elevate members have been introduced to the Mileage Plan program and over time the two programs will become one Currently our guests from both airlines enjoy codeshare and reciprocal frequent flyer benefits including earning and redeeming rewards on both carriers Elite members of each frequent flyer program receive priority boarding on both carriers AGREEMENTS WITH OTHER AIRLINES Our agreements fall into three different categories Frequent Flyer Codeshare and Interline agreements Frequent Flyer agreements offer mileage credits and redemptions for our Mileage Plan and Elevate members Alaska offers one of the most comprehensive frequent flyer programs for our Mileage Plan members through our frequent flyer partnerships with 24 domestic and international carriers Codeshare agreements allow one or more marketing carriers to sell seats on a single operating carrier that services passengers under multiple flight numbers The sale of codeshare seats can vary depending on the sale arrangement For example in a freesale arrangement the marketing carrier sells the operating carriers inventory without any restriction whereas in a block space arrangement a fixed amount of seats is sold to the marketing carrier by the operating carrier The interchangeability of the flight code between carriers provides a greater selection of flights for customers along with increased flexibility for mileage accrual and redemption Interline agreements allow airlines to jointly offer a competitive singlefare itinerary to customers traveling via multiple carriers to a final destination An interline itinerary offered by one airline may not necessarily be offered by the other and the fares collected from passengers are prorated and distributed to interline partners according to preexisting agreements between the carriers Frequent flyer codeshare and interline agreements help increase our traffic and revenue by providing more route choices to our guests We have marketing alliances with a number of airlines that provide frequent flyer and codesharing opportunities Alliances are an important part of our strategy and enhance our revenues by  offering our guests more travel destinations and better mileage creditredemption opportunities including elite qualifying miles on all of our major US and international airline partners  giving our frequent flyer program a competitive advantage because of our partnership with carriers from all three of the major global alliances  giving us access to more connecting traffic from other airlines and  providing members of our alliance partners frequent flyer programs an opportunity to travel on Alaska Virgin America and our regional affiliates while earning mileage credit in our partners programs Most of our codeshare relationships are freesale codeshares where the marketing carrier sells seats on the operating carriers flights from the operating carriers inventory but takes no inventory risk Our marketing agreements have various termination dates and one or more may be in the process of renegotiation at any time On December 19 2016 we announced the termination of our codeshare agreement with Delta Air Lines Delta effective April 30 2017 Our interline agreement with Delta will continue We expect the impact to our guests in 2017 to be minimal due to growth in Alaskas own network in large part from our acquisition of Virgin America and our ability to codeshare with other 8 partners We also believe the financial exposure from the termination of our codeshare agreement with Delta will be immaterial to our financial results in 2017 The comprehensive summary of Alaska Horizon and SkyWest alliances with other airlines is as follows Codeshare Frequent Flyer Agreement Alaska Flight  on

December 31 2016 OTHER REVENUE Other revenue consists of freight and mail certain frequent flyer and ancillary revenue While some of our product features are included in our base pricing we have unbundled certain ancillary features that our guests separately value Major ancillary revenue products include checked bag fees change fees and lounge memberships We also promote and sell products inflight to enhance the guest experience including our Tom Douglas signature meals snacks alcoholic beverages inflight entertainment and WiFi Total other revenue excluding frequent flyer program revenue represents about 7 of our total revenues GENERAL The airline industry is highly competitive and subject to various uncertainties including economic conditions volatile fuel prices industry instability new competition a largely unionized work force the need to finance large capital expenditures and the related availability of capital government regulationincluding taxes and fees and potential aircraft incidents Airlines have high fixed costs primarily for wages aircraft fuel aircraft ownership and facilities rents Because expenses of a flight do not vary significantly based on the number of passengers carried a relatively small change in the number of passengers or in pricing has a disproportionate effect on an airlines operating and financial results In other words a minor shortfall in expected revenue levels could cause a disproportionately negative impact on our operating and financial results Passenger demand and ticket prices are to a large measure influenced by the general state of the economy current global economic and political events and total available airline seat capacity In 2016  the airline industry reported historically high revenues and profits as the global economy continued to recover and oil prices remained low As the industry strengthens airlines are now making significant investments in airports in new planes and in new services to differentiate their customer service offering Thus the level of competition is expected to increase FUEL Our business and financial results are highly affected by the price and the availability of aircraft fuel The cost of aircraft fuel is volatile and outside of our control and it can have a significant and immediate impact on our operating results Over the past five years aircraft fuel expense ranged from 18 to 35 of operating expenses Fuel prices are impacted by changes in both the price of crude oil and refining margins and can vary by region in the US The prices we have paid for crude oil on an average annual basis for the past five years have ranged from a low of 43 per barrel in 2016 to a high of 98 in 2013 For us a 1 per barrel change in the price of oil equates to approximately 18 million of fuel cost annually Said another way a onecent change in our fuel price per gallon will impact our expected annual fuel cost by approximately 7 million per year Refining margins which represent the price of refining crude oil into aircraft fuel are a smaller portion of the overall price of jet fuel but also contributed to the price volatility in recent years Average annual refining margin prices have fluctuated between 13 per barrel and 36 per barrel in the last five years and averaged 13 in 2016  10 Generally West Coast jet fuel prices are somewhat higher and more volatile than prices in the Gulf Coast or on the East Coast Our average raw fuel cost per gallon decreased 19 in 2016  39 in 2015 and 6 in 2014  The percentages of our aircraft fuel expense by crude oil and refining margins as well as the percentage of our aircraft fuel expense of operating expenses are as follows 2016 a 2015 2014 2013 2012 Crude oil 69  62  72  71  65  Refining margins 20

December 31 2016 b Other includes gains and losses on settled fuel hedges unrealized marktomarket fuel hedge gains or losses taxes and other intoplane costs We use crude oil call options as hedges to decrease our exposure to the volatility of jet fuel prices Historically we have had jet fuel refining margin swap contracts but we discontinued the use of the refining margin swaps in 2014 Call options effectively cap our pricing for crude oil limiting our exposure to increasing fuel prices for about half of our planned fuel consumption With call options we are hedged against spikes in crude oil prices and during a period of decline in crude oil prices we only forfeit cash previously paid for hedge premiums We begin hedging approximately 18 months in advance of crude oil consumption We believe that operating fuelefficient aircraft is the best hedge against high fuel prices Alaska operates an allBoeing 737 fleet Virgin America operates an allAirbus A320 family fleet and Horizon currently operates an allBombardier Q400 turboprop fleet Air Groups fuelefficiency rate expressed in available seat miles flown per gallon ASMsg improved from 745 ASMsg in 2012 to 797 ASMsg in 2016  These improvements have not only reduced our fuel consumption rate but also the amount of greenhouse gases and other pollutants that our aircraft emit COMPETITION Competition in the airline industry is intense and unpredictable Our competitors consist primarily of other airlines and to a lesser extent other forms of transportation Competition can be direct in the form of another carrier flying the exact nonstop route or indirect where a carrier serves the same two cities nonstop from an alternative airport in that city or via an itinerary requiring a connection at another airport We compete with other domestic airlines and a limited number of international airlines on nearly all of our scheduled routes Our largest competitor is Delta who has significantly increased their capacity in Seattle over the past few years Approximately 61 of our capacity to and from Seattle competes with Delta Based on schedules filed with the US Department of Transportation we expect the amount of competitive capacity overlap with all carriers to increase by more than 5 in the first half of 2017  weighted based on our network We believe that the following principal competitive factors are important to our guests  Safety record  Customer service and reputation We compete with other airlines in areas of customer service such as ontime performance guest amenitiesincluding first class and other premium seating quality of onboard products aircraft type and comfort In 2016  Alaska Airlines ranked highest in customer satisfaction among traditional network carriers by JD Power and Associates for the ninth year in a row In 2016 we began installing Boeing Space Bins on our Boeing 737900ER fleet providing additional overhead bin space for our guests In 2017 we are launching a Premium Class of service on our B737 aircraft that will provide extra legroom early boarding premium snacks and a complimentary alcoholic beverage Additionally in 2017 we are increasing the distance between seats in our first class cabins on the Alaska B737900 and B737900ER fleet providing significantly more space for guests flying in the first class cabin We expect to fully complete the first class cabin upgrades on the B737900 and B737900ER fleet in early 2018 11 Cabins of our Virgin America Airbus A320 family fleet have a distinctive appearance through innovative design and use of technology Every cabin features special mood lighting designed to create a calming lowstress environment for our guests custom leather seats tailored to provide comfort especially on our longhaul flights inflight wireless internet access and electrical power outlets adjacent to every seat All of our guests flying on Virgin America aircraft have access to the Red  inflight entertainment system that allows each guest to customize his or her inflight experience through a host of entertainment options ondemand food and beverage ordering system and a seattoseat chat function Our employees are a key element of our product We have a highly engaged workforce that strives to provide a high degree of service and hospitality to our guests both at the airport and in flight We heavily emphasize our service standards with our employees through training and education programs and monetary incentives related to operational performance and guest surveys  Fares and ancillary services The pricing of fares is a significant competitive factor in the airline industry and the increased availability of fare information on the Internet allows travelers to easily compare fares and identify competitor promotions and discounts Pricing is driven by a variety of factors including but not limited to marketspecific capacity market share per routegeographic area cost structure fare vs ancillary revenue strategies and demand For example airlines often discount fares to drive traffic in new markets or to stimulate traffic when necessary to improve load factors In addition traditional network carriers have been able to reduce their operating costs through bankruptcies and mergers while lowcost carriers have continued to grow their fleets and expand their networks potentially enabling them to better control costs per available seat mile the average cost to fly an aircraft seat one mile which in turn may enable them to lower their fares These factors can reduce our pricing power and that of the airline industry as a whole Domestic airline capacity is dominated by four large carriers representing approximately 82 of total seats Accordingly if these carriers discount their fares or enter into our core markets we must match those fares in order to maintain our load factors often resulting in yearoveryear decreases in our yields We will defend our core markets vigorously and if necessary redeploy capacity to better match supply with demand We believe the restructuring weve completed over the past decade has decreased our costs enabling us to offer competitive fares while still earning appropriate returns for our shareholders  Routes served flight schedules codesharing and interline relationships and frequent flyer programs We also compete with other airlines based on markets served the frequency of service to those markets and frequent flyer opportunities Some airlines have more extensive route structures than we do and they offer significantly more international routes In order to expand opportunities for our guests we enter into codesharing and interline relationships with other airlines that provide reciprocal frequent flyer mileage credit and redemption privileges These relationships allow us to offer our guests access to more destinations than we can on our own gain exposure in markets we dont serve and allow our guests more opportunities to earn and redeem frequent flyer miles Our frequent flyer programs offer some of the most comprehensive benefits to our members with the ability to earn and redeem miles on 24 of our partner carriers In addition to domestic or foreign airlines that we compete with on most of our routes we compete with ground transportation in our shorthaul markets Our airlines to some extent also compete with technology such as video conferencing and internetbased meeting tools that have changed the need for or frequency of facetoface business meetings TICKET DISTRIBUTION Our tickets are distributed through three primary channels  Direct to customer It is less expensive for us to sell through our direct channels at alaskaaircom and virginamericacom As a result we continue to take steps to drive more business to our websites In addition we believe this channel is preferable from a branding and customerrelationship standpoint in that we can establish ongoing communication with the customer and tailor offers accordingly  Traditional and online travel agencies Both traditional and online travel agencies typically use Global Distribution Systems GDS to obtain their fare and inventory data from airlines Bookings made through these agencies result in a fee that is charged to the airline Many of our large corporate customers require us to use these agencies Some of our competitors do not use this distribution channel and as a result have lower ticket distribution costs 12  Reservation call centers The Alaska call centers are located in Phoenix AZ Kent WA and Boise ID Virgin America uses an outsourced call center We generally charge a 15 fee for booking reservations through the Alaska call centers and 20 for booking reservations through the Virgin America call centers We plan on combining the reservations call centers over the next several months as part of our integration efforts Our sales by channel are as follows 2016 a 2015 2014 2013 2012 Direct to customer 61  60  57  55  54

period December 14 2016 through December 31 2016 SEASONALITY AND OTHER FACTORS Our results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of those for the entire year because our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations Our profitability is generally lowest during the first and fourth quarters due principally to fewer departures and passengers Profitability typically increases in the second quarter and then reaches its highest level during the third quarter as a result of vacation travel including increased activity in the state of Alaska However we have significantly improved the seasonality of our operations by our continued growth from the West Coast to leisure destinations like Hawaii and Costa Rica and expanding to leisure and business destinations in the midcontinental and eastern US In addition to passenger loads factors that could cause our quarterly operating results to vary include  general economic conditions and resulting changes in passenger demand  changes in fuel costs  pricing initiatives by us or our competitors  increases in competition at our primary airports and  increases or decreases in passenger and volumedriven variable costs Many of the markets we serve experience inclement weather conditions in the winter causing increased costs associated with deicing aircraft canceling flights and accommodating displaced passengers Due to our geographic area of operations we can be more susceptible to adverse weather conditions particularly in the state of Alaska and the Pacific Northwest than some of our competitors who may be better able to spread weatherrelated risks over larger route systems We also are more susceptible to ground delays due to our heavy concentration of departures from San Francisco International Airport No material part of our business or that of our subsidiaries is dependent upon a single customer or upon a few highvolume customers EMPLOYEES Our business is labor intensive As of December 31 2016  we employed 19112  12224 at Alaska 3252 at Virgin America and 3636 at Horizon active fulltime and parttime employees Wages and benefits including variable incentive pay represented approximately 40 of our total nonfuel operating expenses in both 2016 and 2015  Most major airlines including Alaska and Horizon have employee groups that are covered by collective bargaining agreements Airlines with unionized work forces generally have higher labor costs than carriers without unionized work forces and they may not have the ability to adjust labor costs downward quickly enough to respond to new competition or slowing demand At December 31 2016  labor unions represented 84 of Alaskas and 43 of Horizons employees Inflight teammates our term for flight attendants at Virgin America and pilots at Virgin America voted to be represented by unions on 13 August 13 2014 and June 4 2015 respectively However as of December 31 2016 neither Virgin America work group had completed collective bargaining agreement negotiations Our relations with US labor organizations are governed by the Railway Labor Act RLA Under this act collective bargaining agreements do not expire but instead become amendable as of a stated date If either party wishes to modify the terms of any such agreement it must notify the other party in the manner prescribed by the RLA andor described in the agreement After receipt of such notice the parties must meet for direct negotiations and if no agreement is reached either party may request the National Mediation Board NMB to initiate a process including mediation arbitration and a potential cooling off period that must be followed before either party may engage in selfhelp Alaskas union contracts at December 31 2016 were

Group and Alaska Airlines in February 2014 REGULATION GENERAL The airline industry is highly regulated most notably by the federal government The Department of Transportation DOT the Federal Aviation Administration FAA and the Transportation Security Administration TSA exercise significant regulatory authority over air carriers  DOT In order to provide passenger and cargo air transportation in the US a domestic airline is required to hold a certificate of public convenience and necessity issued by the DOT Subject to certain individual airport capacity noise and other restrictions this certificate permits an air carrier to operate between any two points in the US Certificates do not expire but may be revoked for failure to comply with federal aviation statutes regulations orders or the terms of the certificates While airlines are permitted to establish their own fares without government regulation the DOT has jurisdiction over the approval of international codeshare agreements marketing alliance agreements between major domestic carriers international and some domestic route authorities Essential Air Service market subsidies carrier liability for personal or property damage and certain airport rates and charges disputes International treaties may also contain restrictions or requirements for flying outside of the US and impose different carrier liability limits than those applicable to domestic flights The DOT has been active in implementing a variety of consumer protection regulations covering subjects such as advertising passenger communications denied boarding compensation and tarmac delay response Airlines are subject to enforcement actions that are brought by the DOT from time to time for alleged violations of consumer protection and other economic regulations We are not aware of any enforcement proceedings that could either materially affect our financial position or impact our authority to operate  FAA The FAA through Federal Aviation Regulations FARs generally regulates all aspects of airline operations including establishing personnel maintenance and flight operation standards Domestic airlines are required to hold a valid air carrier operating certificate issued by the FAA Pursuant to these regulations we have established and the FAA has approved our operations specifications and a maintenance program for each type of aircraft we operate Each maintenance program provides for the ongoing maintenance of the relevant aircraft type ranging from frequent routine inspections to major overhauls From time to time the FAA issues airworthiness directives ADs that must be incorporated into our aircraft maintenance program and operations All airlines are subject to enforcement actions that are brought by the FAA from time to time for alleged violations of FARs or ADs At this time we are not aware of any enforcement proceedings that could either materially affect our financial position or impact our authority to operate  TSA Airlines serving the US must operate a TSAapproved Aircraft Operator Standard Security Program AOSSP and comply with TSA Security Directives SDs and regulations Under TSA authority we are required to collect a September 11 Security Fee of 560 per oneway trip from passengers and remit that sum to the government to fund aviation security me asures Airlines are subject to enforcement actions that are brought by the TSA from time to time for alleged violations of the AOSSP SDs or security regulations We are not aware of any enforcement proceedings that could either materially affect our financial position or impact our authority to operate The Department of Justice and DOT have jurisdiction over airline antitrust matters The US Postal Service has jurisdiction over certain aspects of the transportation of mail and related services Labor relations in the air transportation industry are regulated under the Railway Labor Act To the extent we continue to fly to foreign countries and pursue alliances with international carriers we may be subject to certain regulations of foreign agencies and international treaties 16 ENVIRONMENTAL AND OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY MATTERS We are subject to various laws and government regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the US and other countries US federal laws that have a particular effect on us include the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 the Clean Air Act the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act the Clean Water Act the Safe Drinking Water Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act and the Oil Pollution Control Act We are also subject to the oversight of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration OSHA concerning employee safety and health matters The US Environmental Protection Agency OSHA and other federal agencies have been authorized to create and enforce regulations that have an impact on our operations In addition to these federal activities various states have been delegated certain authorities under these federal statutes Many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations We maintain our safety health and environmental programs in order to meet or exceed these requirements We believe there may be local or federal legislation in the future to reduce carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions Over the course of several years we have transitioned to more fuelefficient aircraft fleets and reduced our emissions with the goal of continuing that trend The Airport Noise and Capacity Act recognizes the rights of airport operators with noise problems to implement local noise abatement programs so long as they do not interfere unreasonably with interstate or foreign commerce or the national air transportation system Authorities in several cities have established aircraft noise reduction programs including the imposition of nighttime curfews We believe we have sufficient scheduling flexibility to accommodate local noise restrictions Although we do not currently anticipate that these regulatory matters individually or collectively will have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows new regulations or compliance issues that we do not currently anticipate could have the potential to harm our financial condition results of operations or cash flows in future periods INSURANCE We carry insurance of types customary in the airline industry and in amounts deemed adequate to protect our interests and property and to comply both with federal regulations and certain credit and lease agreements The insurance policies principally provide coverage for Airline Hull Spares and Comprehensive Legal Liability Insurance War and Allied Perils and Workers Compensation In addition we currently carry a Cyber Liability policy in the event of security breaches from malicious parties We believe that our emphasis on safety and our stateoftheart flight deck safety technology help to control the cost of our insurance WHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION

case the trading price of our common stock could also decline We operate in a continually changing business environment In this environment new risks may emerge and already identified risks may vary significantly in terms of impact and likelihood of occurrence Management cannot predict such developments nor can it assess the impact if any on our business of such new risk factors or of events described in any forwardlooking statements We have adopted an enterprise wide Risk Analysis and Oversight Program designed to identify the various risks faced by the organization assign responsibility for managing those risks to individual executives as well as align these risks with Board oversight These enterpriselevel risks have been aligned to the risk factors discussed below SAFETY COMPLIANCE AND OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE Our reputation and financial results could be harmed in the event of an airline accident or incident An accident or incident involving one of our aircraft or an aircraft operated by one of our codeshare partners or CPA carriers could involve a significant loss of life and result in a loss of confidence in our airlines by the flying public andor aviation authorities We could experience significant claims from injured passengers bystanders and surviving relatives as well as costs for the repair or replacement of a damaged aircraft and its consequential temporary or permanent loss from service We maintain liability insurance in amounts and of the type generally consistent with industry practice as do our codeshare partners and CPA carriers However the amount of such coverage may not be adequate to fully cover all claims and we may be forced to bear substantial economic losses from such event Substantial claims resulting from an accident in excess of our related insurance coverage would harm our business and financial results Moreover any aircraft accident or incident even if it is fully insured and does not involve one of our aircraft could cause a public perception that our airlines or the aircraft we or our partners fly are less safe or reliable than other transportation alternatives This would harm our business 18 Our operations are often affected by factors beyond our control including delays cancellations and other conditions which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations As is the case for all airlines our operations often are affected by delays cancellations and other conditions caused by factors largely beyond our control Factors that might impact our operations include  congestion andor space constraints at airports or air traffic control problems  lack of operational approval eg new routes aircraft deliveries etc  adverse weather conditions  increased security measures or breaches in security  contagious illness and fear of contagion  changes in international treaties concerning air rights  international or domestic conflicts or terrorist activity and  other changes in business conditions Due to our concentration of flights in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska we believe a large portion of our operation is more susceptible to adverse weather conditions A general reduction in airline passenger traffic as a result of any of the abovementioned factors could harm our business financial condition and results of operations Changes in government regulation imposing additional requirements and restrictions on our operations could increase our operating costs and result in service delays and disruptions Airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal requirements both domestically and internationally that involve significant compliance costs In the last several years Congress has passed laws and the US DOT the TSA and the FAA have issued regulations that have required significant expenditures relating to maintenance of aircraft operation of airlines and establishment of consumer protection Similarly there are a number of legislative and regulatory initiatives and reforms at the federal state and local levels These initiatives include increasingly stringent laws to protect the environment minimum wage requirements and health care mandates They could affect our relationship with our workforce and the vendors that serve our airlines and cause our expenses to increase without an ability to pass through these costs Almost all commercial service airports are owned andor operated by units of local or state governments Airlines are largely dependent on these governmental entities to provide adequate airport facilities and capacity at an affordable cost Many airports have increased their rates and charges to air carriers to reflect higher costs of security updates to infrastructures and other Additional laws regulations taxes airport rates and airport charges may be occasionally proposed that could significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce the demand for air travel Although lawmakers may impose these additional fees and view them as passthrough costs we believe that a higher total ticket price will influence consumer purchase and travel decisions and may result in an overall decline in passenger traffic which would harm our business The airline industry continues to face potential security concerns and related costs Terrorist attacks the fear of such attacks or other hostilities involving the US could have a significant negative effect on the airline industry including us and could  significantly reduce passenger traffic and yields as a result of a potentially dramatic drop in demand for air travel  significantly increase security and insurance costs 19  make war risk or other insurance unavailable or extremely expensive  increase fuel costs and the volatility of fuel prices  increase costs from airport shutdowns flight cancellations and delays resulting from security breaches and perceived safety threats and  result in a grounding of commercial air traffic by the FAA The occurrence of any of these events would harm our business financial condition and results of operations We rely on thirdparty vendors for certain critical activities We rely on outside vendors for a variety of services and functions critical to our business including airframe and engine maintenance ground handling fueling computer reservation system hosting telecommunication systems and information technology infrastructure and services Even though we strive to formalize agreements with these vendors that define expected service levels our use of outside vendors increases our exposure to several risks In the event that one or more vendors go into bankruptcy ceases operation or fails to perform as promised replacement services may not be readily available at competitive rates or at all If one of our vendors fails to perform adequately we may experience increased costs delays maintenance issues safety issues or negative public perception of our airline Vendor bankruptcies unionization regulatory compliance issues or significant changes in the competitive marketplace among suppliers could adversely affect vendor services or force us to renegotiate existing agreements on less favorable terms These events could result in disruptions in our operations or increases in our cost structure STRATEGY The airline industry is highly competitive and susceptible to price discounting and changes in capacity which could have a material adverse effect on our business If we cannot successfully compete in the marketplace our business financial condition and operating results will be materially adversely affected The US airline industry is characterized by substantial price competition In recent years the market share held by lowcost carriers and ultra lowcost carriers has increased significantly and is expected to continue to increase Airlines also compete for market share by increasing or decreasing their capacity route systems and the number of markets served Several of our competitors have increased their capacity in markets we serve particularly on the West Coast and in our Seattle hub resulting in increased competition for those destinations Increased competition in both domestic and international markets may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition or liquidity We continue to strive toward aggressive costreduction goals that are an important part of our business strategy of offering the best value to our guests through competitive fares while achieving acceptable profit margins and return on capital If we are unable to reduce our costs over the longterm and achieve sustained targeted returns on invested capital we will likely not be able to grow our business in the future or weather industry downturns Therefore our financial results may suffer The airline industry may undergo further restructuring consolidation or the creation or modification of alliances or joint ventures any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations We continue to face strong competition from other carriers due to restructuring consolidation and the creation and modification of alliances and joint ventures Since deregulation both the US and international airline industries have experienced consolidation through a number of mergers and acquisitions Carriers may also improve their competitive positions through airline alliances slot swapsacquisitions andor joint ventures Certain airline joint ventures further competition by allowing airlines to coordinate routes pool revenues and costs and enjoy other mutual benefits achieving many of the benefits of consolidation We depend on a few key markets to be successful Our strategy includes being the premier carrier for people living on the West Coast This results in a high concentration of our business in key West Coast markets A significant portion of our flights occur to and from our Seattle hub In 2016  passengers to and from Seattle accounted for 61 of our total guests We expect this to become more diversified in the future as a result of the recent acquisition of Virgin America whose primary hubs are San Francisco and Los Angeles 20 We believe that concentrating our service offerings in this way allows us to maximize our investment in personnel aircraft and ground facilities as well as to gain greater advantage from sales and marketing efforts in those regions As a result we remain highly dependent on our key markets Our business could be harmed by any circumstances causing a reduction in demand for air transportation in our key markets An increase in competition in our key markets could also cause us to reduce fares or take other competitive measures that if sustained could harm our business financial condition and results of operations Economic uncertainty or another recession would likely impact demand for our product and could harm our financial condition and results of operations The airline industry which is subject to relatively high fixed costs and highly variable and unpredictable demand is particularly sensitive to changes in economic conditions We are also highly dependent on US consumer confidence and the health of the US economy Unfavorable US economic conditions have historically driven changes in travel patterns and have resulted in reduced spending for both leisure and business travel For some consumers leisure travel is a discretionary expense and shorter distance travelers in particular have the option to replace air travel with surface travel Businesses are able to forgo air travel by using communication alternatives such as videoconferencing or may be more likely to purchase less expensive tickets to reduce costs which can result in a decrease in average revenue per seat Unfavorable economic conditions also hamper the ability of airlines to raise fares to counteract increased fuel labor and other costs Unfavorable or even uncertain economic conditions could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations We are dependent on a limited number of suppliers for aircraft and parts Alaska is dependent on Boeing as its sole supplier for aircraft and many aircraft parts Virgin America is similarly dependent on Airbus and Horizon is dependent on Bombardier and soon Embraer Additionally each carrier is dependent on sole suppliers for aircraft engines for each aircraft type As a result we are more vulnerable to issues associated with the supply of those aircraft and parts including design defects mechanical problems contractual performance by the manufacturers or adverse perception by the public that would result in customer avoidance or in actions by the FAA resulting in an inability to operate our aircraft or instability in the foreign countries in which the aircraft and its parts are manufactured We rely on partner airlines for codeshare and frequent flyer marketing arrangements Our airlines are parties to marketing agreements with a number of domestic and international air carriers or partners These agreements provide that certain flight segments operated by us are held out as partner codeshare flights and that certain partner flights are held out for sale as Alaska or Virgin America codeshare flights In addition the agreements generally provide that members of Alaskas Mileage Plan program or Virgin Americas Elevate program can earn credit on or redeem credit for partner flights and vice versa We receive revenue from flights sold under codeshare and from interline arrangements In addition we believe that the frequent flyer arrangements are an important part of our frequent flyer programs The loss of a significant partner through bankruptcy consolidation or otherwise could have a negative effect on our revenues or the attractiveness of our Mileage Plan and Elevate programs which we believe is a source of competitive advantage We routinely engage in analysis and discussions regarding our own strategic position including alliances codeshare arrangements interline arrangements and frequent flyer program enhancements and may have future discussions with other airlines regarding similar activities If other airlines participate in consolidation or reorganization those airlines may significantly improve their cost structures or revenue generation capabilities thereby potentially making them stronger competitors of ours and potentially impairing our ability to realize expected benefits from our own strategic relationships 21 INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY We rely heavily on automated systems to operate our business and a failure to invest in new technology or a disruption of our current systems or their operators could harm our business We depend on automated systems to operate our business including our airline reservation system our telecommunication systems our website our maintenance systems our checkin kiosks mobile devices and other systems Substantially all of our tickets are issued to our guests as electronic tickets and the majority of our customers check in using our website airport kiosks or our mobile application We depend on our reservation system to be able to issue track and accept these electronic tickets In order for our operations to work efficiently we must continue to invest in new technology to ensure that our website reservation system and checkin systems are able to accommodate a high volume of traffic maintain information security and deliver important flight information Substantial or repeated website reservations system or telecommunication systems failures or service disruptions could reduce the attractiveness of our services and cause our guests to do business with another airline In addition we rely on other automated systems for crew scheduling flight dispatch and other operational needs In 2017 subsequent to year end we migrated to a new crew management system We also plan to move our primary data center location Disruptions failed migration untimely recovery or a breach of these systems or the data center could result in the loss of important data an increase of our expenses an impact on our operational performance or a possible temporary cessation of our operations If we do not maintain the privacy and security of our information we could damage our reputation and incur substantial legal and regulatory costs We accept store and transmit information about our guests our employees our business partners and our business In addition we frequently rely on thirdparty hosting sites and data processors including cloud providers Our sensitive information relies on secure transmission over public and private networks A compromise of our systems the security of our infrastructure or those of other business partners that result in our information being accessed or stolen by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our operations and our reputation FINANCIAL CONDITION AND FINANCIAL MARKETS Our business financial condition and results of operations are substantially exposed to the volatility of jet fuel prices Significant increases in jet fuel costs would harm our business Fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our total operating expenses Future increases in the price of jet fuel may harm our business financial condition and results of operations unless we are able to increase fares and fees or add additional ancillary services to attempt to recover increasing fuel costs Our indebtedness and other fixed obligations could increase the volatility of earnings and otherwise restrict our activities and potentially lead to liquidity constraints We incurred a significant amount of new debt to finance our acquisition of Virgin America We now have and will continue to have for the foreseeable future a substantial amount of debt Due to our high fixed costs including aircraft lease commitments and debt service a decrease in revenues would result in a disproportionately greater decrease in earnings Our outstanding longterm debt and other fixed obligations could have important consequences For example they could limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our future capital expenditures acquisitions working capital or other purposes require us to dedicate a material portion of our operating cash flow to fund lease payments and interest payments on indebtedness thereby reducing funds available for other purposes or limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions Although we have historically been able to generate sufficient cash flow from our operations to pay our debt and other fixed obligations when they become due we cannot ensure we will be able to do so in the future If we fail to do so our business could be harmed See Liquidity and Capital Resources within Item 7 of this filing for more detailed information about our obligations and commitments 22 Certain of our financing agreements have covenants that impose operating and financial restrictions on us Certain of our credit facilities and indentures governing our secured borrowings impose certain operating and financial covenants on us Such covenants require us to maintain depending on the particular agreement minimum liquidity andor minimum collateral coverage ratios and other negative covenants customary for such financings A decline in the value of collateral could result in a situation where we may not be able to maintain the required collateral coverage ratio Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control including the overall industry revenue environment and the level of fuel costs and we may be required to seek waivers or amendments of covenants repay all or a portion of the debt or find alternative sources of financing Our maintenance costs will increase as our fleet ages and we will periodically incur substantial maintenance costs due to the maintenance schedules of our aircraft fleet As of December 31 2016  the average age of our NextGen aircraft B737800 900 900ERs was approximately 73 years the average age of our Q400 aircraft was approximately 10 years and the average age of our A319 and A320 aircraft was approximately 68 years Our relatively new aircraft currently require less maintenance than they will in the future Any significant increase in maintenance expenses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations BRAND AND REPUTATION As we evolve our brand to appeal to a changing demographic and grow into new markets we will engage in strategic initiatives that may not be favorably received by all our guests We continue to focus on strategic initiatives designed to increase our brand appeal to a diverse and evolving demographic of airline travelers These efforts could include significant enhancements to our inairport and onboard environments increasing our direct customer relationships through improvements to our purchasing portals digital and mobile and optimization of our customer loyalty programs In pursuit of these efforts we may negatively affect our reputation with some of our existing customer base LABOR RELATIONS AND LABOR STRATEGY A significant increase in labor costs unsuccessful attempts to strengthen our relationships with union employees or loss of key personnel could adversely affect our business and results of operations Labor costs are a significant component of our total expenses Each of Alaska and Horizons represented employee groups has a separate collective bargaining agreement Through negotiations or transition agreements in the Virgin America integration each group could make demands that would increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our financial performance if we agree to them The same result could apply if we experience a significant increase in vendor labor costs including wage rate increases which could ultimately flow through to us under the applicable services agreement As of December 31 2016  labor unions represented approximately 84 of Alaskas and 43 of Horizons employees Although Virgin America employees are not currently covered under collective bargaining agreements pilots and inflight teammates have elected to be represented and will through negotiations ultimately enter into joint collective bargaining agreements with Alaskas represented workforce Although we have been successful in fostering communications negotiating approaches and developing other strategies to enhance workforce engagement in our longterm vision future uncertainty around open contracts  including the joint collective bargaining negotiations for the integration of Alaskas and Virgin Americas represented work groups  could be a distraction affecting employee focus on our business and diverting managements attention from other projects and issues We compete against the major US airlines and other businesses for labor in many highly skilled positions If we are unable to hire train and retain qualified employees at a reasonable cost sustain employee engagement in our strategic vision or if we are unsuccessful at implementing succession plans for our key staff we may be unable to grow or sustain our business In recent years there have been pilot shortages in hiring in the regional market and there is an anticipated pilot shortage in hiring in the mainline markets in the next two to three years Attrition beyond normal levels could negatively impact our operating results and our business prospects could be harmed 23 Employees could also engage in job actions such as slowdowns worktorule campaigns sickouts or other actions designed to disrupt our normal operations in an attempt to pressure us to acquiesce to wage or other demands during Section 6 negotiations or transition agreement discussions Although the Railway Labor Act makes such selfhelp unlawful until the National Mediation Board releases the parties following lengthy mediation attempts and we could seek injunctive relief or other remedies against premature selfhelp such actions could cause significant harm even if we were ultimately to be successful ACQUISITION AND INTEGRATION OF VIRGIN AMERICA We may be unable to effectively integrate Virgin Americas business and realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition In addition delays in integration could cause anticipated synergies to take longer to realize than currently anticipated We must devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of Virgin America Potential difficulties we may encounter as part of the integration process include the following  the inability to successfully combine the Virgin America business with that of Alaskas in a manner that permits us to achieve anticipated net synergies and other anticipated benefits of the acquisition  the inability to successfully attract and retain Virgin America guests upon integration with Alaska  the challenges associated with operating aircraft types new to our operations specifically the Airbus A319 and A320  the challenges associated with an expanded or new presence in more congested airports and markets  the challenges associated with integrating complex systems technology aircraft fleets networks facilities and other assets in a seamless manner that minimizes any adverse impact on guests suppliers employees and other constituents  the challenges associated with integrating Virgin America employees into Alaskas workforce while maintaining our focus on providing consistent high quality customer service including seniority list integration negotiation of transition process agreements and in the case of the pilot workgroups negotiation of a joint collective bargaining agreement and  potential unknown liabilities liabilities that are significantly larger than we currently anticipate and unforeseen increased expenses or delays including costs to integrate Virgin Americas business that may exceed our current estimates Any of the foregoing factors could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with guests suppliers employees and other constituencies or our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition on a timely basis or at all These factors could also reduce our earnings or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results In addition integration requirements have caused and may continue to cause a delay of other strategic initiatives The Virgin brand is not under our control and negative publicity related to the Virgin brand name could materially adversely affect our business Virgin America licenses rights to the Virgin brand from certain entities affiliated with the Virgin Group on a nonexclusive basis The Virgin brand is also licensed to and used by a number of other companies including two airlines Virgin Atlantic Airways and Virgin Australia Airlines operating in other geographies We rely on the general goodwill of consumers and our employees towards the Virgin brand Consequently any adverse publicity in relation to the Virgin brand name its principals particularly Sir Richard Branson who is closely associated with the brand or another Virginbranded company over which we have no control or influence could have a material adverse effect on our business We obtain our rights to use the Virgin brand under agreements with certain entities affiliated with the Virgin Group and we would lose those rights if these agreements are terminated or not renewed Virgin America is a party to license agreements with certain entities affiliated with the Virgin Group pursuant to which we obtain rights to use the Virgin brand The licensor may terminate the agreements upon the occurrence of a number of specified events including if Virgin America commits a material breach of our obligations under the agreements that is uncured for more than 10 business days or if we materially damage the Virgin brand If we lose our rights to use the Virgin brand we would lose the goodwill associated with the brand name which would likely require substantial expenditures and our business and financial condition would likely be materially adversely affected 24 The need to integrate Virgin Americas workforce into joint collective bargaining agreements with Alaskas workforce presents the potential for delay in achieving expected synergies and other benefits or labor disputes that could adversely affect our operations and costs The successful integration of Virgin America and achievement of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition depend significantly on integrating Virgin Americas employees into Alaska and on maintaining productive employee relations Failure to do so presents the potential for delays in achieving expected synergies and other benefits of integration or labor disputes that could adversely affect our operations and costs The process for integrating labor groups in an airline merger is governed by a combination of the Railway Labor Act the McCaskillBond Act and where applicable the existing provisions of our collective bargaining agreements CBAs and internal union policies Under the Railway Labor Act the National Mediation Board has exclusive authority to resolve representation disputes arising out of airline mergers The disputes that the National Mediation Board has authority to resolve include i whether the carriers through the merger have integrated operations to the point of creating a single transportation system for representation purposes ii determination of the appropriate craft or class for representational purposes including a determination of which positions are to be included within a particular craft or class and iii certification of the systemwide representative organization if any for each of our craft or class following the merger Failure to resolve these disputes could result in delays in achieving expected synergies and other benefits of integration as well as adversely impact our operations and costs Pending operational integration of Virgin America with Alaska it will be necessary to maintain a fence between Alaska and Virgin America employee groups that are represented by unions During this time we will keep the employee groups separate each applying the terms of its own existing employment agreements unless other terms have been negotiated Achievement of expected synergies and other benefits will be delayed until the time that operational integration is obtained We are expected to incur substantial expenses related to the acquisition and the integration of Virgin Americas business We are expected to incur substantial integration and transition expenses in connection with the acquisition of Virgin America including the necessary costs associated with integrating the operations of Alaska and Virgin America There are a large number of processes policies procedures operations technologies and systems that must be integrated including reservations frequent flyer ticketingdistribution maintenance and flight operations While we have assumed that a certain level of expenses will be incurred there are many factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or the timing of the integration expenses Moreover many of the expenses that will be incurred are by their nature difficult to estimate accurately These expenses could particularly in the near term exceed the financial benefits we expect to achieve from the acquisition including the elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale and cost savings These integration expenses likely will continue to result in us taking significant charges against earnings in future periods and the amount and timing of such charges are uncertain at present We acquired Virgin Americas indebtedness upon closing of the acquisition which additional indebtedness may limit our financial and operating flexibility Upon closing of the acquisition we acquired Virgin Americas outstanding indebtedness and became subject to the operating restrictions under the debt instruments governing such indebtedness Virgin America has significant debt and lease obligations related to existing purchased and leased aircraft Our increased indebtedness following the acquisition may  require a substantial portion of cash flows from operations for debt service payments and operating lease payments thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and other general corporate purposes and  limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in its business and the airline industry and consequently negatively affect our competitive position We will need to launch certain branding or rebranding initiatives in connection with the acquisition that may take a significant amount of time and involve substantial costs and that may not be favorably received by our guests We may incur substantial costs if we decide to rebrand any of Virgin Americas products and services and may not be able to achieve or maintain brand name recognition or status that is comparable to the recognition and status previously enjoyed by Virgin America in any of Virgin Americas markets The failure of any such rebranding initiatives could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain guests which could cause us not to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits contemplated to result from the acquisition 25 Our ability to use Virgin Americas net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income for US federal and state income tax purposes may be limited as a result of the previous ownership changes this acquisition or taxable income if it does not reach sufficient levels As of the acquisition closing date Virgin America had federal net operating loss carryforwards NOLs of approximately  773 million available to offset future taxable income expiring between 2028 and 2036  and state NOLs of approximately  344 million that expire beginning in 2027 and continuing through 2035  Virgin America has experienced multiple ownership changes as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as amended the Code the most recent being its acquisition by us Section 382 of the Code imposes an annual limitation on the amount of preownership change NOLs of the corporation that experiences ownership change The limitation imposed by Section 382 of the Code for any postownership change year generally would be determined by multiplying the value of such corporations stock immediately before the ownership change by the applicable longterm taxexempt rate Any unused annual limitation may subject to certain limits be carried over to later years and the limitation may under certain circumstances be increased by builtin gains or reduced by builtin losses in the assets held by such corporation at the time of the ownership change Our use of NOLs generated after the date of an ownership change would not be limited unless we were to experience a subsequent ownership change Our ability to use the NOLs will also depend on the amount of taxable income generated in future periods The NOLs may expire before we can generate sufficient taxable income to utilize the NOLs The application of the acquisition method of accounting resulted in us recording a significant amount of goodwill which could result in significant future impairment charges and negatively affect our financial results In accordance with applicable acquisition accounting rules we recorded goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet to the extent the Virgin America acquisition purchase price exceeded the net fair value of Virgin Americas tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually We could record impairment charges in our results of operations as a result of among other items extreme fuel price volatility a significant decline in the fair value of certain tangible or intangible assets unfavorable trends in forecasted results of operations and cash flows uncertain economic environment and other uncertainties We can provide no assurance that a significant impairment charge will not occur in one or more future periods Any such charges may materially negatively affect our financial results ITEM 1B UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None ITEM 2 PROPERTIES 26 AIRCRAFT The following table describes the aircraft

it is subject to various contingencies including the potential costs and risks associated with litigation and the actions of judges and juries In 2015 three flight attendants filed a class action lawsuit seeking to represent all Virgin America flight attendants for damages based on alleged violations of California and City of San Francisco wage and hour laws Plaintiffs received class certification in November 2016 Virgin America filed a motion for summary judgment seeking to dismiss all claims on various federal preemption grounds In January 2017 the Court denied in part and granted in part Virgin Americas motion Virgin America believes the claims in this case are without factual and legal merit and intends to defend this lawsuit through among other 27 strategies filing a motion for reconsideration of the Courts certification decision and denial of summary judgment and if necessary a motion for certification of interlocutory appeal to the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ITEM 4 MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES Not applicable PART II
