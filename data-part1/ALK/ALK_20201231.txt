PART I ITEM 1 OUR BUSINESS Alaska Air Group is a Delaware corporation incorporated in 1985 that operates two airlines Alaska and Horizon Alaska was organized in 1932 and incorporated in 1937 in the state of Alaska Horizon is a Washington corporation that was incorporated and began service in 1981 and was acquired by Air Group in 1986 Virgin America was a member of Air Group from its acquisition in 2016 through 2018 at which time Alaska and Virgin America combined operating certificates and legally merged into a single entity The Company also includes McGee Air Services an aviation services provider that was established as a whollyowned subsidiary of Alaska in 2016 and other subsidiaries Alaska and Horizon operate as separate airlines with individual business plans competitive factors and economic risks We organize the business and review financial operating performance by aggregating our business in three operating segments which are as follows  Mainline  includes scheduled air transportation on Alaskas Boeing and Airbus jet aircraft for passengers and cargo throughout the US and in parts of Mexico and Costa Rica  Regional  includes Horizons and other thirdparty carriers scheduled air transportation for passengers across a shorter distance network within the US and Canada under capacity purchase agreements CPA This segment includes the actual revenues and expenses associated with regional flying as well as an allocation of corporate overhead incurred by Air Group on behalf of the regional operations  Horizon  includes the capacity sold to Alaska under a CPA Expenses include those typically borne by regional airlines such as crew costs ownership costs and maintenance costs Together we are the fifth largest airline in the United States offering unparalleled guest service connectivity and schedules from our hub markets along the West Coast With our regional partners we fly to more than 115 destinations throughout the United States and North America We have operated in a highly competitive and often challenging industry for over 88 years Our top priority as an airline is ensuring the safety of our guests and employees an area that we have continued to invest in during 2020 despite the significant financial challenges we encountered Our success over many decades and resilience in difficult times is attributable to our people business model and commitment to sustainable growth over the longterm 2020 was a year of uncertainty and challenge The impact of the pandemic stemming from the outbreak of the novel coronavirus COVID19 presented us with the greatest financial challenge in our history Travel restrictions and stayathome orders coupled with the closure of many popular destinations and the cancellation of major events drove demand for air travel to historic lows in the spring of 2020 Although we have seen modest improvement since that time including improved booking activity at the end of 2020 and in early 2021 demand remains well below historical levels In response to reduced demand we acted quickly to preserve cash by reducing flying across our network and removing fixed and discretionary costs to the greatest extent possible We also prepared for a potentially long recovery period by accessing 5 billion in liquidity including private placement offerings government funding bank debt and the sale of ten Airbus aircraft Part of the government funding received was through the Payroll Support Program of the Coronavirus Aid Relief and Economic Security CARES Act which provided critical support to enable us to preserve jobs and continue to provide an essential service to the communities we serve Although our debt balances have increased our cash preservation efforts were effective and our adjusted net debt at the end of 2020 is substantially unchanged from the end of 2019 Protecting the health of our balance sheet has positioned us well for the recovery that is expected in 2021 and beyond We took action early in the pandemic to ensure a safe environment for guests and our employees We launched our NextLevel Care initiative which includes over 100 safety measures that have been and will continue to be vital to restoring guest confidence in travel onboard our aircraft To provide peace of mind in guests travel decisions we also eliminated change fees for first class or main cabin itineraries and we extended the expiry of outstanding travel credits to December 31 2021 Although the pandemic has had a significant negative impact on our business we have attempted to reduce its effect on our employees where possible To minimize the need for involuntary furloughs we instituted earlyout and voluntary leave programs which were accepted by 3900 employees Additionally we aligned the focus of our 22000 employees on reducing cash burn and delivering a safe travel experience for guests by creating an incentive program designed to supplement our traditional performancebased pay and operational performance programs Through these programs our employees earned 130 million in incentive pay in 2020 We strongly believe that aligning employees under common goals makes our company better 4 and expect that Alaska and Horizon will be among the only airlines in the US to provide generous incentive payments for employees in 2020 In spite of the difficult year Alaska and Horizon continued to actively support the communities we serve In 2020 Air Group companies donated 10 million in cash and inkind travel to over 900 charitable organizations and our employees volunteered more than 17000 hours of community service related to youth and education medical research and transportation Our cargo business also provided critical support to communities in need by transporting essential goods and shipments of COVID19 vaccines throughout the state of Alaska As we look forward we know that our business is dependent on getting guests flying again and getting our people and assets back to work Now that the the initial response to the pandemic is largely behind us we have shifted our attention toward recovery as we prepare for the return in demand Over the next several months as the recovery ensues our focus areas include the following Capturing demand for travel Capturing the demand that exists for travel will be vital to our recovery In 2020 the rebound in leisure travel was much more robust than business travel and we expect to see that trend continue in 2021 To capture that leisure demand we announced 30 new routes in 2020 aimed at connecting our guests to warmweather and outdoor recreation locations To further reduce travel friction we have worked with health partners and local governments to implement processes to meet locallymandated travel requirements In December 2020 in partnership with the state of Hawaii government Alaska was the first airline to launch a preclearance program to Hawaii providing our guests with a seamless travel experience and allowing them to bypass screening upon arrival We expect these preclearance programs to mature in 2021 and believe they will aid overall recovery and willingness of travelers to fly We believe marketing to guests who may soon return to travel and ensuring they are familiar with our safety initiatives is key to capturing demand as it returns Toward the end of 2020 we launched several campaigns encouraging guests to book future travel Our Lets Go Campaign emphasized the layers of safety we have put in place and our friends and family discount program engaged our employees in reaching out to guests These promotions and others like them stimulated bookings and the results have served as an encouraging indicator that our guests are eager to return to travel in 2021 In 2020 we announced the West Coast International Alliance WCIA with American Airlines Inc American which will provide more destinations greater utility and more value for our guests and loyalty members The alliance will allow Alaska Mileage Plan members to enjoy benefits across both airlines by early spring 2021 In conjunction with our partnership with American we accepted a formal invitation to join the one world global alliance with entry expected on March 31 2021 Alaska Mileage Plan TM members will have significantly expanded benefits in the one world program including reciprocal tier status in one world as well as the ability to earn and use miles to reach more than 1000 destinations worldwide The WCIA and one world enhances Alaskas presence globally and will position us to capture an incremental share of global travelers and corporate accounts as recovery begins to take shape Reducing our cost structure and strengthening our balance sheet Maintaining a low cost structure has been critical to our past success and we believe it will be even more important in the recovery ahead In 2020 we reduced our adjusted nonfuel operating costs by 13 billion or 22 from 2019 through reductions in flying and minimizing discretionary expenditures As we return aircraft to service and build capacity in recovery we are focused on returning to 2019 unit cost levels excluding fuel and special items even if we are a smaller company To this end we have identified over 250 million in structural cost savings initiatives that we began to realize in the fourth quarter of 2020 which will continue to ramp through 2021 Having low costs when demand returns will enable us to return to profitability more quickly and will lead to positive cash flow generation This in turn will enable us to begin repaying the debt that we have taken on which is foundational for our future growth Additionally exiting 2020 with adjusted net debt that is largely flat as compared to the prior year means that we have cash on hand that can be used to pay down debt when we believe we are in a stable recovery In late 2020 Alaska announced an agreement in principle with Boeing to restructure and grow the existing Boeing 737 MAX MAX aircraft purchase agreement As part of this restructuring Alaska renegotiated the terms of its aircraft order with Boeing which will expand the total firm aircraft to 55 to be delivered between 2021 and 2024 with options to purchase an additional 52 aircraft with delivery between 2023 and 2026 Alaska also announced an agreement with Air Lease Corporation to obtain an additional 13 leased MAX aircraft with deliveries between 2021 and 2022 bringing total firm deliveries of MAX aircraft to 68 by 2024 This will allow us to replace Airbus A319 and A320 aircraft that will be returned off lease over the next 5 few years Further this agreement provides the flexibility to align our growth with the demand environment Shifting substantially to a single mainline fleet that is more efficient profitable and sustainable will help support our overall longterm goals We have a long track record of disciplined cost control and balance sheet management and we will continue to aggressively manage both as we navigate through and exit the COVID19 pandemic AIR GROUP Our airlines operate different aircraft and missions Alaska operates a fleet of narrowbody passenger jets on primarily longer stagelength routes Alaska contracts primarily with Horizon and SkyWest Airlines Inc SkyWest for shorterhaul capacity such that Alaska receives all passenger revenue from those flights Horizon operates Embraer 175 E175 regional jet aircraft and Bombardier Q400 turboprop aircraft and sells all of its capacity to Alaska pursuant to a CPA The

17 airline partners by using an Alaska Airlines credit card or through other nonairline partners Alaskas extensive list of airline partners includes carriers associated with each of the three major global alliances making it easier for our members to earn miles and reach elite status in our frequent flyer program Through Alaska and our global partners Mileage Plan members have access to a large network of over 800 worldwide travel destinations Further members can receive up to 50000 bonus miles upon signing up for the Alaska Airlines Visa Signature card and meeting a minimum spend threshold and earn triple miles on Alaska Airlines purchases Alaska Airlines Visa Signature cardholders and small business cardholders in the US and Platinum and World Elite Mastercard cardholders in Canada also receive an annual companion ticket that allows members to purchase an additional ticket for 99 plus taxes with no restrictions or blackout dates and a free first checked bag for up to six people traveling on the same itinerary Earned miles can be redeemed for flights on our airlines or our partner airlines for hotel stays via mileageplanhotelscom or for upgrades to first class on Alaska Airlines We believe all of these benefits give our Mileage Plan members more value than competing programs Mileage Plan revenues including those in the Passenger revenue income statement line item represented approximately 20 of Air Groups total revenues in 2020 Mileage Plan helps drive revenue growth by attracting new customers keeping existing customers actively engaged and building customer loyalty through the benefits that we provide 7 AGREEMENTS WITH OTHER AIRLINES Our agreements fall into three different categories frequent flyer codeshare and interline agreements Frequent flyer agreements enable our Mileage Plan TM members to earn mileage credits and make redemptions on one of our 17 domestic and international partner airlines Codeshare agreements allow one or more marketing carriers to sell seats on a single operating carrier that services passengers under multiple flight numbers The sale of codeshare seats can vary depending on the sale arrangement For example in a freesale arrangement the marketing carrier sells the operating carriers inventory without any restriction whereas in a blockspace arrangement a fixed amount of seats are sold to the marketing carrier by the operating carrier The interchangeability of the flight code between carriers provides a greater selection of flights for customers along with increased flexibility for mileage accrual and redemption Interline agreements allow airlines to jointly offer a competitive singlefare itinerary to customers traveling via multiple carriers to a final destination An interline itinerary offered by one airline may not necessarily be offered by the other and the fares collected from passengers are prorated and distributed to interline partners according to preexisting agreements between the carriers Frequent flyer codeshare and interline agreements help increase our traffic and revenue by providing a more diverse network and schedule options to our guests Alaska has marketing alliances with a number of airlines that provide frequent flyer and codesharing opportunities On March 31 2021 Alaska intends to join the one world Alliance Upon entry Mileage Plan elite members will receive one world status which enables the benefits of tier status recognition and eligible benefits across all 13 one world member airlines providing access to over 1000 destinations Alliances are an important part of our strategy and enhance our revenues by  offering our guests more travel destinations and better mileage credit and redemption opportunities including elite qualifying miles on US and international airline partners  providing a consistent and seamless guest experience when you are flying on Alaska or one of our partners  giving us access to more connecting traffic from other airlines and  providing members of our alliance partners frequent flyer programs an opportunity to travel on Alaska and our regional partners while earning mileage credit in our partners programs Most of our codeshare relationships are freesale codeshares where the marketing carrier sells seats on the operating carriers flights from the operating carriers inventory but takes no inventory risk Our marketing agreements have various termination dates and one or more may be in the process of renegotiation at any time Our codeshare and interline agreements generated 3 5 and 5 of our total marketed revenues as of December 31 2020 2019 and 2018 8 A comprehensive summary of Alaskas alliances with other airlines is as follows Codeshare Airline Frequent Flyer Agreement Alaska Flight  on Flights

provided to commercial businesses and the United States Postal Service The Company satisfies cargo service performance obligations and recognizes revenue when the shipment arrives at its final destination or is transferred to a thirdparty carrier for delivery The Company also earns other revenue for lounge memberships hotel and car commissions and certain other immaterial items not intrinsically tied to providing air travel to passengers Revenue is recognized when these services are rendered and recorded as Cargo and other revenue GENERAL The airline industry is highly competitive and subject to potentially volatile business cycles resulting from factors such as a global pandemic economic conditions volatile fuel prices a largely unionized work force the need to finance large capital expenditures and the related availability of capital government regulationincluding taxes and fees and potential aircraft incidents Airlines have high fixed costs primarily for wages aircraft fuel aircraft ownership and facilities rents Because expenses of a flight do not vary significantly based on the number of passengers carried a relatively small change in the number of passengers or in pricing has a disproportionate effect on an airlines operating and financial results In other words a minor shortfall in expected revenue levels could cause a disproportionately negative impact to our operating and financial results Passenger demand and ticket prices are in large measure influenced by the general state of the economy current global economic and political events and total available airline seat capacity In 2020 the COVID19 pandemic presented the airline industry one of the greatest challenges in the history of aviation In response to the various stayathome orders local restrictions and general uncertainty regarding air travel USbased airlines reduced domestic capacity when compared to 2019 by 75 Although it is uncertain when the impacts of the pandemic will subside competition to capture existing demand for travel in the interim is expected to be intense 9 FUEL Our business and financial results are highly impacted by the price and the availability of aircraft fuel Aircraft fuel expense includes raw fuel expense or the price that we generally pay at the airport including taxes and fees plus the effect of marktomarket adjustments to our fuel hedge portfolio as the value of that portfolio increases and decreases The cost of aircraft fuel is volatile and outside of our control and it can have a significant and immediate impact on our operating results Over the past five years aircraft fuel expense ranged from 14 to 25 of operating expenses Fuel prices are impacted by changes in both the price of crude oil and refining costs and can vary by region in the US The price of crude oil on an average annual basis for the past five years has ranged from a low of 39 per barrel in 2020 to a high of 65 in 2018 For us a 1 per barrel change in the price of oil equates to approximately 11 million of fuel cost annually based on 2020 consumption levels Said another way a onecent change in our fuel price per gallon will impact our expected annual fuel cost by approximately 5 million per year Refining margins which represent the price of refining crude oil into aircraft fuel are a smaller portion of the overall price of jet fuel but have also contributed to the price volatility in recent years Over the last five years average annual West Coast refining margin prices have fluctuated from a low of 11 per barrel in 2020 to a high of 26 per barrel in 2019 Generally West Coast jet fuel prices are somewhat higher and more volatile than prices in the Gulf Coast or on the East Coast Our average raw fuel cost per gallon decreased 29 in 2020 after decreasing 6 in 2019 and increasing 28 in 2018 The percentages of our aircraft fuel expense by crude oil and refining margins as well as the percentage of our aircraft fuel expense of operating expenses are as follows 2020 2019 2018 2017 2016 a Crude oil 64  62  68  66  69  Refining margins 16  28  25  23  20  Other b 20  10  7  11  11  Total 100  100  100  100  100  Aircraft fuel expense 14  24  25  22  18  a Includes information for Virgin America for the period December 14 2016 through December 31 2016 b Other includes gains and losses on settled fuel hedges unrealized marktomarket fuel hedge gains or losses taxes and other intoplane costs We use crude oil call options as hedges against our exposure to the volatility of jet fuel prices Call options effectively cap our price for crude oil limiting our exposure to increasing fuel prices for about half of our planned fuel consumption With call options we are hedged against spikes in crude oil prices and during a period of declines in crude oil prices we only forfeit cash previously paid for hedge premiums We begin hedging approximately 18 months in advance of consumption We believe that operating fuelefficient aircraft and executing on operational best practices are the best hedges against high fuel prices Maintaining a young fuelefficient fleet helps to reduce our fuel consumption rate but also the amount of greenhouse gases and other pollutants that our aircraft emit COMPETITION Competition in the airline industry can be intense and unpredictable Our competitors consist primarily of other airlines and to a lesser extent other forms of transportation Competition can be direct in the form of another carrier flying the exact nonstop route or indirect where a carrier serves the same two cities nonstop from an alternative airport in that city or via an itinerary requiring a connection at another airport We compete with other domestic airlines and a limited number of international airlines on nearly all of our scheduled routes Our largest competitor is Delta Air Lines Inc Delta who has significantly increased its capacity in Seattle since 2013 Approximately 75 of our capacity to and from Seattle competes with Delta As we have grown in California and have expanded our transcontinental route offerings United Airlines and Southwest Airlines have also become large competitors and have increased their capacity in markets we serve Our California and transcontinental routes have a higher concentration of competitors when compared to our historical route structure which was predominately concentrated in the Pacific Northwest Although competitive capacity is expected to be down significantly in the first quarter of 2021 as compared to the first quarter of 2020 given the impacts of the COVID19 pandemic we expect once demand returns that we will face strong competition in all of our primary markets 10 We believe that the following competitive factors matter to guests when making an air travel purchase decision  Safety and guest health Safety is our top priority and is at the core of everything we do In 2021 Alaska was again ranked by AirlineRatingscom as the safest US airline in the Top 20 safest airlines in the world In 2020 we also received our 19th Diamond Award of Excellence from the Federal Aviation Administration FAA recognizing both Alaska and Horizon aircraft technicians for their commitment to training In 2020 our guests were acutely focused on the risk of potential contagion throughout their journey In response we partnered with health and safety experts to build our NextLevel Care initiative In doing so we have added nearly 100 measures through all stages of travel aimed at educating and helping our guests and employees to stay safe and to build confidence in flying For our efforts we received diamond level certification from the Airline Passenger Experience Association in 2020 for the health and safety standards we implemented  Fares and ancillary services Ticket and other fee pricing is a significant competitive factor in the airline industry and the increased availability of fare information on the internet allows travelers to easily compare fares and identify competitor promotions and discounts Pricing is driven by a variety of factors including but not limited to marketspecific capacity market share per routegeographic area cost structure fare vs ancillary revenue strategies and demand For example airlines often discount fares to drive traffic in new markets or to stimulate traffic when necessary to improve load factors In addition traditional network carriers have been able to reduce their operating costs through bankruptcies and mergers while lowcost carriers have continued to grow their fleets and expand their networks potentially enabling them to better control costs per available seat mile the average cost to fly an aircraft seat one mile which in turn may enable them to lower their fares These factors can reduce our pricing power and that of the airline industry as a whole Domestic airline capacity is dominated by four large carriers representing 79 of total seats One of our advantages is that we offer low fares and a premium value product and experience However given the large concentration of industry capacity some carriers in our markets may discount their fares substantially to develop or increase market share Fares that are substantially below our cost to operate can be harmful if sustained over a long period of time We will defend our position in our core markets and if necessary adjust capacity to better match supply with demand Our strong financial position and low cost advantage have historically enabled us to offer competitive fares while still earning returns for our shareholders  Customer service and reputation We compete with other airlines in areas of customer service such as ontime performance and guest amenities  including first class and other premium seating quality of onboard products aircraft type and comfort In the fourth quarter of 2020 Alaska and Horizon were among the top in the industry for ontime performance All mainline aircraft in operating service have our refreshed interior configuration which provides our guests with one consistent experience across the fleet We also began installing nextgeneration Gogo inflight satellitebased WiFi on our entire Boeing and Airbus fleets in 2018 which is now planned to be completed in early 2022 Our employees are a critical element of our reputation We have a highly engaged workforce that strives to provide genuine and caring service to our guests both at the airport and onboard We heavily emphasize our service standards with our employees through training and education programs and monetary incentives related to operational performance and guest satisfaction  Routes served flight schedules codesharing and interline relationships and frequent flyer programs We also compete with other airlines based on markets served the frequency of service to those markets and frequent flyer opportunities Some airlines have more extensive route structures than we do and they offer significantly more international routes In order to expand opportunities for our guests we enter into codesharing and interline relationships with other airlines that provide reciprocal frequent flyer mileage credit and redemption privileges These relationships allow us to offer our guests access to more destinations than we can on our own gain exposure in markets we do not serve 11 and allow our guests more opportunities to earn and redeem frequent flyer miles Our Mileage Plan offers some of the most comprehensive benefits in the industry allowing our members with the ability to earn and redeem miles on 17 partner carriers In 2020 we announced an expanded alliance with American aimed at providing our West Coast guests with greater utility and international options while providing Americans international guests with increased connectivity options covered by the Alaska network Coupled with the expanded alliance we also accepted an invitation to join one world with entrance expected on March 31 2021 These new alliances allow our guests increased global network utility and benefits along with increased opportunity to capture corporate sales when demand returns In addition to domestic or foreign airlines that we compete with on most of our routes we compete with ground transportation in our shorthaul markets Our airlines also compete with technology such as video conferencing and internetbased meeting tools We expect that the advancement and increased utilization of these tools will eliminate the need for some businessrelated travel TICKET DISTRIBUTION Our tickets are distributed through three primary channels  Direct to customer Selling direct at alaskaaircom is less expensive than other channels We believe direct sales through this channel are preferable from a branding and customer relationship standpoint because we can establish ongoing communication with the guest and tailor offers accordingly As a result we continue to take steps to drive more business to our website  Traditional and online travel agencies Both traditional and online travel agencies typically use Global Distribution Systems GDS to obtain their fare and inventory data from airlines Bookings made through these agencies result in a fee that is charged to the airline Many of our large corporate customers require us to use these agencies Some of our competitors do not use this distribution channel or rely on it to a lesser extent than we do and as a result have lower ticket distribution costs  Reservation call centers Our call centers are located in Phoenix AZ Seattle WA and Boise ID We generally charge a 15 fee for booking reservations through the call centers Our sales by channel are as follows 2020 2019 2018 2017 2016 a Direct to customer 73  65  63  62  61  Traditional agencies 12  20  22  22  23  Online travel agencies 9  11  11  11  11  Reservation call centers 6  4  4  5  5  Total 100  100  100  100  100  a Includes results for Virgin America for the period December 14 2016 through December 31 2016 SEASONALITY AND OTHER FACTORS Our results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of those for the entire year because our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations In typical years our profitability is generally lowest during the first and fourth quarters due principally to fewer departures and passengers Profitability typically increases in the second quarter and then reaches its highest level during the third quarter as a result of vacation travel This pattern was not followed in 2020 because of the COVID19 pandemic and 2021 may also experience abnormal trends as a result of the ongoing recovery In a typical year some of the impacts of seasonality are offset by travel from the West Coast to leisure destinations like Hawaii and Costa Rica and expansion to leisure and business destinations in the midcontinental and eastern US Seasonality and operational fluctuations are not predictable in the current environment and may permanently impact our typical experience of passenger loads postpandemic In a typical year in addition to passenger loads factors that could cause our quarterly operating results to vary include  pricing initiatives by us or our competitors 12  changes in fuel costs  increases in competition at our primary airports  general economic conditions and resulting changes in passenger demand  increases or decreases in passenger and volumedriven variable costs and  air space and Air Traffic Control delays particularly in Seattle and San Francisco Many of the markets we serve experience inclement weather conditions in the winter causing increased costs associated with deicing aircraft canceling flights and accommodating displaced passengers Due to our geographic area of operations we can be more susceptible to adverse weather conditions particularly in the state of Alaska and the Pacific Northwest than some of our competitors who may be better able to spread the impact of weatherrelated risks over larger route systems No material part of our business or that of our subsidiaries is dependent upon a single customer or upon a few highvolume customers EMPLOYEES AND HUMAN CAPITAL Our business is labor intensive As of December 31 2020 we employed 21997 16643 at Alaska 3511 at Horizon and 1843 at McGee Air Services active employees Of those employees 88 are fulltime and 12 are parttime Wages and benefits including variable incentive pay represented approximately 47 of our total nonfuel operating expenses in 2020 and 43 in 2019 Approximately 3300 of our employees were on paid or unpaid leaves as of December 31 2020 and are included in the totals above Most major airlines including Alaska and Horizon have employee groups that are covered by collective bargaining agreements Airlines with unionized work forces generally have higher labor costs than carriers without unionized work forces and they may not have the ability to adjust labor costs downward quickly enough to respond to new competition or slowing demand LABOR ORGANIZATIONS At December 31 2020 labor unions represented 86 of Alaskas 51 of Horizons and 87 of McGee Air Services employees Our relations with US labor organizations are governed by the Railway Labor Act RLA Under the RLA collective bargaining agreements do not expire but instead become amendable as of a stated date If either party wishes to modify the terms of any such agreement it must notify the other party in the

1598 Amendable 7192023 Given the ongoing impacts of the COVID19 pandemic which is expected to have lasting impacts on our business into 2021 we have taken action to adjust the size of our workforce To limit the number of involuntary furloughs we initiated earlyout and voluntary leave programs as well as offered incentive leaves for Alaska pilots and aircraft mechanics Approximately 3900 employees opted in to these programs including over 600 employees that volunteered for earlyout separation from Alaska and Horizon In addition we reduced our nonunion management positions by approximately 300 positions As a result of these actions we were able to reduce the number of involuntary furloughs to approximately 400 the majority of which have returned to work by December 31 2020 DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION At Alaska we believe that every person deserves respect regardless of race ethnicity capability age gender or sexual orientation We are committed to advancing equity in all forms and have set specific measurable goals to deliver on our commitments to racial equity In 2020 we joined several other corporate leaders in creating the Washington Employers for Racial Equity which will work to achieve parity in hiring pay and promotion for Black employees support Blackowned businesses and invest a combined 2 billion over the next five years to support racial equity We also recently published our 2025 diversity equity and inclusion goals which will hold us accountable to our commitments to increase racial diversity increase our employee engagement scores around inclusion related topics and create career pathways for at least 175000 young people by supporting programs that empower and enable opportunity through a lens of racial equity 14 EXECUTIVE OFFICERS The executive

the federal government The Department of Transportation DOT the the Transportation Security Administration TSA and the FAA exercise significant regulatory authority over air carriers  DOT A domestic airline is required to hold a certificate of public convenience and necessity issued by the DOT in order to provide passenger and cargo air transportation in the US Subject to certain individual airport capacity noise and other restrictions this certificate permits an air carrier to operate between any two points in the US Certificates do not expire but may be revoked for failure to comply with federal aviation statutes regulations orders or the terms of the certificates While airlines are permitted to establish their own fares without government regulation the DOT has jurisdiction over the approval of international codeshare agreements marketing alliance agreements between major domestic carriers international and some domestic route authorities Essential Air Service market subsidies carrier liability for personal or property damage and certain airport rates and charges disputes International treaties may also contain restrictions or requirements for flying outside of the US and impose different carrier liability limits than those applicable to domestic flights The DOT has been active in implementing a variety of consumer protection regulations covering subjects such as advertising passenger communications denied boarding compensation and tarmac delay response Airlines are subject to enforcement actions that are brought by the DOT for alleged violations of consumer protection and other economic regulations We are not aware of any enforcement proceedings that could either materially affect our financial position or impact our authority to operate  FAA The FAA through Federal Aviation Regulations FARs generally regulates all aspects of airline operations including establishing personnel maintenance and flight operation standards Domestic airlines are required to hold a valid air carrier operating certificate issued by the FAA Pursuant to these regulations we have established and the FAA has approved our operations specifications and a maintenance program for each type of aircraft we operate Each maintenance program provides for the ongoing maintenance of the relevant aircraft type ranging from frequent routine inspections to 16 major overhauls Periodically the FAA issues airworthiness directives ADs that must be incorporated into our aircraft maintenance program and operations All airlines are subject to enforcement actions that are brought by the FAA from time to time for alleged violations of FARs or ADs At this time we are not aware of any enforcement proceedings that could either materially affect our financial position or impact our authority to operate  TSA Airlines serving the US must operate a TSAapproved Aircraft Operator Standard Security Program AOSSP and comply with TSA Security Directives SDs and regulations Under TSA authority we are required to collect a September 11 Security Fee of 560 per oneway trip from passengers and remit that sum to the government to fund aviation security me asures Airlines are subject to enforcement actions that are brought by the TSA for alleged violations of the AOSSP SDs or security regulations We are not aware of any enforcement proceedings that could either materially affect our financial position or impact our authority to operate The Department of Justice and DOT have jurisdiction over airline antitrust matters The US Postal Service has jurisdiction over certain aspects of the transportation of mail and related services Labor relations in the air transportation industry are regulated under the RLA To the extent we continue to fly to foreign countries and pursue alliances with international carriers we may be subject to certain regulations of foreign agencies and international treaties We are also subject to the oversight of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration OSHA concerning employee safety and health matters The OSHA and other federal agencies have been authorized to create and enforce regulations that have an impact on our operations In addition to these federal activities various states have been delegated certain authorities under these federal statutes Many state and local governments have adopted employee safety and health laws and regulations We maintain our safety and health programs in order to meet or exceed these requirements ENVIRONMENTAL We are also subject to various laws and government regulations concerning environmental matters both domestically and internationally Domestic regulations that have an impact to our operations include the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 the Clean Air Act Resource Conservation and Recovery Act Clean Water Act Safe Drinking Water Act the Comprehensive Environmental Response and Compensation Liability Act the National Environmental Policy Act including Environmental Justice Emergency Planning and Community RighttoKnow Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act Many state and local environmental regulations exceed these federal regulations In the future we expect there to be incremental legislation aimed at further reduction of greenhouse gas emissions hazardous substances and additional focus on environmental justice The Airport Noise and Capacity Act recognizes the rights of airport operators with noise problems to implement local noise abatement programs so long as they do not interfere unreasonably with interstate or foreign commerce or the national air transportation system Authorities in several cities have established aircraft noise reduction programs including the imposition of nighttime curfews We believe we have sufficient scheduling flexibility to accommodate local noise restrictions The impacts of carbon dioxide emissions generated by the airline industry and the impact of those emissions on climate change have faced increased scrutiny Further we know that attention to climate issues and impact have grown amongst our employees and guests We recognize that our operations have an impact on the environment and are responsible for addressing those impacts through our own operations as well as in partnership with governments industry manufacturers employees and guests to enable new technology for the longterm The airline industry committed to carbon neutral growth starting in 2020 Through this commitment we have joined participation in the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation CORSIA a global marketbased emissions offset program issued by the International Civil Aviation Organization to be carbon neutral for international growth As a result of the COVID19 pandemic the growth baseline year was modified and set to 2019 during the initial phase This does not have a direct impact on domestic flights however the EPA finalized a rule in 2020 on aircraft emission standards which aligns with the international agreements Additional commitments to decarbonize through the Paris Climate Accord and domestic carbon neutrality remain a potential impact to our industry Our commitment to sustainability is anchored by our efforts to reduce our carbon emissions from jet fuel To mitigate emissions and keep with industry commitments towards reductions we have taken a number of key actions including transitioning to more fuelefficient aircraft fleets such as the Boeing 737 MAX utilizing fuelefficient winglets and flying efficient flight paths Alaska has joined with others at Seattle Tacoma International Airport and San Francisco International Airport to strengthen the pathway to commercially viable sustainable aviation fuel Through an offtake agreement with Neste in San Francisco Alaska has started to use sustainable aviation fuel on an ongoing basis to reduce the lifecycle carbon dioxide emissions of our flights and will help comply with CORSIA obligations In 2020 we also strengthened our commitment to emissions reduction through a partnership with Microsoft Alaska Airlines and Microsoft are partnering to use sustainable 17 aviation fuel to reduce the climate change impact of Microsoft employee travel on the top routes their employees fly In addition Alaska and Horizon continue to utilize electric ground equipment at airports when we have the infrastructure to support it Overall the total Alaska mainline greenhouse gas emissions intensity trend has improved significantly since 2009 with our goals to reduce emissions intensity More broadly we know that being responsible for our impact is a critical part of delivering value for all those who depend on us  employees communities guests and owners  over the long term To that end we are focused on addressing the breadth of our most significant environmental impacts across emissions and waste as well as important social impacts Alaska leads the industry in inflight recycling and has reduced waste to landfill by over 60 per passenger over the past decade In 2018 we were the first US airline to remove plastic straws and stir sticks from our aircraft and in 2019 we launched a campaign called FillBeforeYouFly to engage our employees and guests in reducing plastic waste For more details on Alaskas emission reductions programs as well as status on other key environmental initiatives see Alaskas annual Sustainability Reports and environmental performance metrics on our website wwwflysustainablycomreports The information contained on our sustainability website is not a part of this annual report on Form 10K Although we do not currently anticipate that specific environmental regulation will have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows new regulations related to our existing or past operations or compliance issues could have the impact to harm our financial condition results of operations or cash flows in future periods INSURANCE We carry insurance of types customary in the airline industry and in amounts deemed adequate to protect our interests and property and to comply both with federal regulations and certain credit and lease agreements The insurance policies principally provide coverage for Airline Hull Spares and Comprehensive Legal Liability War and Allied Perils and Workers Compensation In addition we currently carry a Cyber Insurance policy in the event of security breaches from malicious parties We believe that our emphasis on safety and our stateoftheart flight deck safety technology help to control the cost of our insurance WHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION Our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission including our annual report on Form 10K quarterly reports on Form

operations could be harmed The trading price of our common stock could also decline We operate in a continually changing business environment In this environment new risks may emerge and already identified risks may vary significantly in terms of impact and likelihood of occurrence Management cannot predict such developments nor can it assess the impact if any on our business of such new risk factors or of events described in any forwardlooking statements We have adopted an enterprisewide risk analysis and oversight program designed to identify the various risks faced by the organization assign responsibility for managing those risks to individual executives as well as align these risks with Board oversight These enterprisewide risks have been aligned to the risk factors discussed below COVID19 The global pandemic caused by COVID19 and related measures implemented to combat its spread has had and is expected to continue to have a material adverse effect on the Companys operations financial position and liquidity In late 2019 an outbreak of novel coronavirus and its resulting disease COVID19 was detected in Wuhan China Since that time COVID19 has spread rapidly throughout the globe including within the United States where millions of cases have been positively diagnosed to date In March 2020 the President of the United States declared a national emergency in response to the rapid spread and all markets we serve implemented some measure of travel restriction or stayathome order These orders combined with a wariness among the public of travel by aircraft due to perceived risk of infection resulted in an unprecedented decline in business and leisure travel Cancellations of conventions and conferences sporting events concerts and other similar events as well as the closure of popular tourist destinations contributed to this decline This reduction in demand had a material adverse impact on our revenues and results of operations As there is uncertainty of when these restrictions will be lifted or when demand may return we expect to continue to see negative impacts from the COVID19 pandemic on our business Our operations could be negatively affected further if our employees are quarantined or sickened as a result of exposure to COVID19 or if they are subject to additional governmental COVID19 stayathome health orders or similar 19 restrictions Measures restricting the ability of our airport or inflight employees to come to work may cause further deterioration in our service or operations all of which could negatively affect our business Additionally the availability of COVID19 vaccines and the timing of inoculation in each state we serve will impact the willingness of the public to travel and our ability to recover from the impacts of the pandemic In response to the pandemic we implemented and continue to refine and adjust a comprehensive strategy to mitigate the impacts on our business This strategy may itself have negative impacts on our business and operations One such action is the elimination of change fees for first and main cabin fares and the ability to rebook travel for an extended period beyond standard rebooking terms The loss of change fee revenue combined with ongoing significant ticket cancellation activity has adversely impacted our revenues and liquidity We have also implemented significant cash preservation and cost reduction strategies in response to the impacts of COVID19 These strategies include but are not limited to capital expenditure reductions solicitation of voluntary short and longterm leaves of absence and renegotiation of contractual terms and conditions with vendors These measures while helpful in slowing the rate at which we utilize our cash are not expected to fully offset the loss of cash as a result of decreased ticket sales Further should we not be able to recall and provide training to those accepting longterm leaves of absence to provide staffing to match our expectations of capacity we may not be able to capitalize on the return of demand This may have a negative impact on our financial results At this time we are unable to predict what impact the pandemic will have on future customer behavior Future business travel may be impacted by widespread use of video conferencing or the reduction of business travel budgets Travelers may also be more reluctant in general to travel and the Company may need to expend significant resources to educate and demonstrate that air travel does not pose a health risk In addition the Company has incurred and will continue to incur COVID19 related costs for enhanced aircraft cleaning and additional procedures to limit transmission among employees and guests Although these procedures are elective the industry may be subject to mandated cleaning and safety measures in the future which may be costly and take a significant amount of time to implement Additionally the availability of COVID19 vaccines and the timing of inoculation in each state we serve will impact the willingness of the public to travel These contingencies individually and in the aggregate could have a material adverse impact on our business We have accepted certain conditions by accepting funding under the Payroll Support Program of the Coronavirus Aid Relief and Economic Security CARES Act The CARES Act was signed into law on March 27 2020 providing US airlines and related businesses the ability to access liquidity in the form of grants loans loan guarantees and other investments by the US government In 2020 the Company Alaska Horizon and McGee entered agreements with the United States Department of the Treasury Treasury to secure approximately 11 billion of funding under the CARES Act Payroll Support Program PSP of which 290 million is in the form of an unsecured senior term loan payable over ten years On January 15 2021 Alaska and Horizon finalized agreements with the Treasury and accepted partial disbursement of funds through an extended round of PSP funding made available under the Consolidated Appropriations Act 2021 PSP proceeds must be used exclusively for employee payroll and benefits expenses in accordance with the terms and conditions of the PSP agreements and the applicable provisions of the CARES Act Also in 2020 the Company and its airline subsidiaries entered agreements with the Treasury to obtain access to term loans of approximately 19 billion under the CARES Act loan program Funds drawn under the loan program must be secured with assets owned by Alaska or Horizon To date the Company has drawn 135 million from the loan facility and may at its option borrow additional amounts in up to two subsequent borrowings until May 28 2021 All proceeds must be used for general corporate purposes and operating expenses in accordance with the terms and conditions of the loan agreements and the applicable provisions of the CARES Act All borrowings are prepayable in whole or in part and are ultimately due and payable on September 26 2025 or March 28 2025 with respect to the portion of the loan if any secured with certain loyalty program assets In addition to repayment commitments we are subject to the following conditions under our CARES Act PSP and loan agreements  Alaska Horizon and McGee have to refrain from conducting involuntary furloughs or reducing employee rates of pay or benefits for nonofficer employees through March 31 2021 20  Alaska and Horizon may have to maintain DOTprescribed levels of air service to markets they served as of March 1 2020 through March 1 2022  The Company may not repurchase its common stock or pay dividends on its common stock until the later of March 31 2022 or one year after secured loan funds are repaid  The Company must meet minimum liquidity and collateral coverage ratio requirements until the secured loan funds are repaid  Compensation and severance payments for officers and employees who earned more than 425000 in total compensation in 2019 will be subject to maximum limitations through the later of October 1 2022 or one year after secured loan funds are repaid and  The Company must maintain certain internal controls and records and provide any additional reporting required by the US government relating to PSP and loan funding These conditions may adversely affect the Companys profitability our ability to negotiate favorable terms with loyalty partners our attractiveness to investors and our ability to compensate at marketcompetitive levels and retain key personnel SAFETY COMPLIANCE AND OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE Our reputation and financial results could be harmed in the event of an airline accident or incident An accident or incident involving one of our aircraft or an aircraft operated by one of our codeshare partners or CPA carriers could involve loss of life and result in a loss of confidence in our Company by the flying public andor aviation authorities We could experience significant claims from injured passengers bystanders and surviving relatives as well as costs for the repair or replacement of a damaged aircraft and temporary or permanent loss from service We maintain liability insurance in amounts and of the type generally consistent with industry practice as do our codeshare partners and CPA carriers However the amount of such coverage may not be adequate to fully cover all claims and we may be forced to bear substantial economic losses from such an event Substantial claims resulting from an accident in excess of our related insurance coverage would harm our business and financial results Moreover any aircraft accident or incident even if it is fully insured and does not involve one of our aircraft could cause a public perception that our airlines or the aircraft we or our partners fly are less safe or reliable than other transportation alternatives This would harm our business We announced plans to replace many of our Airbus aircraft with Boeing 737 MAX aircraft and in January 2021 we took delivery of our first MAX aircraft which is expected to enter revenue service in March 2021 Although the grounding of the aircraft was lifted in late 2020 following an extensive recertification process there is potential the traveling public may not trust the aircraft for safe operation As a result we may be required to expend significant resources in restoring guest confidence on the safe operation of the 737 MAX aircraft Failure to address guest confidence may negatively harm our business growth plans and results of operations Our operations are often affected by factors beyond our control including delays cancellations and other conditions which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations As is the case for all airlines our operations often are affected by delays cancellations and other conditions caused by factors largely beyond our control Factors that might impact our operations include  contagious illness and fear of contagion  congestion construction andor space constraints at airports specifically in our hub locations of Seattle Los Angeles and San Francisco  air traffic control problems  adverse weather conditions  lack of operational approval eg new routes aircraft deliveries etc 21  increased security measures or breaches in security  changes in international treaties concerning air rights  international or domestic conflicts or terrorist activity and  other changes in business conditions Due to the concentration of our flights in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska we believe a large portion of our operation is more susceptible to adverse weather conditions than other carriers A general reduction in airline passenger traffic as a result of any of the abovementioned factors could harm our business financial condition and results of operations Changes in government regulation imposing additional requirements and restrictions on our operations could increase our operating costs and result in service delays and disruptions Airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal requirements both domestically and internationally that require substantial compliance costs In the last several years Congress has passed laws and the US DOT the TSA and the FAA have issued regulations that have required significant expenditures relating to maintenance of aircraft operation of airlines and broadening of consumer protections As a result of the COVID19 pandemic we expect further regulation of onboard health and hygiene matters Similarly there are a number of legislative and regulatory initiatives and reforms at the federal state and local levels These initiatives include increasingly stringent laws to protect the environment minimum wage requirements mandatory paid sick or family leave and health care mandates These laws could affect our relationship with our workforce and the vendors that serve our airlines and cause our expenses to increase without an ability to pass through these costs New initiatives with employerfunded costs specifically those impacting Washington State could disproportionately increase our cost structure as compared to our competitors In recent years the airline industry has experienced an increase in litigation over the application of state and local employment laws particularly in California Application of these laws may result in operational disruption increased litigation risk and impact on negotiated labor agreements Additionally compliance with existing and future regulation around environmental laws including those involving aircraft emissions and environmental investigation and remediation costs could require significant expenditures or result in significant fines or penalties Almost all commercial service airports are owned andor operated by units of local or state governments Airlines are largely dependent on these governmental entities to provide adequate airport facilities and capacity at an affordable cost Many airports have increased their rates and charges to air carriers to reflect higher costs of security updates to infrastructure and other Additional laws regulations taxes airport rates and airport charges may be occasionally proposed that could significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce the demand for air travel Although lawmakers may impose these additional fees and view them as passthrough costs we believe that a higher total ticket price will influence consumer purchase and travel decisions and may result in an overall decline in passenger traffic which would harm our business Additionally changes in laws and regulations at the local level may be difficult to track and maintain compliance Any instances of noncompliance could result in additional fines and fees The airline industry continues to face potential security concerns and related costs Terrorist attacks the fear of such attacks or other hostilities involving the US could have a significant negative effect on the airline industry including us and could  significantly reduce passenger traffic and yields as a result of a dramatic drop in demand for air travel  significantly increase security and insurance costs  make war risk or other insurance unavailable or extremely expensive  increase fuel costs and the volatility of fuel prices  increase costs from airport shutdowns flight cancellations and delays resulting from security breaches and perceived safety threats and 22  result in a grounding of commercial air traffic by the FAA The occurrence of any of these events would harm our business financial condition and results of operations We rely on thirdparty vendors for certain critical activities which could expose us to disruptions in our operation or unexpected cost increases We rely on outside vendors for a variety of services and functions critical to our business including airframe and engine maintenance regional flying ground handling fueling computer reservation system hosting telecommunication systems information technology infrastructure and services and deicing among others Even though we strive to formalize agreements with these vendors that define expected service levels our use of outside vendors increases our exposure to several risks In the event that one or more vendors go into bankruptcy ceases operation or fails to perform as promised replacement services may not be readily available at competitive rates or at all If one of our vendors fails to perform adequately we may experience increased costs delays maintenance issues safety issues or negative public perception of our airline Vendor bankruptcies unionization regulatory compliance issues or significant changes in the competitive marketplace among suppliers could adversely affect vendor services or force us to renegotiate existing agreements on less favorable terms These events could result in disruptions in our operations or increases in our cost structure STRATEGY The airline industry is highly competitive and susceptible to price discounting and changes in capacity which could have a material adverse effect on our business If we cannot successfully compete in the marketplace our business financial condition and operating results will be materially adversely affected The US airline industry is characterized by substantial price competition In recent years the market share held by lowcost carriers and ultra lowcost carriers has increased significantly and is expected to continue to increase Airlines also compete for market share by increasing or decreasing their capacity route systems and the number of markets served Several of our competitors have increased their capacity in markets we serve particularly in our key West Coast markets This dynamic may be exacerbated by actions from airlines as we compete to attract passengers during the recovery from the COVID19 pandemic The resulting increased competition in both domestic and international markets may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition or liquidity We strive toward maintaining and improving our competitive cost structure by setting aggressive unit costreduction goals This is an important part of our business strategy of offering the best value to our guests through low fares while achieving acceptable profit margins and return on capital If we are unable to maintain our cost advantage over the longterm and achieve sustained targeted returns on invested capital we will likely not be able to grow our business in the future or weather industry downturns Therefore our financial results may suffer The airline industry may undergo further restructuring consolidation or the creation or modification of alliances or joint ventures any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations We continue to face strong competition from other carriers due to restructuring consolidation and the creation and modification of alliances and joint ventures Since deregulation both the US and international airline industries have experienced consolidation through a number of mergers and acquisitions Carriers may also improve their competitive positions through airline alliances slot swapsacquisitions andor joint ventures Certain airline joint ventures further competition by allowing airlines to coordinate routes pool revenues and costs and enjoy other mutual benefits achieving many of the benefits of consolidation Our concentration in certain markets could cause us to be disproportionately impacted by adverse changes in circumstances in those locations Our strategy includes being the premier carrier for people living on the West Coast This results in a high concentration of our business in key West Coast markets A significant portion of our flights occur to and from our Seattle Portland and Bay Area hubs In 2020 passengers to and from Seattle Portland and the Bay Area accounted for 84 of our total guests We believe that concentrating our service offerings in this way allows us to maximize our investment in personnel aircraft and ground facilities as well as to gain greater advantage from sales and marketing efforts in those regions As a result we remain highly dependent on our key markets Our business could be harmed by any circumstances causing a reduction in demand for 23 air transportation in our key markets An increase in competition in our key markets could also cause us to reduce fares or take other competitive measures that if sustained could harm our business financial condition and results of operations We are dependent on a limited number of suppliers for aircraft and parts Alaska is dependent on Boeing and Airbus as its sole suppliers for aircraft and many aircraft parts Horizon is similarly dependent on De Havilland and Embraer Additionally each carrier is dependent on sole suppliers for aircraft engines for each aircraft type As a result we are more vulnerable to issues associated with the supply of those aircraft and parts including design defects mechanical problems contractual performance by the manufacturers or adverse perception by the public that would result in customer avoidance or in actions by the FAA Should we be unable to resolve known issues with certain of our aircraft or engine suppliers it may result in the inability to operate our aircraft for extended periods Additionally if COVID19 causes our limited vendors to have performance problems reduced or ceased operations bankruptcies or other events causing them to be unable to fulfill their commitments to us our operations and business could be materially adversely affected Should these suppliers be unable to manufacture or deliver new aircraft we may not be able to grow our fleet at our intended rate which could impact our financial position Following the recertification of the 737 MAX aircraft Boeing has a significant production backlog which may impact the timing of deliveries We have 32 7379 MAX aircraft on order with 13 aircraft deliveries currently anticipated in 2021 If we are unable to receive these aircraft and future aircraft in a timely manner our growth plans could be significantly impacted Additionally further consolidation amongst aircraft and aircraft parts manufacturers could further limit the number of suppliers This could result in an inability to operate our aircraft or instability in the foreign countries in which the aircraft and its parts are manufactured We rely on partner airlines for codeshare and frequent flyer marketing arrangements Our airlines are parties to marketing agreements with a number of domestic and international air carriers or partners including the West Coast International Alliance WCIA with American which was announced in 2020 These agreements provide that certain flight segments operated by us are held out as partner codeshare flights and that certain partner flights are held out for sale as Alaska codeshare flights In addition the agreements generally provide that members of Alaskas Mileage Plan program can earn credit on or redeem credit for partner flights and vice versa We receive revenue from flights sold under codeshare and from interline arrangements In addition we believe that the frequent flyer arrangements are an important part of our loyalty program The loss of a significant partner through bankruptcy consolidation or otherwise could have a negative effect on our revenues or the attractiveness of our Mileage Plan program which we believe is a source of competitive advantage We routinely engage in analysis and discussions regarding our own strategic position including alliances codeshare arrangements interline arrangements and frequent flyer program enhancements and will continue to have future discussions with other airlines regarding similar activities If other airlines participate in consolidation or reorganization those airlines may significantly improve their cost structures or revenue generation capabilities thereby potentially making them stronger competitors of ours and potentially impairing our ability to realize expected benefits from our own strategic relationships Our impending entry into the one world global alliance is expected to provide us with many benefits including the ability to seamlessly connect our guests to more points around the globe as well as better serve corporate partners Entry into the alliance may cause us to lose existing codeshare agreements with partners who are not one world members and could limit options to bring non one world carrier partners into our Mileage Plan TM program Further maintaining the WCIA with another US airline may expose us to additional regulatory scrutiny Failure to appropriately manage these partnerships and alliances could negatively impact future growth plans and our financial position Economic uncertainty or another recession would likely impact demand for our product and could harm our financial condition and results of operations The airline industry which is subject to relatively high fixed costs and highly variable and unpredictable demand is particularly sensitive to changes in economic conditions We are also highly dependent on US consumer confidence and the health of the US economy Unfavorable US economic conditions have historically driven changes in travel patterns and have resulted in reduced spending for both leisure and business travel For some consumers leisure travel is a discretionary expense and shorter distance travelers in particular have the option to replace air travel with surface travel Businesses are able to forgo air travel by using communication alternatives such as video conferencing or may be more likely to purchase less expensive tickets to reduce costs which can result in a decrease in average revenue per seat Unfavorable economic conditions also hamper the ability of airlines to raise fares to counteract increased fuel labor and other costs Unfavorable or even uncertain economic conditions could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 24 INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY We rely heavily on automated systems to operate our business and a failure to invest in new technology or a disruption of our current systems or their operators could harm our business We depend on automated systems to operate our business including our airline reservation system our telecommunication systems our website our maintenance systems our checkin kiosks mobile devices and other systems Substantially all of our tickets are issued to our guests as electronic tickets and the majority of our guests checkin using our website airport kiosks or our mobile application We depend on our reservation system to be able to issue track and accept these electronic tickets In order for our operations to work efficiently we must continue to invest in new technology to ensure that our website reservation system and checkin systems are able to accommodate a high volume of traffic maintain information security and deliver important flight information Substantial or repeated website reservations system or telecommunication systems failures or service disruptions could reduce the attractiveness of our services and cause our guests to do business with another airline In addition we rely on other automated systems for crew scheduling flight dispatch and other operational needs Disruptions failed migration untimely recovery or a breach of these systems or our data center could result in the loss of important data an increase of our expenses an impact on our operational performance or a possible temporary cessation of our operations Failure to appropriately comply with information security rules and regulations or safeguard our employee or guest data could result in damage to our reputation and cause us to incur substantial legal and regulatory cost We accept store and transmit information about our guests our employees our business partners and our business Many international and US jurisdictions have established or are in the process of establishing their own data security and privacy regulatory framework with which we our business partners and our corporate customers must comply There are also various bills pending at the US state and federal levels that could impose additional privacy and data security obligations This uncertain and increasingly complex regulatory environment may result in significant expenses associated with increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes particularly as we continue to collect and retain large amounts of personal information If our online activities or our other customerfacing technology systems do not function as designed we may experience a loss of customer confidence decreased sales or be exposed to fraud any of which could materially and adversely affect our reputation and operations In addition we frequently rely on thirdparty hosting sites and data processors including cloud providers To the extent that either we or third parties with whom we share information are found to be out of compliance with applicable laws and regulations we could be subject to additional litigation regulatory risks and reputational harm Cyber security threats have and will continue to impact our business Failure to appropriately mitigate these risks could negatively impact our operations onboard safety reputation and financial condition Our sensitive information is securely transmitted over public and private networks Our systems are subject to increasing and evolving cyber security risks Unauthorized parties have attempted and continue to attempt to gain access to our systems and information including through fraudulent misrepresentation and other means of deception Methods used by unauthorized parties are continually evolving and may be difficult to identify Because of these everevolving risks and regular attacks we continue to review policies and educate our people on various methods utilized in attempts to gain unauthorized access to bolster awareness and encourage cautionary practices However the nature of these attacks means that proper policies and education may not be enough to prevent all unauthorized access A compromise of our systems the security of our infrastructure or those of other business partners that result in our information being accessed or stolen by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our operations and our reputation A cybersecurity attack impacting our onboard or other operational systems may result in an accident or incident onboard or significant operational disruptions which could adversely affect our reputation operation and financial position Further a significant portion of our office employees have transitioned to remote work which could increase our potential exposure to cyberattacks and could compromise our financial or operational systems FINANCIAL CONDITION AND FINANCIAL MARKETS Our business financial condition and results of operations are substantially exposed to the volatility of jet fuel prices Significant increases in jet fuel costs would harm our business Fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our total operating expenses Future increases in the price of jet fuel may harm our business financial condition and results of operations unless we are able to increase fares and fees or add additional ancillary services to attempt to recover increasing fuel costs 25 We have a significant amount of debt and fixed obligations and have incurred substantial incremental debt in response to the COVID19 pandemic These obligations could lead to liquidity restraints and have a material adverse effect on our financial position We carry and will continue to carry for the foreseeable future a substantial amount of debt and aircraft operating lease commitments In response to the COVID19 pandemic we have incurred and may continue to seek new financing sources to fund our operations while demand remains at an unprecedented low level and for the unknown duration of any economic recovery period Although we aim to keep our leverage low due to our high fixed costs including aircraft lease commitments and debt service a decrease in revenues would result in a disproportionately greater decrease in earnings Our outstanding longterm debt and other fixed obligations could have important consequences For example they could limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our future capital expenditures working capital or other purposes require us to dedicate a material portion of our operating cash flow to fund lease payments and interest payments on indebtedness thereby reducing funds available for other purposes or limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions Further as we incur incremental obligations issuers may require future debt agreements to contain more restrictive covenants or require additional collateral beyond historical market terms which may further restrict our ability to successfully access capital Although we have historically been able to generate sufficient cash flow from our operations to pay our debt and other fixed obligations when they become due we cannot ensure we will be able to do so in the future If we fail to do so our business could be harmed Our maintenance costs will increase as our fleet ages and we will periodically incur substantial maintenance costs due to the timing of maintenance events of our aircraft As of December 31 2020 the average age of our NextGen aircraft B737700 800 900 900ERs was approximately 99 years the average age of our operating A320 and A321neo aircraft was approximately 72 years the average age of our owned E175 aircraft was approximately 26 years and the average age of our Q400 aircraft was approximately 127 years Typically our newer aircraft require less maintenance than they will in the future Any significant increase in maintenance expenses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations In addition expenses for aircraft coming off lease could result in unplanned maintenance expense as we are required to return leased planes in a contractually specified condition The application of the acquisition method of accounting resulted in us recording a significant amount of goodwill which could result in significant future impairment charges and negatively affect our financial results In accordance with acquisition accounting rules we recorded goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet to the extent the Virgin America acquisition purchase price exceeded the net fair value of Virgin Americas tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually We could record impairment charges in our results of operations as a result of among other items extreme fuel price volatility a significant decline in the fair value of certain tangible or intangible assets unfavorable trends in forecasted results of operations and cash flows uncertain economic environment and other uncertainties We can provide no assurance that a significant impairment charge will not occur in one or more future periods Any such charges may materially affect our financial results BRAND AND REPUTATION As we evolve our brand to appeal to a changing demographic and grow into new markets we will engage in strategic initiatives that may not be favorably received by all of our guests We continue to focus on strategic initiatives designed to increase our brand appeal to a diverse and evolving demographic of airline travelers These efforts could include significant enhancements to our inairport and onboard environments increasing our direct customer relationships through improvements to our purchasing portals digital and mobile and optimization of our customer loyalty programs In pursuit of these efforts we may negatively affect our reputation with some of our existing customer base 26 The Companys brand and reputation could be harmed if it is exposed to significant negative publicity distributed through social media We operate in a highly visible industry that has significant exposure to social media Negative publicity including as a result of misconduct by our guests or employees or failure to adhere to COVID19 related health and safety protocols can spread rapidly through social media Should the Company not respond in a timely and appropriate manner to address negative publicity the Companys brand and reputation may be significantly harmed Such harm could have a negative impact on our financial results LABOR RELATIONS AND LABOR STRATEGY A significant increase in labor costs unsuccessful attempts to strengthen our relationships with union employees or loss of key personnel could adversely affect our business and results of operations Labor costs remain a significant component of our total expenses In addition to costs associated with represented employee groups labor costs could also increase for nonunionized employees and via vendor agreements as we work to compete for highly skilled and qualified employees against the major US airlines and other businesses in a thriving job market Although ample efforts have been dedicated to rightsizing our management structure following the merger with Virgin America these increased labor costs may adversely affect our financial performance Should employees engage in job actions such as slowdowns sickouts or other actions designed to disrupt normal operations and pressure the employer to acquiesce to bargaining demands during Section 6 negotiations although unlawful until after lengthy mediation attempts the operation could be significantly impacted Although we have a long track record of fostering good communications negotiating approaches and developing other strategies to enhance workforce engagement in our longterm vision unsuccessful attempts to strengthen relationships with union employees or loss of key personnel could divert managements attention from other projects and issues which could adversely affect our business and results of operations The inability to attract retain and train qualified personnel or maintain our culture could result in guest impacts and adversely affect our business and results of operations We compete against other major US airlines for pilots aircraft technicians and other skilled labor As more pilots in the industry approach mandatory retirement age the US airline industry may be affected by a pilot shortage Attrition beyond normal levels the inability to attract new pilots or our key vendors inability to attract and retain mechanics or other skilled labor positions could negatively impact our operating results As a result our business prospects could be harmed Additionally we may be required to increase our wage and benefit packages or pay increased rates to our vendors to retain these positions This would result in increased overall costs and may adversely impact our financial position Our success is also dependent on cultivating and maintaining a unified culture with cohesive values and goals Much of our continued success is tied to our guest loyalty Failure to maintain and grow the Alaska culture could strain our ability to maintain relationships with guests suppliers employees and other constituencies As part of this process we may continue to incur substantial costs for employee programs 27 REGULATION Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for most legal actions involving actions brought against us by stockholders which could limit our stockholders ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors officers or other employees Our certificate of incorporation provides that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for i any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of our company ii any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors officers or other employees or our stockholders iii any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or the DGCL or as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction to the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or iv any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine This exclusive forum provision is intended to apply to claims arising under Delaware state law and would not apply to claims brought pursuant to the Exchange Act or the Securities Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction The exclusive forum provision in our certificate of incorporation will not relieve us of our duties to comply with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder and our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with these laws rules and regulations This exclusive forum provision may limit a stockholders ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or our directors officers or other employees which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors officers and other employees In addition stockholders who do bring a claim in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware could face additional litigation costs in pursuing any such claim particularly if they do not reside in or near Delaware The Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware may also reach different judgments or results than would other courts including courts where a stockholder would otherwise choose to bring the action and such judgments or results may be more favorable to our company than to our stockholders ITEM 1B UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None ITEM 2

2022 and 2023 The leased E175 aircraft support our capacity purchase agreement with SkyWest which extends through 2030 Alaska has the option to extend some of the leases for additional periods GROUND FACILITIES AND SERVICES In various cities in the state of Alaska we own terminal buildings and two multibay hangars We also own several buildings located at or near SeattleTacoma International Airport SeaTac These include a multibay hangar and shops complex used primarily for line maintenance a flight operations and training center an air cargo facility an information technology office and data center and various other commercial office buildings Additionally in 2020 we opened our newest corporate office building in SeaTac The Hub At the majority of the airports we serve we lease ticket counters gates cargo and baggage space ground equipment office space and other support areas Airport leases contain provisions for periodic adjustments of lease rates We are typically responsible for maintenance insurance and other facilityrelated expenses and services under these agreements We also lease operations training administrative and data center facilities in Burlingame CA Portland OR Quincy WA and Spokane WA line maintenance stations in Boise ID San Jose CA Redmond OR Seattle WA Kent WA and Spokane WA and call center facilities in Phoenix AZ and Boise ID and a multibay hangar in Portland OR ITEM 3 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS The Company is a party to routine litigation matters incidental to its business and with respect to which no material liability is expected Liabilities for litigation related contingencies are recorded when a loss is determined to be probable and estimable In 2015 three flight attendants filed a class action lawsuit seeking to represent all Virgin America flight attendants for damages based on alleged violations of California and City of San Francisco wage and hour laws The court certified a class of approximately 1800 flight attendants in November 2016 The Company believes the claims in this case are without factual and legal merit In July 2018 the Court granted in part Plaintiffs motion for summary judgment finding Virgin America and Alaska Airlines as a successorininterest to Virgin America responsible for various damages and penalties sought by the class members In February 2019 the Court entered final judgment against Virgin America and Alaska Airlines in the amount of approximately 78 million It did not award injunctive relief against Alaska Airlines In February 2021 an appellate court reversed portions of the lower court decision and significantly reduced the judgment The determination of total judgment has not been completed as of the date of this fili ng Based on the facts and circumstances available the Company believes the range of potential loss to be between 0 and 78 million The Company has recorded an estimate of the loss within this range in the financial statements for the period ending December 31 2020 as a recognized subsequent event The Company is seeking an appellate court ruling that the California laws on which the judgment is based are invalid as applied to national airlines pursuant to the US Constitution and federal law and for other employment law and improper class certification reasons The Company remains confident that a higher court will respect the federal preemption principles that were enacted to shield interstate common carriers from a patchwork of state and local wage and hour regulations such as those at issue in this case and agree with the Companys other bases for appeal In January 2019 a pilot filed a class action lawsuit seeking to represent all Alaska and Horizon pilots for damages based on alleged violations of the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act USERRA Plaintiff received class certification in August 2020 The case is in discovery The Company believes the claims in the case are without factual and legal merit and intends to defend the lawsuit The Company is involved in other litigation around the application of state and local employment laws like many air carriers Our defenses are similar to those identified above including that the state and local laws are preempted by federal law and are unconstitutional because they impede interstate commerce None of these additional disputes are material 29 This forwardlooking statement is based on managements current understanding of the relevant laws and facts and it is subject to various contingencies including the potential costs and risks associated with litigation and the actions of judges and juries ITEM 4 MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES Not applicable PART II
