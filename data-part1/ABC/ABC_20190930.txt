PART I ITEM 1 BUSINESS As used herein the terms Company AmerisourceBergen we us or our refer to AmerisourceBergen Corporation a Delaware corporation AmerisourceBergen is one of the largest global pharmaceutical sourcing and distribution services companies helping both healthcare providers and pharmaceutical and biotech manufacturers improve patient access to products and enhance patient care We deliver innovative programs and services designed to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the pharmaceutical supply chain in both human and animal health More specifically we distribute a comprehensive offering of brandname specialty brandname and generic pharmaceuticals overthecounter healthcare products home healthcare supplies and equipment outsourced compounded sterile preparations

pharmacies mail order pharmacies medical clinics longterm care and alternate site pharmacies physician practices medical and dialysis clinics veterinarians and other customers Additionally we furnish healthcare providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers with an assortment of related services including data analytics outcomes research reimbursement and pharmaceutical consulting services niche premium logistics services inventory management pharmacy automation pharmacy management and packaging solutions Industry Overview Pharmaceutical sales in the United States as recently estimated by IQVIA an independent thirdparty provider of information to the pharmaceutical and healthcare industry are expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 42 from 2018 through 2023 and the growth rate is dependent in part on pharmaceutical manufacturer price increases In addition to general economic conditions factors that impact the growth of the pharmaceutical industry in the United States and other industry trends include Aging Population The number of individuals age 65 and over in the United States is expected to exceed 61 million by 2023 and is the most rapidly growing segment of the population This age group suffers from more chronic illnesses and disabilities than the rest of the population and accounts for a substantial portion of total healthcare expenditures in the United States Introduction of New Pharmaceuticals Traditional research and development as well as the advent of new research production and delivery methods such as biotechnology and gene therapy continue to generate new pharmaceuticals and delivery methods that are more effective in treating diseases We believe ongoing research and development expenditures by the leading pharmaceutical manufacturers will contribute to continued growth of the industry In particular we believe ongoing research and development of biotechnology and other specialty pharmaceutical drugs will provide opportunities for the continued growth of our specialty pharmaceuticals business Increased Use of Generic Pharmaceuticals A number of patents for widely used brandname pharmaceutical products will continue to expire during the next several years In addition increased emphasis by managed care and other thirdparty payors on utilization of generics has accelerated their growth We consider the increase in generic usage a favorable trend because generic pharmaceuticals have historically provided us with a greater gross profit margin opportunity than brandname products although their lower prices reduce revenue growth Generic pharmaceuticals currently account for approximately 90 of the prescription volume in the United States Increased Use of Drug Therapies In response to rising healthcare costs governmental and private payors have adopted cost containment measures that encourage the use of efficient drug therapies to prevent or treat diseases While national attention has been focused on the overall increase in aggregate healthcare costs we believe drug therapy has had a beneficial impact on healthcare costs by reducing expensive surgeries and prolonged hospital stays Pharmaceuticals currently account for approximately 11 of overall healthcare costs Pharmaceutical manufacturers continued emphasis on research and development is expected to result in the continuing introduction of costeffective drug therapies and new uses for existing drug therapies 1 Table of Contents Legislative Developments In 2010 the federal government enacted major health reform legislation designed to expand access to health insurance which increased the number of people in the United States who are eligible to be reimbursed for all or a portion of prescription drug costs The health reform law provides for sweeping changes to Medicare and Medicaid policies including drug reimbursement policies expanded disclosure requirements regarding financial arrangements within the healthcare industry enhanced enforcement authority to prevent fraud and abuse and new taxes and fees on pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers These policies and other legislative developments including potential revisions to or repeal of any portions of the health reform legislation may affect our businesses directly andor indirectly see Government Regulation on page 6 for further details Other economic conditions and certain risk factors could adversely affect our business and prospects see Item 1A Risk Factors on page 8 The Company We serve our customers healthcare

entitywide infrastructure environment to drive efficiency capabilities and speed to market We will continue to invest in advanced information systems and automated warehouse technology For example in an effort to comply with future pedigree and other supply chain custody requirements see Risk Factor  Increasing governmental efforts to regulate the pharmaceutical supply channel and pharmaceutical compounding may increase our costs and reduce our profitability  we expect to continue to make significant investments in our secure supply chain information systems Pharmaceutical Distribution

systems which are used to manage the majority of Pharmaceutical Distribution Services transactional volume The warehouse operating systems have improved Pharmaceutical Distribution Services productivity and operating leverage A significant portion of our data center operations which were previously outsourced to thirdparty providers is now insourced Competition We face a highly competitive global environment in the distribution of pharmaceuticals and related healthcare services Our largest competitors are McKesson Corporation McKesson Cardinal Health Inc Cardinal FFF Enterprises Henry Schein Inc and UPS Logistics among others Pharmaceutical Distribution Services competes with both McKesson and Cardinal as well as national generic distributors and regional distributors within pharmaceutical distribution In addition we compete with manufacturers who sell directly to customers chain drugstores who manage their own warehousing specialty distributors and packaging and healthcare technology companies ABCS World Courier and MWI also face competition from a variety of businesses In all areas competitive factors include price product offerings valueadded service programs service and delivery credit terms and customer support Intellectual Property We use a number of trademarks and service marks All of the principal trademarks and service marks used in the course of our business have been registered in the United States and in some cases in foreign jurisdictions or are the subject of pending applications for registration We have developed or acquired various proprietary products processes software and other intellectual property that are used either to facilitate the conduct of our business or that are made available as products or services to customers We generally seek to protect such intellectual property through a combination of trade secret patent and copyright laws and through confidentiality and other contractually imposed protections We hold patents and have patent applications pending that relate to certain of our products particularly our automated pharmacy dispensing equipment our medication and supply dispensing equipment certain warehousing equipment and some of our proprietary packaging solutions We seek patent protection for our proprietary intellectual property from time to time as appropriate

against us from time to time Employees As of September 30 2019  we had approximately 22000 employees of which approximately 21000 were fulltime employees Approximately 2 of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements We believe that our relationship with our employees is good If any of our employees in locations that are unionized should engage in strikes or other such bargaining tactics in connection with the negotiation of new collective bargaining agreements upon the expiration of any existing collective bargaining agreements such tactics could be disruptive to our operations and adversely affect our results of operations However we believe we have adequate contingency plans in place to assure delivery of pharmaceuticals to our customers in the event of any such disruptions 5 Table of Contents Government Regulation We are subject to extensive oversight by various federal and state governmental entities and we are subject to and affected by a variety of federal and state laws regulations and policies The US Drug Enforcement Administration DEA the US Food and Drug Administration FDA the US Department of Justice DOJ and various other federal and state authorities regulate the compounding purchase storage andor distribution of pharmaceutical products including controlled substances Wholesale distributors of controlled substances and entities that compound pharmaceuticals that contain controlled substances must hold valid DEA licenses meet various security and operating standards and comply with regulations governing the sale marketing compounding packaging holding and distribution of controlled substances Our Section 503B outsourcing facilities must comply with current Good Manufacturing Practices cGMPs and are inspected by the FDA periodically to determine that we are complying with such cGMPs DEA FDA DOJ and state authorities have broad enforcement powers including the ability to suspend our distribution centers or Section 503B outsourcing facilities from distributing pharmaceutical products including controlled substances seize or recall products and impose significant criminal civil and administrative sanctions On May 17 2019 PharMEDium Healthcare Holdings Inc PharMEDium reached an agreement on the terms of a consent decree the Consent Decree with the FDA and the Consumer Protection Branch of the Civil Division of the DOJ that was entered by the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois on May 22 2019 The Consent Decree permits commercial operations to continue at PharMEDiums Dayton New Jersey and Sugar Land Texas compounding facilities and administrative operations to continue at its Lake Forest Illinois headquarters subject to compliance with the requirements of the Consent Decree As required by the Consent Decree we have completed audit inspections by an independent cGMP expert at the Dayton and Sugar Land facilities to confirm that the facilities are being operated in conformity with cGMP Additional audit inspections by the independent cGMP expert of the Sugar Land and Dayton facilities are also required at least annually for four years The Consent Decree also establishes requirements that must be satisfied prior to the resumption of commercial operations at the Memphis Tennessee facility where we voluntarily suspended production activities in December 2017 We continue the ongoing compliance efforts of our subsidiary PharMEDium including efforts to resume commercial distribution at the Memphis Tennessee facility We and our customers are subject to fraud and abuse laws including the federal antikickback statute and False Claims Act The antikickback statute prohibits persons from soliciting offering receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the purchasing leasing or ordering induce a referral to purchase lease or order or arrange for or recommend purchasing leasing or ordering items or services that are in any way paid for by Medicare Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs The False Claims Act prohibits knowingly submitting or causing the submission of false or fraudulent claims for payment to the government and authorizes treble damages and substantial civil penalties in the case of violations The fraud and abuse laws and regulations are broad in scope and are subject to frequent and varied interpretation In recent years some states have passed or proposed laws and regulations that are intended to protect the safety of the pharmaceutical supply channel These laws and regulations are designed to prevent the introduction of counterfeit diverted adulterated or mislabeled pharmaceuticals into the distribution system At the federal level the supply chain security legislation known as the Drug Quality and Security Act DQSA became law in 2013 The DQSA establishes federal traceability standards requiring drugs to be labeled and tracked at the lot level preempts state drug pedigree requirements and will eventually require all supplychain stakeholders to participate in an electronic interoperable prescription drug traceability system The DQSA also establishes new requirements for drug wholesale distributors and thirdparty logistics providers including licensing requirements applicable in states that had not previously licensed thirdparty logistics providers We expect that the FDA and eventually comparable state agencies will promulgate implementing regulations governing wholesale distributor and thirdparty logistics providers In addition the DQSA created 503B outsourcing facilities as a new category for providers of compounded sterile preparations CSPs allowing such facilities to voluntarily register with the FDA Our CSP business locations have registered with the FDA as Section 503B outsourcing facilities and have implemented policies and procedures to achieve compliance with current federal and state requirements for such facilities There can be no assurance that we are fully compliant with the new DQSA requirements or with additional related state regulatory and licensing requirements and any failure to comply may result in suspension or delay of certain operations and additional costs to bring our operations into compliance These and other requirements will continue to increase the cost of our operations The regulation of public and private health insurance and benefit programs can also affect our business and scrutiny of the healthcare delivery and reimbursement systems in the United States can be expected to continue at both the state and federal levels This process may result in additional legislation andor regulation governing the production delivery or pricing of pharmaceutical products and other healthcare services In addition changes in the interpretations of existing regulations may result in significant additional compliance costs or the discontinuation of our ability to continue to operate our distribution centers or Section 503B outsourcing facilities which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 6 Table of Contents Any future reductions in Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement rates could negatively impact our customers businesses and their ability to continue to purchase drugs from us We cannot predict what additional initiatives if any will be adopted when they may be adopted or what impact they may have on us We are subject to various federal state and local environmental laws including with respect to the sale transportation storage handling and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances as well as laws relating to safe working conditions and laboratory practices The costs burdens andor impacts of complying with federal and state regulations could be significant and the failure to comply with any such legal requirements could have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial condition See Risk Factors beginning on page 8 for a discussion of additional legal and regulatory developments as well as enforcement actions or other litigation that may arise out of our failure to adequately comply with applicable laws and regulations that may negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition Health Information and Privacy Practices The Health Information Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 HIPAA and its implementing regulations set forth privacy and security standards designed to protect the privacy of and provide for the security of protected health information as defined under the HIPAA regulations Some of our businesses collect maintain andor access protected health information and are subject to the HIPAA regulations Our operations depending on their location may also be subject to state or foreign regulations affecting personal data protection and the manner in which information services or products are provided Significant criminal and civil penalties may be imposed for violation of HIPAA standards and other such laws We have a HIPAA compliance program to facilitate our ongoing efforts to comply with the HIPAA regulations The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act HITECH Act enacted as part of the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act ARRA strengthened federal privacy and security provisions governing protected health information Among other things the HITECH Act expanded certain aspects of the HIPAA privacy and security rules imposed new notification requirements related to health data security breaches broadened the rights of the US Department of Health and Human Services HHS to enforce HIPAA and directed HHS to publish more specific security standards On January 25 2013 the Office for Civil Rights of HHS published the HIPAA omnibus final rule HIPAA Final Rule which amended certain aspects of the HIPAA privacy security and enforcement rules pursuant to the HITECH Act extending certain HIPAA obligations to business associates and their subcontractors Certain components of our business act as business associates within the meaning of HIPAA and are subject to these additional obligations under the HIPAA Final Rule Some of our businesses collect maintain andor access other personal information including sensitive personal information that is subject to federal and state laws protecting such information in addition to the requirements of HIPAA the HITECH Act and the implementing regulations Personally identifiable information is also highly regulated in many other countries in which we operate As such regulations continue to evolve we must comply with applicable privacy and security requirements of these countries including but not limited to those in the European Union Most notably certain aspects of our business are subject to the European Unions General Data Protection Regulation GDPR which became effective on May 25 2018 and the recently enacted California Consumer Protection Act CCPA which becomes effective on January 1 2020 with the promulgation of regulations due to be released on July 1 2020 We have implemented a privacy and information security compliance program to facilitate our ongoing efforts to comply with GDPR CCPA and other applicable privacy regulations There can be no assurances that compliance with these requirements will not impose new costs on our business Available Information For more information about us visit our website at wwwamerisourcebergencom  The contents of the website are not part of this Form 10K Our electronic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission including all Forms 10K 10Q and 8K and any amendments to these reports are available free of charge through our website at investoramerisourcebergencom immediately after we electronically file with or furnish them to the Securities and Exchange Commission and may also be viewed using their website at wwwsecgov  7 Table of Contents ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS The following discussion describes certain risk factors that we believe could affect our business and prospects These risk factors are in addition to those set forth elsewhere in this report Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider not to be material The reader should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all risks and uncertainties Our results of operations could be adversely impacted by manufacturer pricing changes In fiscal 2019 we continued to experience unfavorable brand and generic pharmaceutical pricing trends which negatively impacted our Pharmaceutical Distribution Services reportable segment profit and our consolidated operating earnings We expect these trends to continue in fiscal 2020 which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations Our contractual arrangements with pharmaceutical manufacturers for the purchase of brand pharmaceutical products generally use wholesale acquisition cost WAC as the reference price We sell brand pharmaceutical products to many of our customers using WAC as the reference price and to other customers based on their negotiated contract price If manufacturers change their pricing policies or practices with regard to WAC or if prices charged by manufacturers do not align with prices negotiated to be paid by our customers and we are unable to negotiate alternative ways to be compensated by manufacturers or customers for the value of our services our results of operations could be adversely affected Additionally there are a number of policy initiatives being considered which if enacted could directly or indirectly regulate or impact WAC list prices If such initiatives are passed and we are unable to negotiate equitable changes with our suppliers andor customers our results of operations could be adversely impacted The pharmaceutical products that we purchase are also subject to price inflation and deflation Additionally certain distribution service agreements that we have entered into with brand and generic pharmaceutical manufacturers have a price appreciation component to them As a result our gross profit from brandname and generic pharmaceuticals continues to be subject to fluctuation based upon the timing and extent of manufacturer price increases which we do not control If the frequency or rate of brand and generic pharmaceutical price increases slows whether due to regulatory mandates the implementation of legislative proposals policy initiatives or voluntary manufacturer actions our results of operations could be adversely affected In addition generic pharmaceuticals are also subject to price deflation If the frequency or rate of generic pharmaceutical price deflation accelerates the negative impact on our results of operations will be greater Competition and industry consolidation may erode our profit As described in greater detail in the Competition section beginning on page 5 the industries in which we operate are highly competitive In addition in recent years the healthcare industry has been subject to increasing consolidation including among pharmaceutical manufacturers retail pharmacies and health insurers which may create further competitive pressures on our pharmaceutical distribution business If we do not compete successfully it could have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations The impact on us will be greater if consolidation among our customers suppliers and competitors gives the resulting enterprises greater bargaining power which could lead to greater pressure on us to reduce prices for our products and services Increasing governmental efforts to regulate the pharmaceutical supply channel and pharmaceutical compounding may increase our costs and reduce our profitability The healthcare industry in the United States is highly regulated at the federal and state levels There have been increasing efforts by Congress and state and federal agencies including state boards of pharmacy departments of health and the FDA to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system and pharmacy compounding activities Regulation of pharmaceutical distribution is intended to prevent diversion and the introduction of counterfeit adulterated andor mislabeled drugs into the pharmaceutical distribution system Consequently we are subject to the risk of changes in various federal and state laws which include operating and security standards of the DEA the FDA various state boards of pharmacy and comparable agencies In recent years some states have passed or proposed laws and regulations that are intended to protect the safety and security of the supply channel but that also may substantially increase the costs and burden of pharmaceutical distribution and pharmaceutical compounding At the federal level the DQSA establishes federal traceability standards requiring drugs to be labeled and tracked at the bottle level preempts state drug pedigree requirements and will require all supplychain stakeholders to participate in an electronic interoperable prescription drug traceability system by November 2023 The DQSA also established requirements for drug wholesale distributors and thirdparty logistics providers including licensing requirements applicable in states that had not previously licensed thirdparty logistics providers In addition the DQSA established 503B outsourcing facilities as a category for providers of CSPs allowing such facilities to voluntarily register with the FDA Our CSP business locations have registered with the FDA as 503B 8 Table of Contents outsourcing facilities and have implemented policies and procedures to achieve compliance with current federal and state requirements for such facilities There can be no assurance that we are fully compliant with the DQSA requirements or with additional related state regulatory and licensing requirements and any failure to comply may result in suspension or delay of certain operations and additional costs to bring our facilities into compliance Moreover we expect that the FDA will continue to issue draft and final guidance and to promulgate regulations in its efforts to implement the requirements in the DQSA including those relating to current good manufacturing practices cGMPs and other matters related to 503B outsourcing facilities which may require changes to our business some of which may be significant Additional details on risks related to our 503B outsourcing facilities and implementation of cGMPs are described below As discussed in the risk factor below about public concern over the abuse of opioid medications certain governmental and regulatory agencies as well as state and local jurisdictions are focused on the abuse of opioid medications in the United States In addition to conducting investigations and participating in litigation related to the misuse of prescription opioid medications federal state and local governmental and regulatory agencies are considering legislation and regulatory measures to limit opioid prescriptions and more closely monitor product distribution prescribing and dispensing of these drugs Complying with the DQSA requirements and other chain of custody and pharmaceutical distribution and compounding requirements including followon actions related to current public concern over the abuse of opioid medications could result in suspension or delays in our production and distribution activities which may increase our costs and could otherwise adversely affect our results of operations Legal regulatory and legislative changes with respect to reimbursement pricing and contracting may adversely affect our business and results of operations including through declining reimbursement rates Both our business and our customers businesses may be adversely affected by laws and regulations reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals andor medical treatments or services changing the methodology by which reimbursement levels are determined or regulating pricing contracting and discounting practices with respect to medical products and services Additionally on occasion price increases and pricing practices with respect to certain brand and generic pharmaceuticals have been the subject of US Congressional inquiries federal and state investigations and private litigation Any law or regulation impacting pharmaceutical pricing or reimbursement such as pricing controls or indexing models at the federal or state level could adversely affect our operations Federal insurance and healthcare reform legislation known as the Affordable Care Act ACA became law in March 2010 and included numerous reforms broadening healthcare access and affecting Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement pricing and contracting for prescription drugs including changes to the Medicaid rebate statute Given the scope of the changes made by the ACA and continuing implementation controversies we cannot predict the impact of every aspect of the law on our operations Likewise we cannot predict the impact of any efforts to change or repeal any provisions of the ACA may have on the ACA or other healthcare legislation and regulation Subsequent legislation has made additional changes to federal drug payment policies including the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 which increased the Medicaid rebate due with respect to line extensions of single source or innovator multiple source oral solid dosage form drugs The federal government and state governments could take other actions in the future that impact Medicaid reimbursement and rebate amounts or the cost of drugs Any reduction in the Medicaid reimbursement rates to our customers may indirectly impact the prices that we can charge our customers for multiple source pharmaceuticals and cause corresponding declines in our profitability There can be no assurance that recent or future changes in Medicaid prescription drug reimbursement policies will not have an adverse impact on our business Unless we are able to successfully advocate to prevent or mitigate the impact of these legislative and regulatory changes these changes in reimbursement and related reporting requirements could adversely affect our results of operations Our businesses also sell specialty and other drugs to physicians hospitals community oncology practices and other providers that are reimbursed under Part B of the Medicare program The Centers of Medicare  Medicaid Services CMS published a final rule on November 13 2017 that reduces Medicare outpatient hospital reimbursement for separately payable drugs other than vaccines purchased through the 340B drug discount program from average sales price ASP plus 6 to ASP minus 225 with certain exceptions effective January 1 2018 On December 27 2018 the United States District Court for the District of Columbia concluded that this policy exceeded CMS statutory authority with regard to 2018 payments While the appeals process is still underway CMS solicited comments in the proposed calendar year 2020 Medicare outpatient prospective payment system rule on appropriate payment for such 340Bacquired drugs potentially including a reduced rate of ASP plus 3 9 Table of Contents for calendar years 2018 through 2020 Separately on November 21 2018 CMS published a final rule that reduces from 6 to 3 the addon payment for new separatelypayable Part B drugs and biologicals that are paid based on WAC when ASP data during first quarter or sales is unavailable The federal government may adopt measures in the future that would further reduce Medicare andor Medicaid spending or impose additional requirements on healthcare entities Notably the Trump Administration and members of Congress proposed numerous amendments to Part B drug distribution and payment models during 2018 and have continued to do so throughout 2019 Some of these proposals could have significant effects on our business including a potential proposal to create an International Pricing Index payment model that would modify distribution methods for Part B drugs and tie reimbursement rates to international drug pricing metrics Any future reductions in Medicare reimbursement rates or modifications to Medicare drug pricing regulations such as ASP calculations could negatively impact our customers businesses and their ability to continue to purchase such drugs from us or could indirectly affect the structure of our relationships with manufacturers and our customers At this time we can provide no assurances that future Medicare andor Medicaid payment or policy changes if adopted would not have a material adverse effect on our business Finally federal and state governments may adopt policies affecting drug pricing and contracting practices outside of the context of federal programs such as Medicare and Medicaid which may adversely affect our business For example several states have adopted laws that require drug manufacturers to provide advance notice of certain price increases and to report information relating to those price increases while others have taken legislative or administrative action to establish prescription drug affordability boards or multipayer purchasing pools to reduce the cost of prescription drugs On July 31 2019 the Department of Health and Human Services announced a Safe Importation Action Plan that outlines two potential pathways to allow importation of certain drugs from foreign markets There can be no assurances that future changes to drug reimbursement policies drug pricing and contracting practices outside of federal healthcare programs or to government drug price regulation programs such as the Medicaid rebate ASP or 340B program will not have an adverse impact on our business If we fail to comply with laws and regulations in respect of healthcare fraud and abuse we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations We are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal and state laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud and abuse The federal government continues to strengthen its scrutiny of practices potentially involving healthcare fraud affecting Medicare Medicaid and other government healthcare programs Our relationships with healthcare providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers subject our business to laws and regulations on fraud and abuse which among other things i prohibit persons from soliciting offering receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient for treatment or the ordering or purchasing of items or services that are in any way paid for by Medicare Medicaid or other governmentsponsored healthcare programs and ii impose a number of restrictions upon referring physicians and providers of designated health services under Medicare and Medicaid programs Legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse give federal enforcement personnel substantially increased funding powers and remedies to pursue suspected fraud and abuse and these enforcement authorities were further expanded by the ACA While we believe that we are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations many of the regulations applicable to us including those relating to marketing incentives offered in connection with pharmaceutical sales are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts They may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties including the loss of licenses or our ability to participate in Medicare Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs Public concern over the abuse of opioid medications including increased legal and regulatory action could negatively affect our business Certain governmental and regulatory agencies as well as state and local jurisdictions are focused on the abuse of opioid medications in the United States Federal state and local governmental and regulatory agencies are conducting investigations of us and others in the supply chain including pharmaceutical manufacturers and other pharmaceutical wholesale distributors regarding the distribution of opioid medications In addition a significant number of lawsuits have been filed against us other pharmaceutical wholesale distributors and others in the supply chain The lawsuits against us and other pharmaceutical wholesale distributors allege among other claims that we failed to provide effective controls and procedures to guard against the diversion of controlled substances acted negligently by distributing controlled substances to pharmacies that serve individuals who abuse controlled substances and failed to report suspicious orders of controlled substances in accordance with regulations Additional governmental and regulatory entities have indicated an intent to sue and may conduct investigations of us in the future We are deeply committed to diversion control efforts have sophisticated systems in place to identify orders placed warranting further review to determine if they are suspicious including through the use of data analytics and engage in significant due diligence 10 Table of Contents and ongoing monitoring of customers While we are vigorously defending ourselves in these lawsuits the allegations may negatively affect our business in various ways including through increased costs and harm to our reputation We are currently engaged in discussions with the objective of reaching potential terms for a global resolution of the multidistrict opioid litigation and other related state court litigation described in Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Given the large number of parties involved the complexity and difficulty of the underlying issues and the resulting uncertainty of achieving a potential global resolution we continue to litigate and prepare for trial in the cases pending in the multidistrict opioid litigation as well as in state courts where lawsuits have been filed and intend to continue to vigorously defend ourselves in all such cases Since these matters are still developing we are unable to predict the outcome but the result of these lawsuits could include excessive monetary verdicts andor injunctive relief that may affect how we operate our business or we may enter into settlements of claims that may also include monetary payments andor injunctive relief The adverse resolution of any of these lawsuits or investigations could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and cash flows and could result in a lower than historical level of capital available for deployment including a lower level of capital returned to stockholders Legislative regulatory or industry measures to address the misuse of prescription opioid medications may also affect our business in ways that we are not be able to predict For example New York has instituted an opioid excise tax which went into effect on July 1 2019 and taxes entities that make the initial sale or distribution of opioid medications into the state In addition Rhode Island and Delaware have enacted opioid taxes Minnesota has enacted increased licensure fees and other states are considering legislation that could require entities to pay an assessment or tax on the sale or distribution of opioid medications in those states If additional state or local jurisdictions enact legislation that taxes or assesses the sale or distribution of opioid medications and we are not able to mitigate the impact on our business through operational changes or commercial arrangements where permitted such legislation in the aggregate may have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations cash flows or financial condition Our business results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by legal proceedings We conduct our operations through a variety of businesses including the distribution of pharmaceuticals the dispensing of healthcare products and the provision of services to the pharmaceutical industry Each of our businesses may cause us to become involved in legal disputes or proceedings involving healthcare fraud and abuse the False Claims Act antitrust class action commercial employment environmental intellectual property licensing and various other claims including claims related to opioid medications as discussed in the above risk factor Litigation is costly timeconsuming and disruptive to ordinary business operations The defense and resolution of these current and future proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition Violations of various federal and state laws including with respect to the marketing sale purchase and dispensing of pharmaceutical products and the provision of services to the pharmaceutical industry can result in criminal civil and administrative liability for which there can be significant financial damages criminal and civil penalties and possible exclusion from participation in federal and state health programs Any settlement judgment or fine could materially adversely affect our results of operations Statutory andor regulatory violations could also form the basis for qui tam complaints The qui tam provisions of the federal and various state civil False Claims Acts authorize a private person known as a relator to file civil actions under these statutes on behalf of the federal and state governments Under False Claims Acts the filing of a qui tam complaint by a relator imposes obligations on government authorities to investigate the allegations and determine whether or not to intervene in the action Such cases may involve allegations around the marketing sale purchase andor dispensing of brand andor generic pharmaceutical products or the provision of services to the pharmaceutical industry Such complaints are filed under seal and remain sealed until the applicable court orders otherwise Our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if qui tam complaints are filed against us for alleged violations of any health laws and regulations and damages arising from resultant false claims if the litigation proceeds whether or not government authorities decide to intervene in any such matters andor if we are found liable for all or any portion of violations alleged in any such matters In fiscal 2018 we resolved potential civil claims and administrative action by entering into among other things a Corporate Integrity Agreement see Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements The Corporate Integrity Agreement has a fiveyear term Failure to comply with obligations under the Corporate Integrity Agreement could lead to monetary or other penalties 11 Table of Contents Our revenue results of operations and cash flows may suffer upon the loss or renewal at less favorable terms of a significant customer or group purchasing organization WBA accounted for approximately 34 of our revenue in the fiscal year ended September 30 2019  Express Scripts accounted for approximately 13 of our revenue in the fiscal year ended September 30 2019  Our top ten customers including governmental agencies and GPOs represented approximately 64 of revenue in the fiscal year ended September 30 2019  We may lose a significant customer or GPO relationship if any existing contract with such customer or GPO expires without being extended renewed renegotiated or replaced or is terminated by the customer or GPO prior to expiration to the extent such early termination is permitted by the contract A number of our contracts with significant customers or GPOs are typically subject to expiration each year and we may lose any of these customers or GPO relationships if we are unable to extend renew renegotiate or replace the contracts The loss of any significant customer or GPO relationship could adversely affect our revenue results of operations and cash flows Additionally from time to time significant contracts may be renewed prior to their expiration date If those contracts are renewed at less favorable terms they may also negatively impact our revenue results of operations and cash flows The anticipated ongoing strategic and financial benefits of our relationship with WBA may not be realized In May 2016 we extended to 2026 our strategic arrangement with WBA  specifically our distribution agreement under which we distribute drugs to Walgreens pharmacies and our generics purchasing services arrangement under which Walgreens Boots Alliance Development GmbH WBAD provides a variety of services including negotiating acquisition pricing with generic manufacturers on our behalf This reflected our expectation that partnering strategically with WBA would result in various benefits including among other things continued cost savings as a result of our generics purchasing services arrangement with WBAD as well as the potential for exploring innovation together and sharing best practices The processes and initiatives needed to achieve and maintain these benefits are complex costly and timeconsuming Achieving the anticipated benefits from the arrangement on an ongoing basis is subject to a number of significant challenges and uncertainties including the potential inability to realize andor delays in realizing potential benefits resulting from participation in our generics purchasing services arrangement with WBAD including improved generic drug pricing and terms improved service fees from generic manufacturers cost savings innovations or other benefits due to its inability to negotiate successfully with generic manufacturers or otherwise to perform as expected the potential disruption of our plans and operations as a result of the terms under which we extended the duration of the distribution agreement and generics purchasing services agreement including any disruption of our cash flow and ability to return value to our stockholders in accordance with our past practices and any reduction in our operational strategic or financial flexibility potential changes in supplier relationships and terms unexpected or unforeseen costs fees expenses and charges incurred by us related to the transaction or the overall strategic relationship unforeseen changes in the economic terms under which we distribute pharmaceuticals to WBA and any potential issues that could impede our ability to continue to work collaboratively with WBA in an efficient and effective manner in furtherance of the anticipated strategic and financial benefits of the relationship In addition WBA has the right but not the obligation under the transactions contemplated by the Framework and Shareholder Agreements dated March 18 2013 to make certain additional investments in our common stock WBA also has the right to sell any of the shares of our common stock that it has acquired so long as WBA has held the shares beyond the requisite dates specified in the Shareholder Agreement Any sales in the public market of common stock currently held by WBA or acquired by WBA pursuant to open market purchases could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock We could also encounter unforeseen costs circumstances or issues with respect to the transactions and collaboration we anticipate pursuing with WBA Many of these potential circumstances are outside of our control and any of them could result in increased costs decreased revenue decreased benefits and the diversion of management time and attention If we are unable to achieve our objectives within the anticipated time frame or at all the expected future benefits may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations A disruption in our distribution or generic purchasing services arrangements with WBA could adversely affect our business and financial results We are the primary distributor of pharmaceutical products for WBA Our generic pharmaceutical program has also benefited from the generics purchasing services arrangement with WBA If the operations of WBA are seriously disrupted for any reason whether by natural disaster labor disruption regulatory or governmental action or otherwise it could adversely affect our business and our sales and profitability If the generics purchasing services arrangement does not continue to be successful our margins and results of operations could also be adversely affected If our operations are seriously disrupted for any reason we may have an obligation to pay or credit WBA for failure to supply products In addition upon the expiration or termination of the distribution agreement or generics purchasing services arrangement there can be no assurance that we or WBA will be willing to renew on terms favorable to us or at all 12 Table of Contents In addition our business may be adversely affected by any operational financial or regulatory difficulties that WBA experiences including any disruptions of certain of its existing distribution facilities or retail pharmacies resulting from ongoing inspections by the DEA andor state regulatory agencies and possible revocation of the controlled substance registrations for those facilities and pharmacies Tax legislation or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition We are a large corporation with operations in the United States and select global markets As such we are subject to tax laws and regulations of the US federal state and local governments and of various foreign jurisdictions From time to time various legislative initiatives such as the repeal of lastin firstout LIFO treatment or the promulgation of state opioid taxes and fees may be proposed that could adversely affect our tax positions andor our tax liabilities There can be no assurance that our effective tax rate or tax payments will not be adversely affected by legislation resulting from these initiatives We believe that our historical tax positions are consistent with applicable laws regulations and existing precedent In addition US federal state and local as well as foreign tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations There can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge On December 22 2017 the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 the 2017 Tax Act was enacted and contains significant changes to US income tax law Due to the potential for changes to tax laws and regulations or changes to the interpretation thereof including regulations and interpretations pertaining to the 2017 Tax Act the ambiguity of tax laws and regulations the subjectivity of factual interpretations the complexity of our business and intercompany arrangements uncertainties regarding the geographic mix of earnings in any particular period and other factors material adjustments to our tax estimates may impact our provision for income taxes and our earnings per share as well as our cash flows in the period in which any such adjustments would be made The suspension or revocation by federal or state authorities of any of the registrations that must be in effect for our distribution and 503B outsourcing facilities to purchase compound store andor distribute pharmaceuticals and controlled substances the refusal by such authorities to issue a registration to any such facility or any enforcement action or other litigation that arises out of our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations governing distribution and 503B outsourcing facilities may adversely affect our reputation our business and our results of operations The DEA FDA DOJ and various other federal and state authorities regulate the distribution of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances and the compounding of pharmaceuticals that contain controlled substances We are required to hold valid DEA and statelevel licenses meet various security and operating standards and comply with the Controlled Substances Act and its implementing regulations governing the sale marketing packaging compounding holding and distribution of controlled substances Government authorities may from time to time investigate whether we are in compliance with various security and operating standards applicable to the distribution of controlled substances including whether we are adequately detecting and preventing the illegal diversion of controlled substances Although we have procedures in place that are intended to ensure compliance with such laws and regulations there can be no assurance that a regulatory agency or tribunal would conclude that our operations are compliant with applicable laws and regulations If we were found to be noncompliant with such laws and regulations federal and state authorities have broad enforcement powers including i the ability to suspend our distribution centers and 503B outsourcing facilities licenses to distribute and compound pharmaceutical products including controlled substances ii seize or recall products and iii impose significant criminal civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations each of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business and results of operations We have received and may in the future receive requests for information letters and subpoenas from the DEA FDA various US Attorneys Offices of the DOJ andor state attorneys general and state regulatory authorities and agencies related to our distribution of controlled substances and our order monitoring program which is designed to prevent and detect the illegal diversion of controlled substances or other matters We generally respond to subpoenas requests letters and other authority andor agency correspondence in a thorough and timely manner These responses require time and effort and can result in considerable costs being incurred by us such as costs related to addressing the observations listed on FDA Form 483 reports Such subpoenas requests and letters can also lead to the assertion of claims or the commencement of civil criminal or regulatory legal proceedings against us as well as to settlements and the suspension or revocation of registrations required by our distribution and 503B outsourcing facilities each of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business and results of operations In December 2017 following FDA inspections of our 503B outsourcing facilities we voluntarily suspended production activities at our largest 503B outsourcing facility located in Memphis Tennessee In May 2019 PharMEDium reached an agreement on the terms of a consent decree the Consent Decree with the FDA and the Consumer Protection Branch of the Civil Division of the DOJ The Consent Decree permits commercial operations to continue at PharMEDiums Dayton New Jersey and Sugar Land Texas compounding facilities and administrative operations to continue at its Lake Forest Illinois headquarters subject to 13 Table of Contents compliance with the requirements set forth therein As required by the Consent Decree we have completed audit inspections by an independent cGMP expert at the Dayton and Sugar Land facilities to determine that the facilities are being operated in conformity with cGMP Additional audit inspections by the independent cGMP expert of the Sugar Land and Dayton facilities are also required at least annually for a period of four years The Consent Decree also establishes requirements that must be satisfied prior to the resumption of commercial operations at the Memphis Tennessee facility Through fiscal 2019 our results of operations were adversely impacted by the Memphis suspension Our results of operations will continue to be adversely impacted until the Memphis facility resumes commercial distribution and we cannot predict if or when the FDA will permit PharMEDium to resume commercial distribution at the Memphis facility Separately we have agreed in several state regulatory matters to consent orders or temporary licensing suspensions regarding certain of our 503B outsourcing facilities Certain other states have requested information concerning the status of operations at some or all of our 503B outsourcing facilities These state regulatory matters preclude us from commercially distributing into certain states which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations Additionally the FDA may from time to time issue Form 483 reports and warning letters in connection with their oversight of 503B outsourcing facilities Prior to our acquisition of the business PharMEDium received a warning letter from the FDA in 2014 and a series of Form 483 reports were issued in 2015 and 2016 following up on the 2014 letter We cannot be assured that the FDA and DOJ will be satisfied with the sufficiency or timing of PharMEDiums corrective actions in response to this warning letter or the Form 483 reports A failure to comply with the Consent Decree or to address observations identified by the FDA in Form 483 reports or any warning letters issued by the FDA or observations identified by any other federal and state regulatory authority including a failure to resolve the observations identified by the 2014 warning letter and subsequent Form 483 reports could lead to the suspension of facilities currently in operation an enforcement action monetary penalties andor license revocation each of which could have an adverse effect on our reputation business and results of operations The products compounded by our CSP business are administered by our customers to patients intravenously and failures or errors in production labeling or packaging could contribute to patient harm or death which may subject us to significant liabilities and reputational harm The production labeling and packaging of CSPs is inherently risky Our CSP business sells CSPs to acute care hospitals freestanding hospital outpatient departments and ambulatory surgery centers who then administer the CSPs to patients intravenously or through other injectable routes of administration There are a number of factors that could result in the injury or death of a patient who receives one of our CSPs including quality issues manufacturing or labeling flaws improper packaging or unanticipated or improper uses of the products any of which could result from human or other error Any of these situations could lead to a recall of or safety alert relating to one or more of our products In addition in the ordinary course of business we may voluntarily recall or retrieve products Any recall or retrieval whether voluntary or requested by the FDA or state regulatory authorities could result in significant costs and negative publicity Negative publicity including regarding a quality or safety issue whether accurate or inaccurate could reduce market acceptance of our products harm our reputation decrease demand for our products result in the loss of customers lead to product withdrawals and harm our ability to successfully launch new products and services These problems could also result in enforcement actions by state and federal authorities or other healthcare selfregulatory bodies or product liability claims or lawsuits including those brought by individuals or groups seeking to represent a class or establish multidistrict litigation proceedings Any such action litigation recall or reputational harm resulting from patient harm or death caused by CSPs prepared by a competitor or a hospital pharmacy could result in a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity Our current or future insurance coverage may prove insufficient to cover any liability claims brought against us Changes in the commercial insurance market may impair or prohibit our ability to obtain insurance coverage that will be adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise Our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected if we undertake acquisitions of or investments in businesses that do not perform as we expect or that are difficult for us to integrate As part of our strategy we seek to pursue acquisitions of and investments in other companies At any particular time we may be in various stages of assessment discussion and negotiation with regard to one or more potential acquisitions or investments not all of which will be consummated We make public disclosure of pending and completed acquisitions when appropriate and required by applicable securities laws and regulations Acquisitions involve numerous risks and uncertainties and may be of businesses in which we lack operational or market experience If we complete one or more acquisitions our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by a number of factors including regulatory or compliance issues that could arise changes in regulations and laws the failure 14 Table of Contents of the acquired businesses to achieve the results we have projected in either the near or long term the assumption of unknown liabilities including litigation risks the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed not being properly estimated the difficulties of imposing adequate financial and operating controls on the acquired companies and their management and the potential liabilities that might arise pending the imposition of adequate controls the difficulties in the integration of the operations technologies services and products of the acquired companies and the failure to achieve the strategic objectives of these acquisitions As previously disclosed we have commenced a comprehensive strategic and financial review of PharMEDium which remains ongoing The review includes consideration of the ongoing regulatory operational and financial challenges that face PharMEDium as a result of the Consent Decree state regulatory actions and related matters While we are unable to predict the outcome of the review if we are unable to achieve our objectives within the anticipated time frame or at all it could have a material adverse effect on our reputation results of operations or financial condition Our business and results of operations may be adversely affected if we fail to manage and complete divestitures We regularly evaluate our portfolio in order to determine whether an asset or business may no longer help us meet our objectives When we decide to sell assets or a business we may encounter difficulty finding buyers or alternative exit strategies which could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives The impact of a divestiture on our results of operations could also be greater than anticipated Violations of antibribery anticorruption andor international trade laws to which we are subject could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations We are subject to laws concerning our business operations and marketing activities in foreign countries where we conduct business For example we are subject to the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act the FCPA US export control and trade sanction laws and similar anticorruption and international trade laws in certain foreign countries such as the UK Bribery Act any violation of which could create substantial liability for us and also cause a loss of reputation in the market The FCPA generally prohibits US companies and their officers directors employees and intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment The FCPA also requires that US public companies maintain books and records that fairly and accurately reflect transactions and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls If we are found to have violated the FCPA we may face sanctions including civil and criminal fines disgorgement of profits and suspension or debarment of our ability to contract with government agencies or receive export licenses From time to time we may face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign government agencies relating to our international business activities compliance with which could be costly and timeconsuming and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations An adverse outcome under any such investigation or audit could subject us to fines or other penalties which could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations Our results of operations and our financial condition may be adversely affected by our global operations Our operations in jurisdictions outside of the United States are subject to various risks inherent in global operations We currently have operations in over 50 countries We may conduct business in additional foreign jurisdictions in the future which may carry operational risks in addition to the risks of acquisition described above At any particular time our global operations may be affected by local changes in laws regulations and the political and economic environments including inflation recession currency volatility and competition Changes or uncertainty in US or foreign policy including any changes or uncertainty with respect to US or international trade policies or tariffs also can disrupt our global operations as well as our customers and suppliers in a particular location and may require us to spend more money to source certain products or materials that we purchase Any of these factors could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations Our stock price and our ability to access credit markets may be adversely affected by financial market volatility and disruption or a downgrade in our credit ratings If the capital and credit markets experience significant disruption and volatility in the future there can be no assurance that we will not experience downward movement in our stock price without regard to our financial condition or results of operations or an adverse effect which may be material on our ability to access credit Although we believe that our operating cash flow and existing credit arrangements give us the ability to meet our financing needs there can be no assurance that disruption and volatility will not increase our costs of borrowing impair our liquidity or adversely impact our business Additionally rating agencies continually review the ratings they have assigned to us and our outstanding debt securities To maintain our ratings we are required to meet certain financial performance ratios Liabilities related to litigation or any significant related settlements an increase in our debt or a decline in our earnings could result in downgrades in our credit ratings Actual or 15 Table of Contents anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade or have been assigned a negative outlook could limit our access to public debt markets limit the institutions willing to provide credit to us result in more restrictive financial and other covenants in our public and private debt and would likely increase our overall borrowing costs and adversely affect our earnings Our results of operations may suffer upon the bankruptcy insolvency or other credit failure of a significant supplier Our relationships with pharmaceutical suppliers give rise to substantial amounts that are due to us from the suppliers including amounts owed to us for returned goods or defective goods chargebacks and amounts due to us for services provided to the suppliers Volatility of the capital and credit markets general economic conditions pending litigation and regulatory changes may adversely affect the solvency or creditworthiness of our suppliers The bankruptcy insolvency or other credit failure of any supplier at a time when the supplier has a substantial account payable balance due to us could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations Our revenue and results of operations may suffer upon the bankruptcy insolvency or other credit failure of a significant customer Most of our customers buy pharmaceuticals and other products and services from us on credit Credit is made available to customers based upon our assessment and analysis of creditworthiness Although we often try to obtain a security interest in assets and other arrangements intended to protect our credit exposure we generally are either subordinated to the position of the primary lenders to our customers or substantially unsecured Volatility of the capital and credit markets general economic conditions and regulatory changes including changes in reimbursement may adversely affect the solvency or creditworthiness of our customers The bankruptcy insolvency or other credit failure of any customer that has a substantial amount owed to us could have a material adverse effect on our operating revenue and results of operations As of September 30 2019  our two largest trade receivable balances due from customers represented approximately 49 and 8 of accounts receivable net Recently one of our customers Diplomat Pharmacy Inc Diplomat indicated in a public filing that it believes it is probable it will need to obtain waivers as of December 31 2019 for breach of certain financial debt covenants in its credit agreement Diplomats Quarterly Report on Form 10Q for the quarter ended September 30 2019 the Diplomat 10Q also reflected managements assessment that there is uncertainty regarding its ability to maintain liquidity sufficient to operate its business effectively which raises substantial doubt as to Diplomats ability to continue as a going concern The Diplomat 10Q stated that if Diplomat violates its covenants and access to its credit facility is terminated or its indebtedness thereunder is accelerated it may be unable to repay its obligations due under the credit agreement which would have a material adverse impact on its liquidity and business As a result of the foregoing including the consequences of the going concern assessment of Diplomats management we may be unable to recover amounts owed to us and to continue the relationship on our current terms As of November 15 2019 our trade receivable balance due from this customer was approximately 1096 million none of which was past due as of such date Risks generally associated with our sophisticated information systems may adversely affect our business and results of operations Our businesses rely on sophisticated information systems to obtain rapidly process analyze and manage data to facilitate the purchase and distribution of thousands of inventory items from numerous distribution centers to receive process and ship orders on a timely basis to account for other product and service transactions with customers to manage the accurate billing and collections for thousands of customers and to process payments to suppliers We continue to make substantial investments in data centers and information systems including but not limited to a program to enhance and upgrade our information technology systems Thirdparty service providers are also responsible for managing a portion of our information systems To the extent our information systems are not successfully implemented or fail or to the extent there are data center interruptions our business and results of operations may be adversely affected Our business and results of operations may also be adversely affected if a thirdparty service provider does not perform satisfactorily or if the information systems are interrupted or damaged by unforeseen events including due to the actions of third parties Information security risks have generally increased in recent years because of the proliferation of cloudbased infrastructure and other services new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyber attacks A failure interruption or breach of our operational or information security systems or those of our thirdparty service providers as a result of cyber attacks or information security breaches could disrupt our business result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information or personal data damage our reputation increase our costs andor cause losses As a result cyber security and the continued development and enhancement of the controls and processes designed to protect our systems computers software data and networks from attack damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for us Although we believe 16 Table of Contents that we have robust information security procedures and other safeguards in place as cyber threats continue to evolve we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance our information security measures andor to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities Risks generally associated with data privacy regulation and the international transfer of personal data We are required to comply with increasingly complex and changing data privacy regulations both in the United States and beyond that regulate the collection use security processing and transfer of personal data including particularly the transfer of personal data between or among countries Many of these regulations also grant rights to individuals Many foreign data privacy regulations including GDPR in the European Union and the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act in Canada and certain state regulations including Californias CCPA are more stringent than those enacted under United States federal law We may also face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign government agencies relating to our compliance with these regulations An adverse outcome under any such investigation or audit could subject us to fines or other penalties That or other circumstances related to our collection use and transfer of personal data could cause a loss of reputation in the market andor adversely affect our business and financial position Our goodwill indefinitelived intangible assets or longlived assets may become impaired which may require us to record a further significant charge to earnings in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles US generally accepted accounting principles GAAP require us to test our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist Indicators that are considered include significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results significant negative industry or economic trends or a significant decline in our stock price andor market capitalization for a sustained period of time In addition we periodically review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our longlived assets may not be recoverable include slower growth rates the loss of a significant customer or divestiture of a business or asset for below its carrying value The testing required by GAAP involves estimates and judgments by management As a result of the suspension of production activities at PharMEDiums compounding facility located in Memphis Tennessee and the entry into the Consent Decree the Company performed a recoverability assessment of PharMEDiums longlived assets and recorded an impairment loss in fiscal year 2019 for the amount that the carrying value of the PharMEDium asset group exceeded its fair value Although we believe our assumptions and estimates are reasonable and appropriate any changes in key assumptions including a failure to meet business plans or other unanticipated events and circumstances such as a rise in interest rates may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates We may be required to record a further significant charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill indefinitelived intangible assets or longlived assets is determined Any such charge could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations Natural disasters or other unexpected events may disrupt our operations adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and may not be covered by insurance The occurrence of one or more unexpected events including fires tornadoes tsunamis hurricanes earthquakes floods and other severe hazards or accidents in the United States or in other countries in which we operate or are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance Extreme weather natural disasters power outages or other unexpected events could result in physical damage to and complete or partial closure of one or more of distribution centers or outsourcing facilities temporary or longterm disruption in the supply of products delay in the delivery of products to our distribution centers andor disruption of our ability to deliver products to customers Current or future insurance arrangements may not provide protection for costs that may arise from such events particularly if such events are catastrophic in nature or occur in combination Further the longterm effects of climate change on general economic conditions and the pharmaceutical distribution industry in particular are unclear and changes in the supply demand or available sources of energy and the regulatory and other costs associated with energy production and delivery may affect the availability or cost of goods and services including natural resources necessary to run our businesses Any longterm disruption in our ability to service our customers from one or more distribution centers or outsourcing facilities could have a material adverse effect on our operations Declining economic conditions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition Our operations and performance depend on economic conditions in the United States and other countries where we do business Deterioration in general economic conditions could adversely affect the amount of prescriptions that are filled and the amount of pharmaceutical products purchased by consumers and therefore could reduce purchases by our customers which would negatively affect our revenue growth and cause a decrease in our profitability Negative trends in the general economy 17 Table of Contents including interest rate fluctuations financial market volatility or credit market disruptions may also affect our customers ability to obtain credit to finance their businesses on acceptable terms and reduce discretionary spending on health products Reduced purchases by our customers or changes in payment terms could adversely affect our revenue growth and cause a decrease in our cash flow from operations Bankruptcies or similar events affecting our customers may cause us to incur bad debt expense at levels higher than historically experienced Declining economic conditions may also increase our costs If the economic conditions in the United States or in the countries where we do business do not improve or deteriorate our results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected ITEM 1B UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None ITEM 2 PROPERTIES As of September 30 2019  we conducted our business from office and operating facilities at owned and leased
