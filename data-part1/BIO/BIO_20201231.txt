above tenets provides us with product candidates that have an improved profile for clinical development and an enhanced probability of success We are focused on developing and commercializing diseasemodifying therapies that can have a transformative impact on patients lives Utilizing our rigorous selection process we have assembled a deep portfolio of product 5 Table of Contents candidates for rare monogenic CNS disorders Our first product candidate PBGM01 utilizes a nextgeneration AAVhu68 capsid to deliver to the brain and peripheral tissues a functional GLB1 gene encoding lysosomal betagalactosidase or gal for GM1 Our second product candidate PBFT02 utilizes an AAV1 capsid to deliver to the brain a functional GRN gene encoding progranulin or PGRN for FTD caused by progranulin deficiency or FTDGRN Our third product candidate PBKR03 utilizes a nextgeneration AAVhu68 capsid to deliver to the brain and peripheral tissues a functional gene encoding the hydrolytic enzyme galactosylceramidase or GALC  for Krabbe disease There are currently no approved diseasemodifying therapies for these diseases We believe our lead product candidates have the potential to provide patients with significantly improved outcomes given our chosen route of intra cisterna magna or ICM administration which is an injection at the craniocervical junction our target choice of secreted proteins that leverage the crosscorrection mechanism thereby reducing transduction requirements and our capsid and transgene selection process which allows us to choose vectors that are fitforpurpose for specific indications We also have four programs in the research stage PBML04 for metachromatic leukodystrophy or MLD PBAL05 for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or ALS PBCM06 for CharcotMarieTooth Type 2A or CMT2A and one program for an undisclosed target  PBML04 is targeting MLD patients who have mutations in the ARSA gene PBAL05 is targeting ALS patients who have a gainoffunction mutation in the C9orf72 gene PBCM06 is targeting CMT2A patients who have a mutation in the MFN2 gene and our undisclosed program is targeting an adult CNS indication We also have an option to license ten additional programs from Penn in rare monogenic CNS indications through 2025 We are led by pioneers and experts with decades of collective experience in genetic medicines rare disease drug development manufacturing and commercialization Our scientific founders Dr Stephen Squinto Dr James Wilson and Dr Tadataka Yamada are world leaders in research and development in the fields of rare disease and genetic medicine Dr Wilsons and Dr Yamadas continuing relationship with our company and involvement in both academic research and clinical drug development allows us to gain early insight into

genetic medicine products at companies such as Allos Therapeutics Biogen GlaxoSmithKline Janssen Pharmaceuticals Lycera Merck  Co Momenta Pharmaceuticals NPS Pharmaceuticals Pharmasset Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical and ViroPharma Our pipeline We have assembled a deep portfolio of genetic medicine product candidates for rare monogenic CNS disorders characterized by high unmet medical needs We intend to further expand our portfolio with genetic medicine product candidates for other rare monogenic CNS disorders as well as other treatment approaches as technology advances in the field Our development programs consist of 1 10 additional new pipeline license options 2 Program includes ongoing natural history study of infantile and juvenile GM1 gangliosidosis patients 6 Table of Contents  PBGM01 for the treatment of GM1 We are currently developing PBGM01 which utilizes a proprietary nextgeneration AAVhu68 capsid to deliver to the brain and peripheral tissues a functional GLB1 gene encoding gal for infantile GM1 Infantile GM1 is the most common and severe form of GM1 in which patients have mutations in the GLB1 gene that produce little or no residual gal enzyme activity gal is an enzyme that catalyzes the first step in the natural degradation of GM1 ganglioside Reduced gal activity results in the accumulation of toxic levels of GM1 ganglioside in neurons throughout the brain causing rapidly progressive neurodegeneration with a life expectancy of two to four years Currently there are no diseasemodifying therapies approved for the treatment of GM1 Early onset infantile GM1 is characterized by onset in the first 6 months of life while late onset infantile GM1 is characterized by onset between 6 and 24 months We believe PBGM01 could provide patients with significantly improved outcomes In preclinical models we have observed meaningful transduction of both the CNS and critical peripheral organs for GM1 patients using our ICM method of administration in combination with our nextgeneration AAVhu68 capsid which involves an injection at the craniocervical junction In December 2020 the US Food and Drug Administration or FDA cleared our IND for PBGM01 which allows us to proceed with our clinical trial We expect to initiate patient enrollment in our Imagine1 Trial an international multicenter openlabel singlearm Phase 12 clinical trial of PBGM01 in patients with a diagnosis of early and late infantile GM1 in the first quarter of 2021 In December 2020 we received a CTA for our Imagine1 Trial for PBGM01 from UK MHRA In January 2021 we received a CTA for our Imagine1 Trial for PCGM01 from Health Canada We expect to report initial 30day safety and biomarker data from the initial cohort midyear 2021 PBFT02 for the treatment of FTDGRN We are currently developing PBFT02 which utilizes an AAV1 capsid to deliver to the brain a functional granulin or GRN gene encoding progranulin or PGRN for the treatment of FTDGRN FTDGRN is an inheritable form of FTD in which patients have mutations in the GRN gene causing a deficiency in PGRN PGRN is a complex and highly conserved protein thought to have multiple roles in cell biology development and inflammation Emerging evidence suggests that PGRNs pathogenic contribution to FTD and other neurodegenerative disorders relates to a critical role in lysosomal function Currently there are no diseasemodifying therapies approved for the treatment of FTDGRN We believe PBFT02 may provide patients with significantly improved outcomes In a nonhuman primate or NHP model we observed superior transduction results of the CNS using our ICM method of administration and an AAV1 capsid compared to other AAV capsids In January 2021 we received FDA clearance of our IND for PBFT02 We plan to submit CTAs to the United Kingdom Italy Brazil and Canada We expect to initiate patient enrollment for a Phase 12 trial in the first half of 2021 and anticipate clinical data to be available in late 2021 or early 2022  PBKR03 for the treatment of Krabbe disease We are currently developing PBKR03 which utilizes a proprietary nextgeneration AAVhu68 capsid to deliver to the brain and peripheral tissues a functional GALC gene encoding the hydrolytic enzyme galactosylceramidase for Krabbe disease Krabbe disease is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease caused by mutations in the GALC gene which provides instructions for making an enzyme called galactosylceramidase which breaks down certain fats including galactosylceramide and psychosine This results in the accumulation of psychosine resulting in widespread death of myelinproducing cells in the CNS and in the peripheral nervous system or PNS Without myelin nerves in the brain and other parts of the body cannot transmit signals properly leading to the signs and symptoms of Krabbe disease We believe PBKR03 may provide patients with significantly improved outcomes In preclinical models we have observed meaningful transduction of both the CNS and other critical peripheral organs for Krabbe disease patients using our ICM method of administration in combination with our nextgeneration AAVhu68 capsid In February 2021 we received clearance from the FDA on our IND for PBKR03 We plan to submit CTAs for PBKR03 in Canada UK Brazil Netherlands and Israel We expect to initiate patient enrollment for a Phase 12 trial in the first half of 2021 and anticipate clinical data to be available in late 2021 or early 2022  7 Table of Contents Research Programs We also have four programs in the research stage under our license agreement with Penn PBML04 for MLD PBAL05 for ALS PBCM06 for CMT2A and an undisclosed program to treat an adult CNS indication PBML04 is targeting patients with MLD who have mutations in the ARSA gene PBAL05 is targeting patients with ALS who have a gainoffunction mutation in the C9orf72 gene and PBCM06 is targeting patients with CMT2A who have a mutation in the MFN2 gene Beyond this portfolio through our research collaboration with GTP we also have the option to license programs for ten additional new indications in rare monogenic CNS along with rights and licenses to new gene therapy technologies developed by Penn such as novel capsids toxicity reduction technologies and delivery and formulation Our Strategy We are a genetic medicines company focused on developing transformative therapies for rare monogenic CNS disorders with limited or no approved treatment options Our vision is to finally fulfill the promise of gene therapy by developing groundbreaking therapies that transform the lives of patients with rare monogenic CNS diseases To achieve our vision we have assembled a worldclass team whose members have decades of collective experience in genetic medicines and rare disease drug development and commercialization We leverage this experience along with the decades of experience of our scientific founders Dr Wilson and Dr Yamada as well as the transformative potential of genetic medicine technology to develop treatments that improve outcomes for patients with serious lifethreatening rare diseases Patients are considered every step of the way in every decision we make Key elements of our strategy include  Focus on rare underserved indications for which we can have a transformative impact on patients lives We believe that genetic medicine has the potential to have a transformative impact on rare monogenic CNS disorders and on patients lives by providing them with a treatment for lifethreatening diseases with no approved diseasemodifying treatments   Rapidly advance our lead product candidates through clinical development through commercialization We leverage our collaboration with GTP as well as our internal capabilities to select optimal product candidates for each indication based on extensive preclinical data including animal data and diseasespecific animal models and biomarkers thus enhancing the probability of clinical success of our product candidates Our goal is to select candidates that have the potential to address high unmet clinical needs and have transformative therapeutic effects for our patients If our clinical trials are successful we plan to meet with regulatory authorities to discuss expedited regulatory approval strategies   Advance and expand our pipeline by identifying and developing additional product candidates into the clinic We believe our differentiated drug development approach as well as our internal and partnered research capabilities may allow us to address a broad range of rare monogenic CNS disorders thus expanding our pipeline Through our collaboration with GTP we are continuing to develop additional genetic medicine product candidates targeting lifethreatening rare CNS monogenic disorders Beyond our three initial lead product candidates we have four additional products advancing through the research stage We also have the option to license ten additional rare monogenic CNS indications from GTP through 2025  Extend existing and establish new relationships with patients and patient advocacy groups Patients are at the core of what we do We have been engaging with them and with their advocacy groups since our inception and have acquired an intimate understanding of how we can positively impact their lives These relationships deeply inform us as we develop and ultimately seek to commercialize our product candidates Our relationship with Penns ODC which is currently performing a natural history study for GM1 we are funding represents an example of our strategy and has been helping us to engage effectively with patients We have also established a collaboration with Invitae to facilitate genetic 8 Table of Contents testing and support early identification of GM1 through Invitaes Detect Lysosomal Storage Disorders as well as provide clinical trial information to physicians and patients  Continue to develop proprietary manufacturing capabilities We believe the quality reliability and scalability of our genetic medicine manufacturing techniques and knowhow will be a critical advantage to our longterm success We currently have access to a stateoftheart purposefit manufacturing suite through Catalent Maryland formerly Paragon Gene Therapy a unit of Catalent Biologics Inc or Catalent We expect this facility will be capable of producing supplies of our product candidates sufficient to conduct our clinical trials and potentially for initial commercial launch of our lead product candidates if approved Catalent will also provide packaging labeling and distribution services including its FastChain demand led supply offering which we believe is well suited to studies of advanced therapy medicinal products We expect to open our own laboratory in the second quarter of 2021 which will initially focus on stateoftheart analytical capabilities clinical assay development and validation biomarker assay validation and clinical product testing to support both viral vector manufacturing and clinical development We will continue to invest in developing our manufacturing capabilities and plan to establish our own manufacturing facility for longterm commercial supplies   Selectively enter into new discovery relationships with premier research institutions and expand our existing collaboration We will continue to foster our wellestablished relationship with Penn and potentially enter into new collaborations to build our pipeline We will look to nurture our genetic medicine technology capabilities by keeping abreast of advances in nextgeneration capsid development promoter selection transgene design gene silencing and gene editing which will help us to engineer optimal product profiles to address lifethreating rare monogenic CNS disorders characterized by high unmet medical needs Genetic Medicine Background Each persons genetic material or genome consists of deoxyribonucleic acid or DNA in sequences of genetic code called genes The DNA in the human genome contains approximately three billion nucleotide base pairs and small changes or mutations routinely occur in the base pairs A mutation in a single gene can alter the amount or activity of the protein expressed by the gene causing deformities and disease Currently there are estimated to be over 10000 diseases caused by a genetic abnormality in a single gene These are also known as monogenic diseases Based on research commissioned by us we believe there are at least 790 rare monogenic CNS diseases with few currently approved disease modifying treatments for any rare monogenic CNS diseases The development of molecular therapeutics to modulate human gene expression and correct diseasecausing genetic defects had its advent several decades ago and with advances in science and a deeper understanding of human genetics it has expanded to include a broader range of genetic medicines with the potential to modulate gene expression through additional molecular mechanisms These transformative genetic medicines include gene therapy delivery of an external gene to replace a defective gene gene silencing delivery of a DNA or ribonucleic acid or RNA based therapeutic that modulates the transcription or translation of an injurious gene product gene editing delivery of a DNA or RNAbased therapeutic that corrects the expression of targeted genes and combinations of these therapeutic modalities We believe that this expanded molecular biological tool box will provide new therapeutics with the potential to deliver highly potent and safe interventions across a diverse set of genetic diseases offering several advantages including  Potential to treat most diseases of genetic etiology Theoretically it should be possible to design and deliver a genetic medicine to correct the expression of any human protein whose presence absence or activity causes disease   Potential to target mechanisms that have not been effectively or safely modulated by traditional small molecule or proteinbased therapeutics The inherent specificity of genetic medicines for unique nucleic acid sequences can provide a high therapeutic index resulting from high potency and the potential to deliver adequate doses while avoiding offtarget safety liabilities  9 Table of Contents  Efficient delivery of transformative therapeutics Because genetic medicines are designed to deliver a longstanding effect following a single administration a single dose of these therapeutics has the potential to provide clinical benefits for many years  Genetic medicines can be designed to mitigate challenges faced by other approaches in the development of therapeutics for the CNS Rare monogenic CNS disorders are among the most devastating in their impact on patients and their families These disorders are generally lifethreatening to patients There is a significant need for genetic medicines that can target these genes because the brain is susceptible to mutations in single genes Due to a historical preference in the drug industry to develop drugs for broader CNS indications many of these rare CNS disorders currently have no approved therapies We are focused on rare monogenic CNS disorders because they offer a compelling opportunity for the effective application of genetic medicines Our Approach The field of genetic medicine is rapidly expanding and we believe we have developed a differentiated approach to developing treatments for rare monogenic CNS disorders that allows us to select and advance product candidates with a higher probability of technical and regulatory success Our gene therapy product candidates use an AAV a small nonpathogenic virus that is genetically engineered to function as a delivery vehicle or vector The AAV is administered to a patient to introduce a healthy copy of a mutated gene to the cells in a process referred to as transduction The components of an AAV gene therapy vector include the therapeutic gene that makes up the DNA payload or the transgene the outer viral shell that encloses the DNA payload or the capsid and any promotors added to the vector to boost expression of the transgene The AAV is often described by the serotype or strain of the vector The core tenets of our approach include a rigorous process for selecting product candidates mitigation of early development risk through relationships with leading researchers and academic institutions and mitigation of clinical development risk through deep relationships with patient advocacy groups key opinion leaders and practitioners Together these relationships allow us to directly benefit from decades of collective experience the latest technologies and contemporary perspectives from patients and their experiences Rigorous Process for Selecting Product Candidates In selecting our product candidates we focus initially on optimizing transduction and expression of transgenes in the indicationspecific target tissues This involves prioritizing the following principles selection of the route of administration to maximize transgene biodistribution selection of capsid transgene and promoter to optimize efficiency of transduction and expression in the target tissue leveraging biological mechanisms such as crosscorrection to maximize availability of transgene product to target cells and the effective use of biomarkers to assess treatment effects on transduction transgene expression and on disease pathophysiology  Optimal route of administration Identifying the optimal route of administration for AAV gene therapy is critical to achieving safe and effective levels of transgene expression in the targeted location in the CNS The optimal route of administration for CNS treatments should also leverage the immunoprivileged aspects of the CNS to reduce the potential effects of neutralizing antibodies or NAbs on AAV capsids which are often faced by gene therapy product candidates We will evaluate preclinical studies and other data to decide the preferred route of administration on a programbyprogram basis For our three lead product candidates we believe that ICM delivery is the optimal route of administration as compared to other potential delivery mechanisms due to its diffuse delivery distribution potential for improved biodistribution to the brain and spinal cord and transduction and lower expected toxicity Delivery through ICM can also reduce the potential impact of NAbs as compared with intravenous administration We believe that by using ICM we can achieve comparable protein expression at lower dosages than would be required by other delivery routes  Capsid transgene and promoter selection For each of our programs we conduct rigorous studies to select the capsid transgene and promoter to use for our product candidate We identify the optimal AAV gene therapy for each of our indications depending on the target indication our goal of CNS andor PNS transduction and the target brain regions and cell types Typically we compare multiple capsids in NHPs to identify the capsid best suited for each program 10 Table of Contents  Crosscorrection Our three lead product candidates exploit the crosscorrection mechanism by which secreted gene product from transduced cells is taken up by nontransduced neurons We believe this crosscorrection mechanism can help overcome the limits of vector biodistribution and CNS transduction inefficiency that are characteristic of other genetic medicine approaches and ultimately drive clinical benefit   Effective use of biomarkers Our development program targets must have measurable predictive biomarkers to inform early and efficient clinical development decisions These include pharmacodynamic biomarkers to confirm achievement of target levels of transduction and gene expression and disease activity and progression biomarkers to confirm downstream effects on the underlying disease pathophysiology  Mitigation of Early Development Risk of Programs Prior to IND submission We have a strategic research collaboration with GTP which is led by our cofounder and Chief Scientific Advisor Dr Wilson and which we believe positions us at the forefront of gene therapy research This collaboration provides us with access to differentiated discovery technology and expertise that informs the basis of our product candidate selection and subsequent development Our strategic research collaboration with GTP provides us with access through 2025 to one of the premier gene therapy research institutes in the world for the discovery and preclinical development of gene therapy product candidates and exclusive rights to certain rare monogenic CNS disorders including nextgeneration AAV capsid technology and vector engineering and stateofthe art preclinical animal studies including NHP models GTP currently employs approximately 300 staff with cutting edge expertise and capabilities in gene therapy research and preclinical development Our collaboration with GTP allows us to choose programs that have been or will be validated through extensive testing in preclinical disease models and once selected to collaborate with GTP on further preclinical optimization of our product candidate such as vector choice transgene construct and route of administration We believe this collaboration improves our probability of technical and regulatory success in developing product candidates that provide transformative clinical benefits Once we select a particular rare monogenic CNS indication for further development GTP with our close involvement and oversight embarks on a rational discovery and development program to design product candidates that may provide improved clinical benefit We usually evaluate transduction efficiency and biodistribution using multiple different capsids in NHPs to select the capsid best suited for the targeted indication GTP also works to optimize the delivery method used for each product candidate by balancing delivery efficacy safety host immunity and ease of administration We believe the translational preclinical characterization provided by GTP including the use of NHP models for vector screening and toxicology reduces the earlystage development risk of our product candidates Pursuant to our discovery collaboration GTP will also notify us of any new technologies it discovers develops or engineers as part of its discovery program through 2025 We then have the option to acquire the right to use such new technologies for our product candidates for our selected indications Mitigation of Clinical Development Risk through Our Relationship with Penns ODC We also have a strong relationship with Penns ODC As part of our research collaboration with GTP we have access to Penns ODCs insights and capabilities in the study of rare diseases We leverage our close working relationship with Penns ODC to develop historical and prospective external data for each disease for use in building comparable patient profiles of participants in interventional trials In addition we believe Penns ODCs close ties to leading clinical centers for rare monogenic CNS disorders will improve our ability to identify potential patients for trial enrollment and enhance patient retention and data quality Penns ODC is currently performing a natural history study for GM1 funded by us 11 Table of Contents Our Product Candidates GM1PBGM01 Overview of GM1 GM1 is a rare and often lifethreatening monogenic recessive lysosomal storage disease that results in progressive damage to both the CNS and the peripheral tissues The infantile form of the disease is characterized by onset in the first two years of life with symptoms including hypotonia reduced muscle tone progressive CNS dysfunction leading to deafness blindness enlarged liver and spleen rigidity and progressive skeletal dysplasia that leads to restrictive lung disease and aspiration pneumonia Early onset infantile GM1 also referred to as Type I is characterized by onset in the first six months of life while late onset infantile GM1 also referred to as Type IIa is characterized by onset between six and 24 months The disease rapidly progresses with a life expectancy of less than two years for early infantile GM1 and five to ten years for late infantile GM1 GM1 is caused by recessive mutations in the GLB1 gene which encodes lysosomal acid betagalactosidase or gal an enzyme that catalyzes the first step in the natural degradation of GM1 ganglioside Reduced gal activity results in the accumulation of toxic levels of GM1 ganglioside in neurons throughout the brain causing rapidly progressing neurodegeneration GM1 manifests as a continuum of clinical severity ranging from infants with earlier onset and more severe and rapidly progressive disease to those with later juvenile or adult onset slower progression and less severe manifestations The global incidence of GM1 has been estimated to be 05 to 1 in 100000 live births with infantile GM1 representing approximately 625 of such cases No states include GM1 in mandatory infant screening We engaged a thirdparty dataanalytics firm to conduct an analysis of a variety of deidentified electronic medical records Based on this analysis we estimate the incidence of infantile GM1 to be approximately 14 in 100000 live births Currently there are no approved diseasemodifying therapies available Supportive treatment options include the use of feeding tubes or ventilators for infants with GM1 Program selection We chose GM1 as one of our lead clinical programs because it met our criteria for rare monogenic CNS disorders in which we believe we can develop product candidates with a higher probability of technical and regulatory success and have a substantial impact on the lives of severely underserved patients GM1 offers potential crosscorrection biomarker data and preclinical validation that are supportive of advancing GM1 into the clinic  Crosscorrection  Following treatment with PBGM01 we expect newly synthesized gal to be secreted by transduced cells which could provide a depot of secreted enzyme that could be taken up by other cells resulting in the potential for crosscorrection and broad CNS and peripheral organ enzyme replacement   Biomarkers  There are known biomarkers in GM1 that are measurable and available to assist in drug development   Pharmacodynamic biomarkers In our preclinical studies biomarkers including gal activity and hexosaminidase or HEX activity showed treatmentrelated effects in PBGM01treated GLB1 knockout mice Cerebrospinal fluid or CSF collected at the time of necropsy showed gal activity exceeding that of diseasefree heterozygous control mice gal activity in the brains of PBGM01treated GLB1 knockout mice was similar to normal control mice Peripheral organs including the heart lungs liver and spleen also exhibited elevated gal activity in PBGM01treated mice   Disease progression biomarkers Recent MRI studies of infants with GM1 have shown longitudinal changes in infantile GM1 consistent with progressive brain atrophy and ventricular enlargement suggesting that brain MRI would be a useful biomarker to detect and help verify treatment effects on disease pathophysiology  12 Table of Contents  Preclinical validation We used our GLB1 knockout mouse disease model showing both clinical and histological manifestations of GM1 in preclinical studies In these studies we observed a robust doserelated improvement in both neurological status histologic lysosomal storage pathology and survival following treatment with PBGM01  Product Candidate Development Strategy We have chosen the earliest and most severe form of GM1 for clinical development for several reasons Within GM1 infantile GM1 represents the greatest medical need as affected infants often do not survive two years and thus are in immediate need of an effective therapy We expect treatmentrelated efficacy to be measurable sooner after treatment in this more rapidly progressing form of GM1 Children with onset forms of GM1 later than infantile are caused by less severe reductions of gal enzyme activity generally demonstrate slower progression and more variable clinical courses likely requiring larger and longer clinical trials and a broader control group If our initial clinical trials in infantile GM1 are successful we intend to explore expansion of the indication with trials in later onset forms of GM1 Our Product Candidate We are developing PBGM01 to treat infantile GM1 with a single dose of PBGM01 by ICM injection PBGM01 utilizes a nextgeneration AAVhu68 viral vector to deliver modified DNA encoding the gal enzyme to a patients cells The goal of this vector and delivery approach is to increase levels of the gal enzyme in both the CNS and the peripheral tissues We selected the AAVhu68 capsid and ICM route due to the superior transduction observed in cells of the CNS and peripheral organs which are both affected in GM1 disease patients Based on prior capsid comparison studies we chose the AAVhu68 vector because it has the potential to provide corrective gal enzyme to both the CNS and peripheral tissues which we believe gives us the potential to treat both the CNS pathologies and the peripheral manifestations observed in GM1 disease We believe gene replacement with PBGM01 and consequent wide brain distribution and uptake of the gal enzyme has the potential to greatly reduce the accumulation of GM1 gangliosides reversing neuronal toxicity thereby restoring developmental potential and improving the quality of life for treated patients We will evaluate this clinically by assessing prevention of further developmental regression and restoration of developmental trajectories as measured by developmental milestones using accepted clinical scales observer reported outcomes and video recordings Preclinical studies Proof of concept GLB1 Knockout Mouse Study Preclinical studies were conducted using a GLB1 knockout mouse model of GM1 mice that carry homozygous mutations in the GLB1 gene or GLB1mice The studies compared GLB1mice treated with PBGM01 GLB1mice treated with vehicle phosphatebuffered saline or PBS and diseasefree mice that are heterozygous GLB1 mutation carriers or GLB1mice treated with vehicle In this study all mice were treated at one month of age and observed until four months of age which is when GM1 mice typically develop marked gait abnormalities associated with brain GM1 ganglioside levels similar to those of infantile GM1 patients with advanced disease All mice were treated with an intracerebroventricular or ICV injection of either PBGM01 denoted in the following graphics as AAV or vehicle Ninety days after treatment all animals were euthanized and tissues collected referred to as necropsy for histological and biochemical analysis Serum gal activity was measured at various time points following treatment days 0 10 28 60 and 90 gal activity in the brain CSF and peripheral organs were evaluated at the time of necropsy The figure below shows that PBGM01treated GLB1mice had substantially higher serum gal activity following treatment than vehicletreated GLB1mice and similar gal activity to vehicle treated heterozygous control mice Elevated serum gal activity as measured in nanomolar per milliliter per hour or nmolmlh was achieved shortly after treatment for all PBGM01treated mice and persisted throughout the study for all but two PBGM01treated mice both of which exhibited antibodies against human gal 13 Table of Contents Serum gal activity The following figure shows gal activity in the brain as measured in nanomolar per milligram per hour or nmolmgh and CSF following necropsy gal activity in the PBGM01treated mice exceeded the vehicletreated GLB1mice in both the brain and the CSF Treatment with PBGM01 increased gal activity in the brain and CSF in a knockout mouse model  p005 p001 NSnot significant Statistical significance is important and when used herein is denoted by pvalues The pvalue is the probability that the reported result was achieved purely by chance for example a pvalue  0001 means that there is a less than 01 chance that the observed change was purely due to chance Generally a pvalue less than 005 is considered to be statistically significant The following figure shows gal activity in the lungs liver heart and spleen following necropsy In each organ gal activity in the PBGM01treated GLB1mice exceeded activity levels in vehicletreated GLB1 14 Table of Contents mice This data supports the potential of PBGM01 to provide corrective gal enzyme activity to peripheral organs and suggests that treatment with PBGM01 could address both the CNS and peripheral manifestations observed in GM1 patients Treatment with PBGM01 Increased gal Activity in Peripheral Organs in A Knockout Mouse Model  p001 NSnot significant We also assessed correction of brain abnormalities using biochemical and histological assays following necropsy Lysosomal enzymes are frequently upregulated in lysosomal storage diseases an observation that has been confirmed in GM1 patients Therefore we measured the activity of the lysosomal enzyme HEX in brain lysates The figure below shows that the activity of HEX in PBGM01treated GLB1mice was normalized as compared to GLB1control mice while vehicletreated GLB1mice exhibited elevated total HEX activity 15 Table of Contents Treatment with PBGM01 normalized hexosaminidase activity in brain in a knockout mouse model  p001 NSnot significant Histological analysis In addition to the knockout mouse model we also performed a histological analysis comparing PBGM01treated GLB1mice to both vehicletreated GLB1mice and GLB1control mice following necropsy We evaluated lysosomal storage lesions by staining brain sections with filipin a fluorescent molecule that binds GM1 ganglioside as well as immunostaining for lysosomalassociated membrane protein 1 Filipin staining revealed marked GM1 ganglioside accumulation in neurons of the cortex hippocampus and thalamus of the vehicletreated GLB1mice which was normalized in the GLB1mice treated with PBGM01 Immunohistochemistry demonstrated increased lysosomal membrane staining in the cortex and thalamus of vehicletreated GLB1  mice which was reduced in PBGM01treated GLB1mice similar to GLB1control mice Evaluation of TreatmentEffects on Neurological Function In order to evaluate neurological function in PBGM01treated GLB1mice gait analysis was performed at four months of age three months after PBGM01 or vehicle administration over two consecutive days using the CatWalk XT gait analysis system a commonly used assessment of motor performance in mice Average walking speed and the length of the hind paw print were quantified for each animal across at least three assessments on the second day of testing Slower speed and elongated paw prints are indicative of impaired motor performance As shown in the figure below walking speed and paw print length improved significantly in PBGM01treated GLB1mice compared to vehicletreated GLB1mice and were similar to the GLB1control mice  16 Table of Contents Treatment with PBGM01 Improved Gait Assessment in A Knockout Mouse Model p005 p001 NSnot significant Dose Ranging Pharmacology Study A pharmacology study was conducted to evaluate the minimum effective dose or MED and gal expression levels in a GLB1 knockout mouse model of GM1 following ICV administration of PBGM01 In this study GLB1  mice were ICVadministered with PBGM01 at four separate dose levels Other GLB1mice and heterozygous GLB1 mice were ICVadministered with vehicle The mice were separated into two groups with one group necropsied at day 150 or the Day 150 Group and one group necropsied at day 300 or the Day 300 Group There were twelve mice in each cohort in each group In this study ICV administration of PBGM01 resulted in stable dosedependent increases in transgene product expression in the brain and peripheral organs resolution of brain lysosomal storage lesions improvements in neurological phenotype and increased survival of GLB1mice The lowest dose evaluated is considered the MED based on statistically significant improvements in survival neurological exam scores and brain storage lesions at that dose Survival data The figure below shows survival data of each cohort in the Day 300 Group of the study All 12 vehicletreated GLB1mice were euthanized according to the study defined euthanasia criteria prior to the scheduled study endpoint due to disease progression with neurological signs characterized by ataxia tremors and limb weakness The median survival of this group was 268 days 185283 days In the lowest dose cohort five of twelve mice were euthanized due to disease progression In the second lowest dose cohort one of twelve mice was euthanized due to disease progression All mice in the two highest dose cohorts survived to the study endpoint 97 17 Table of Contents  Survival Curves Following Administration of PBGM01 or vehicle Neurological examinations A standardized neurological examination was performed in a blinded fashion every 60 days through day 240 and an average total severity score was obtained Data for the Day 150 Group and Day 300 Group were combined by treatment and genotype The figure below shows average total severity score for each cohort as of each assessment period The results of vehicletreated GLB1mice exhibited progressively higher total severity scores indicative of progressive neurological signs beginning at the day 120 assessment At the lowest dose of PBGM01 a progressive increase in the total severity score was also observed at the day 120 assessment although the total severity score was significantly lower than that of the vehicletreated GLB1mice at the same assessment point At the second lowest PBGM01 dose minimal abnormalities were detectable in seven of twelve mice at the day 240 assessment At the two highest doses of PBGM01 neurological abnormalities were not apparent and total severity scores for these groups were similar to those of the vehicletreated GLB1controls at each assessment point Neurological Examinations Through Day 240 Histological analysis A histological analysis was also performed comparing brain sections of PBGM01treated GLB1mice vehicle treated GLB1mice and vehicle treated GLB1control mice at baseline day 150 and day 300 Brain sections were stained for the lysosomal membrane protein LAMP1 and cortical cells positive for LAMP1 18 Table of Contents ie cells exhibiting lysosomal distention were quantified in scanned sections using an automated program For animals that did not survive to the scheduled day 300 necropsy due to disease progression all animals survived to day 150 brains were collected at the time of euthanasia and data are presented as part of the day 300 cohort The results of this analysis are shown in the figure below Untreated GLB1baseline mice necropsied on day 1 exhibited a higher proportion of LAMP1positive cells in the brain compared to that of untreated GLB1  baseline controls At both day 150 and day 300 PBGM01treated mice exhibited a dosedependent reduction in the proportion of LAMP1positive cells compared to vehicletreated necropsied GLB1controls At the two highest doses of PBGM01 the proportion of LAMP1positive cells were reduced to levels similar to those of vehicletreated GLB1controls at day 150 and day 300 gal activity gal activity was measured in serum on the day of dosing and every 60 days thereafter until day 240 At necropsy gal activity was measured in the brain and peripheral organs heart liver spleen lung and kidney As shown in the figure below average gal activity in serum in GLB1mice in the Day 300 Group administered the highest dose of PBGM01 was approximately 10fold greater than that of vehicletreated GLB1controls At the second highest dose of PBGM01 serum gal activity in GLB1mice was similar to that of vehicletreated GLB1controls Serum gal activity in GLB1mice for all other PBGM01 doses was similar to that of vehicletreated GLB1controls 19 Table of Contents Galactosidase Activity in Serum of Glb1 Mice Treated with PBGM01 or vehicle day 240 As shown in the figure below gal activity was detectable in the CSF of all mice evaluated GLB1mice that were administered the two highest doses of PBGM01 displayed average CSF gal activity levels exceeding that of vehicletreated GLB1controls CSF was not collected from vehicletreated GLB1mice because none survived to day 300 The shaded gray area in the figure below reflects the range of gal activity in CSF from GLB1mice based on data from ten vehicletreated animals from a prior study gal activity in CSF was generally dosedependent although gal activity appeared to be similar in the two lowest dose groups 20 Table of Contents Galactosidase Activity in CSF of PBGM01Treated GLB1mice and VehicleTreated Controls Day 300 The figures below show gal activity in the brain heart and liver following necropsy In the brain gal activity increased in a dosedependent manner in PBGM01treated GLB1mice Average gal activity for all dose groups was higher than that of the vehicletreated GLB1controls However only the two highest dose groups exhibited higher average gal activity than that of the vehicletreated GLB1controls at both assessment points Some peripheral organs also exhibited dosedependent increases in gal activity after PBGM01 administration The heart displayed dosedependent increases in gal activity resulting in average levels higher than that of vehicletreated GLB1mice at all doses However only the two highest doses restored gal activity to levels similar to or higher than that of vehicletreated GLB1controls at both assessment points The liver displayed dosedependent increases in gal activity after PBGM01 administration At all doses except the lowest dose average gal activity levels at both assessment points were higher than that of vehicletreated GLB1mice and similar to or higher than that of vehicletreated GLB1controls    21 Table of Contents Galactosidase Activity in Brain Heart and Liver of PBGM01treated GLB1Mice and VehicleTreated Controls NHP Toxicology Study A 120day good laboratory practice or GLP compliant toxicology study was conducted in NHPs to assess the safety tolerability and biodistribution and excretion shedding profile of PGM01 following ICM administration Juvenile male and female rhesus macaques received a single ICM administration of vehicle or one of three dose levels of PGM01 Animals from each cohort were euthanized either 60 or 120 days following administration Inlife evaluations included clinical observations performed daily multiple scheduled physical exams standardized neurological monitoring sensory nerve conduction studies or NCS body weights clinical pathology of the blood and CSF evaluation of serumcirculating NAbs and assessment of vector pharmacokinetics and vector excretion Animals were necropsied and tissues were harvested for a comprehensive histopathological examination measurement of Tcell responses and biodistribution analysis Key results from this study were  ICM administration of PBGM01 was welltolerated at all doses evaluated PBGM01 produced no adverse effects on clinical and behavioral signs body weight or neurological and physical examinations There were no abnormalities of blood and CSF clinical pathology related to PBGM01 administration except for a mild transient increase in CSF leukocytes in some animals  22 Table of Contents  I CM administration of PBGM01 resulted in vector distribution in the CSF and high levels of gene transfer to the brain spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia or DRG PBGM01 also reached high levels in peripheral blood and liver   Evaluation of PBGM01 DNA excretion demonstrated detectable vector DNA in urine and feces five days after administration which reached undetectable levels within 60 days   Tcell responses to the vector capsid andor human transgene product were detectable in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells andor tissue lymphocytes liver spleen bone marrow in the majority of PBGM01treated animals Tcell responses were not generally associated with any abnormal clinical or histological findings   Preexisting NAbs to the vector capsid were detected in some animals and did not appear to influence gene transfer to the brain and spinal cord although the presence of preexisting NAbs correlated with reduced hepatic gene transfer   Transgene expression and gal enzyme activity in CSF and serum of NHPs was limited by the nature of the assay which could not distinguish human gal enzyme versus endogenous rhesus gal enzyme The analysis was also complicated by the rapid loss of transgene product activity after Day 14 which was likely due to an antibody response to the human transgene product Despite these caveats gal activity in the CSF and serum was detectable in animals from all dose groups 14 days after administration of PBGM01   In the CSF animals receiving the two higher doses displayed gal activity levels that were approximately twofold and fourfold higher than the levels of vehicletreated controls respectively Furthermore expression in the CSF was not affected by the presence of preexisting NAbs to the vector capsid supporting the potential to achieve therapeutic activity in the CNS in infantile and late infantile patients with GM1 regardless of NAb status   In serum animals lacking preexisting NAbs to the vector capsid trended towards higher gal enzyme activity compared to that of either the vehicletreated controls or animals positive for preexisting NAbs to the vector capsid This result suggests the potential for therapeutic activity in peripheral organs for NAbnegative infantile and late infantile patients with GM1   PBGM01 administration resulted in asymptomatic degeneration of the trigeminal ganglia or TRG and DRG sensory neurons and their associated central and peripheral axons The severity of these lesions was typically minimal to mild These findings were not clearly dosedependent although there was a trend of more severe lesions in the middose and high dose cohorts Degeneration of sensory neuron cell bodies was less severe at day 120 than day 60 indicating that these lesions are not progressive although the subsequent axon degeneration and fibrosis may continue to evolve over several months Consistent with these findings two animals that exhibited the most severe axon loss and fibrosis of median nerves upon necropsy at day 120 had exhibited a reduction in median nerve sensory action potential amplitudes by day 28 with no subsequent progression Due to the presence of asymptomatic sensory neuron lesions in all dose groups a noobserved adverse effect level was not defined  The figures below show the degeneration in the DRG the spinal cord and median nerve axon and median nerve fibrosis as of day 120 as measured by histological analysis and scoring of severity of lesions from 0 none to 5 severe The two animals that exhibited the most severe axon loss and fibrosis with decreased sensory nerve action potential or SNAP are shown in red 23 Table of Contents Severity of DRG Spinal Cord and Median Nerve Lesions at Day 120 The figures below show the change in median

development Our clinical development plan is to start with trials in infantile GM1 and if successful explore expansion of the indication with trials in later onset forms of GM1 We expect to initiate patient enrollment of a multicenter openlabel singlearm Phase 12 clinical trial of PBGM01 in patients with a diagnosis of early and late infantile GM1 beginning in the first quarter of 2021 Our initial cohort will be in patients with late infantile GM1 and we expect to report initial 30day safety and biomarker data from this cohort midyear 2021 We plan to specifically study early and late infantile patients in separate smaller cohorts We plan to enroll a total of four cohorts of two patients each with separate doseescalation cohorts for late onset infantile GM1 patients with onset prior to 18 months in age and early onset infantile GM1 This will test a low dose that exceeds the MED as determined in our preclinical studies and a 3fold greater high dose The first cohort will be in patients diagnosed with late infantile GM1 greater than 12 months in age with low dose treatment There will be a 60day interval between subjects dosed within a cohort to allow review of biomarker and safety data before dosing the next subject Following the completion of this first cohort and review of safety outcomes we will simultaneously commence recruitment for both the high dose late infantile GM1 and the low dose early infantile GM1 cohorts Upon completion of the low dose early infantile cohort a high dose cohort will be enrolled Following these doseescalation cohorts each patient population will be enrolled into a confirmatory cohort Patients will be evaluated over two years for safety and efficacy followed by an additional 36 months of longterm follow up We expect that prespecified primary endpoints will include safety and efficacy Efficacy will be evaluated by prevention of further developmental regression and by restoration of developmental trajectories as measured by developmental milestones using accepted clinical scales observerreported outcomes and video recordings Secondary outcomes will include serum and CSF gal enzyme activity and disease progression endpoints including evaluations using EEG and MRI Our initial biomarker data will include blood and CSF gal enzyme activity While blood gal activity is generally measurable due to the normal activity levels found in blood it may be difficult to detect in the CSF due to lower normal activity levels in the CSF We are working on improving our analytical capabilities to detect lower levels of Bgal activity Due to our ICM delivery we believe that if a treatmentrelated increase in blood Bgal activity is detected this will suggest that there has also been a treatmentrelated increase in CSF gal enzyme activity Depending on the results from the dose escalation cohorts we plan to obtain input from regulatory agencies on the requirements to submit for regulatory approval for commercialization in the United States and internationally Natural History Data We are currently funding a GM1 natural history study being conducted by Penns ODC to collect prospective data on clinical disease progression in infantile and juvenile GM1 This data will be used to construct natural history patient profiles for use as matched case controls for comparison to the profiles of treated participants in our planned Phase 12 clinical trial Regulatory Designations In April 2020 the FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation or ODD and in May 2020 the FDA granted Rare Pediatric Disease Designation or RPDD to PBGM01 for the treatment of GM1 gangliosidosis We believe these designations represent an important recognition of the dire need for an effective treatment option for those suffering from GM1 The ODD grants us financial incentives to support clinical development and the potential for up to seven years of market exclusivity in the US upon regulatory approval while the under the RPDD program a sponsor who receives approval for a drug or biologic for a rare pediatric disease may qualify for a priority review voucher that may be sold or transferred In October 2020 the European Commission granted ODD to PBGM01 25 Table of Contents Clinical Trial Approvals In December 2020 the FDA notified us that our IND for PBGM01 was cleared which allows us to proceed with our clinical trial In December 2020 and January 2021 we also received approval of our CTA for our Imagine1 Trial for PBGM01 from MHRA and Health Canada respectively We have manufactured the PBGM01 clinical supply and have established a clinical supply chain to support global clinical trial including in the United States the UK and Canada  FTDPBFT02 Overview of FTDGRN FTD is one of the more common causes of earlyonset midlife dementia causing impairment in behavior language and executive function and occurs at similar frequency to Alzheimer disease in patients younger than 65 years FTD presents as a rapidly progressive clinical syndrome Changes in personal and social conduct occur in early stages of the disease including loss of inhibition apathy social withdrawal hyperorality mouthing of objects and ritualistic compulsive behaviors These symptoms are severely disabling and may lead to misdiagnosis as a psychological or emotionally based problem or in the elderly be mistaken for withdrawal or eccentricity FTD progresses to immobility and loss of speech and expression Survival averages eight years after onset of symptoms In approximately 5 to 10 of individuals with FTD the disease is caused by mutations in the granulin or GRN gene causing a deficiency of progranulin PGRN is a complex and highly conserved protein thought to have multiple roles in cell biology development and inflammation Emerging evidence suggests that PGRNs pathogenic contribution to FTD and other neurodegenerative disorders relates to a critical role in lysosomal function There are no disease modifying therapies approved for the treatment of FTD Antidepressants have been shown to manage some behavioral symptoms We engaged a thirdparty dataanalytics firm to conduct an analysis of a variety of deidentified electronic medical records Based on this analysis we estimate the prevalence of FTD in the United States to be approximately 62000 The prevalence of FTD due to GRN mutation found in literature is 5 to 10 Accordingly we estimate the prevalence of FTDGRN deficiency in the United States to be approximately 3000 to 6000 Program selection We chose FTDGRN as one of our initial lead programs because it meets our criteria for rare monogenic CNS disorders in which we believe we can develop product candidates with a higher probability of technical and regulatory success  Crosscorrection Following treatment with PBFT02 we believe overexpressing PGRN in a subset of cells in the CNS could provide a depot of secreted protein that could be taken up by surrounding cells resulting in the potential for crosscorrection and broad restoration of neuronal lysosomal function across the entire brain   Biomarkers There are known biomarkers in FTDGRN that are measurable and available to assist in drug development   Pharmacodynamic biomarkers PGRN is a secreted protein that can be measured in the CSF and plasma and it has been shown to be reduced in the CSF of human GRN mutation carriers   Disease progression biomarkers We expect to be able to use recent progress in the identification of clinical disease progression biomarkers for FTD including CSF neuroimaging and retinal biomarkers to facilitate clinical development by enabling early detection of treatment effects on disease pathophysiology 26 Table of Contents  Preclinical Validation In our preclinical studies in GRNmice ICV administration resulted in increased levels of PGRN in the CNS and CSF with resolution of lysosomal storage lesions ICM administration in NHPs which do not have the disease phenotype resulted in robust increases in PGRN levels in CNS and CSF  Our Product Candidate We are developing PBFT02 to treat FTDGRN with a single dose of PBFT02 by ICM injection PBFT02 is a gene therapy that utilizes an AAV1 viral vector to deliver a modified DNA encoding the GRN gene to a patients cells The goal of this vector and delivery approach is to provide higher than normal levels of PGRN to the CNS to overcome the progranulin deficiency in GRN mutation carriers who have been observed to have reduced CSF PGRN levels ranging from 30 to 50 of the PGRN levels observed in normal mutation noncarriers We selected the AAV1 capsid and ICM delivery route due to the superior transduction of the transgene observed in NHP studies throughout the brain including particularly high transduction of the ependymal cells that line the ventricles CSF spaces of the brain and secrete CSF which circulates around the brain Secretion of PGRN into the CSF by ependymal cells is expected to increase CSF levels of PGRN and the bioavailability of PGRN to other brain regions Preclinical studies ProofofConcept Pharmacology Mouse Model A pharmacology study was conducted in a mouse model using an AAVhu68 vector to assess whether delivery of the human GRN gene to the brain can elevate brain PGRN levels eliminate existing lysosomal storage material and reduce the upregulated lysosomal enzyme HEX activity in GRNmice shown in the figures below as knockout or KO mice which are present in the brain of GRNmice as early as two months of age Therefore we treated GRNmice at two to three months of age with an ICV injection of either an AAVhu68 vector expressing human GRN shown in the figures below as AAV or PBS vehicle with ten mice in each group In addition a cohort of ten wild type or WT mice were injected with vehicle Animals were euthanized 60 days after injection and necropsy was performed Biomarker Evaluation The level of human PGRN protein in the brain and CSF in nanograms per milliliter or ngmL was measured using an enzymelinked immunosorbent assay or ELISA to determine transduction levels As shown in the figure below on the right measurable levels of human PGRN were confirmed in the brain in the AAVtreated group while in both the vehicletreated and wild type groups human PGRN was below detection levels We further evaluated PGRN protein levels in the CSF as shown in the figure below on the left AAVtreated mice displayed a higher average CSF concentration of human PGRN than both the vehicletreated and wild type groups  27 Table of Contents AAV Mediated Expression of Human PGRN hPGRN Protein in the CSF and Brain Histological analysis After confirming PGRN protein expression in the brain of GRNmice we assessed whether PGRN overexpression reduced the number of lipofuscin deposits in the hippocampus thalamus and cortex As shown in the figure below AAVtreated GRNmice exhibited fewer lipofuscin deposits indicated by fluorescent spots in all brain regions compared to those of vehicletreated GRNmice and comparable lipofuscin deposits to wildtype mice Comparison of Lipofuscin Deposits in the Brain p005 p0001 p00001 28 Table of Contents Vector Comparison Study in NonHuman Primates PBFT02 utilizes an AAV1 vector to deliver to the brain a functional GRN gene encoding progranulin The AAV1 vector was chosen over other potential vectors because it demonstrated a high tropism for the ependymal cells that line the brain ventricles in NHP studies A study was conducted that was designed to evaluate the expression of human PGRN protein in the CSF of adult NHPs following ICM delivery of different AAV vectors The primary goal of the study was to determine whether ICM AAV delivery could achieve CSF PGRN levels similar to those demonstrated to be pharmacologically active in the knockout mouse model and to identify the vector capsid and transgene sequence that achieved the most robust expression In the study adult rhesus macaques received a single ICM injection of an AAV1 AAV5 or AAVhu68 vector expressing human GRN  with two NHPs per group The AAVhu68 v2 vector utilized a different GRN coding sequence and different promoter than what was used in the other vectors evaluated Human PGRN protein was measured by enzymelinked immunosorbent assay in the CSF and plasma Increasing expression of PGRN outside of the CNS should not be required for the treatment of FTDGRN and the levels of PGRN protein in plasma was measured to ascertain if any of the vectors disproportionality increased PGRN outside of the CSF which could cause potentially undesirable side effects The figures below show that production of human PGRN protein in the CSF of all treated NHPs exceeded levels found in healthy normal human control samples Production was highest in the CSF of NHPs treated with the AAV1 vector resulting in concentrations more than 50fold higher than normal human CSF PGRN concentrations PGRN production in plasma was similar to normal human control levels for the AAVhu68 and AAV1 vectors Plasma analysis was not performed on the AAVhu68 v2 group Production of Human PGRN Protein in CSF and Plasma of NHPs following ICM AAV Delivery In this NHP study animals were necropsied 28 days after vector administration Ependymal cell transduction was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in multiple regions of the brain of animals treated with AAVhu68 and animals treated with AAV1 As shown in the figure below transduction of the ependymal cells as shown by density of darkened ependymal cells was substantially higher in the animals treated with AAV1 48 as compared to the animals treated with AAVhu68 12 29 Table of Contents Ependymal cell transduction following ICM delivery of AAV1 and AAVhu68 vectors expressing GFP in NHPs Based on the results from the NHP vector comparison study we selected AAV1 as the capsid for our PBFT02 product candidate In our NHP preclinical studies the production of PGRN using a AAV1 capsid was 3 to 5 times greater than AAVhu68 and AAV5 Thus we believe PBFT02 has the potential to provide a large CNS depot of progranulin that could be taken up by neurons broadly throughout the brain restoring lysosomal function and neuronal survival thereby slowing or stopping progression of the FTD Further AAV1 does not strongly transduce the liver and does not result in comparatively elevated levels of circulating PGRN This may be an advantage by reducing the potential risk of unknown side effects of PGRN outside the CNS GRN mutation carriers have been demonstrated to have reduced CSF progranulin levels ranging from 30 to 50 of the PGRN levels observed in normal mutation noncarriers Based on our preclinical studies we believe that PBFT02 has the potential to sufficiently increase extracellular PGRN levels to overcome intracellular PGRN deficiency without greatly increasing peripheral PGRN levels Pharmacology Study in GRN  mice to determine the Minimally Effective Dose A pharmacology study was conducted to evaluate the MED in a GRN  mouse model following ICV administration of PBFT02 In this study GRN  mice at 65 to 85 months old were administered PBFT02 at four separate dose levels and evaluated for 90 days Other GRN mice and wildtype mice were administered with vehicle The initial age of administration was chosen because at this age increased lipofuscin deposits and upregulated lysosomal HEX activity are observed in the brain of GRN mice This age also allowed evaluation of neuroinflammation which develops later in disease progression by 5 months of age Thus these mice mirror the developmental stage of the intended patient population youngmature adult to middleage adult and allow evaluation of diseaserelevant neuropathological features As GRN  mice do not exhibit overt neurodegeneration or neurological symptoms and they have a normal lifespan the study duration was 90 days The study duration was chosen to allow for evaluation following the expected onset peak and plateau of transgene expression Ninety days also allowed for detection of changes in the biochemical and neuropathological findings already present in the GRN mice at the time of PBFT02 administration and was considered a sufficient duration for detecting posttreatment improvement in diseaserelevant phenotypes In this study administration of PBFT02 to GRN  mice resulted in a doserelated correction of histopathology with the broadest treatmentrelated effects on lipofuscin neuroinflammation and lysosomal enzyme activity observed at the highest dose The lowest dose of PBFT02 was considered to be the minimally effective dose as it significantly improved key neuropathological features found in patients with GRN related neurodegeneration including prevention of lipofuscin accumulation in the thalamus and a reduction in neuroinflammation defined by CD68 expression in the hippocampus PGRN expression Human PGRN expression was measured in the CSF of necropsied mice 90 days after PBFT02 administration As shown in the figure below human PGRN expression in CSF increased at the two highest doses of PBFT02 compared to that of vehicletreated GRN controls Human PGRN expression in GRN mice administered the two lowest doses of PBFT02 appeared similar to that of the vehicletreated GRN mice and wild type controls However the limit of detection or LOD for the PGRN ELISA assay was 125 ngmL thus limiting the ability to detect changes in PGRN expression at the two lowest doses and in the vehicletreated GRN and wild type controls  30 Table of Contents PRGN Expression in CSF of GRN Mice Administered PBFT02 or Vehicle Histological Analysis of Brain Abnormalities The thalamus cortex and hippocampus were selected for quantification of lipofuscin deposits and CD68 expression because elevated lipofuscin accumulation and neuroinflammationmicrogliosis are evident in these brain regions in GRN mice Furthermore these brain regions exhibit extensive neuropathology in patients with GRN related neurodegeneration Lipofuscin deposits Lipofuscin deposits were quantified in three brain regions thalamus cortex and hippocampus of mice necropsied at baseline and 90 days after PBFT02 administration or Day 90 The figures below show that at both baseline and Day 90 lipofuscin deposits were more abundant in the thalamus compared to the cortex and hippocampus suggesting that the thalamus might provide greater sensitivity for evaluating lipofuscin aggregates than the other brain regions In the thalamus a higher baseline lipofuscin count was observed in untreated GRN mice than in untreated wild type controls At Day 90 the average lipofuscin count in vehicletreated GRN mice was higher than that of the untreated GRN baseline controls indicating a progressive increase in lipofuscin deposits In contrast all PBFT02treated groups displayed significantly lower lipofuscin counts than that of vehicletreated GRN mice Because average lipofuscin counts in all PBFT02treated groups were similar to that of the untreated GRN  baseline controls PBFT02 administration at all dose levels appeared to prevent the progressive accumulation of lipofuscin during the 90day study In the cortex and hippocampus higher average lipofuscin counts were also observed in vehicletreated GRN  mice than in vehicletreated wild type mice at Day 90 All PBFT02treated dose groups displayed fewer average lipofuscin counts at Day 90 than vehicletreated GRN mice although the reduction was only statistically significant in the cortex at the third highest dose No dosedependent response was observed as lipofuscin counts were similar among all four PBFT02 dose groups 31 Table of Contents Quantification of Lipofuscin Deposits in the Brain of GRN Mice Administered PBFT02 or Vehicle p005 p001 p0001 p00001 Neuroinflammation The neuroinflammatory marker CD68 was quantified in three brain regions thalamus cortex and hippocampus of necropsied mice at baseline and 90 days after PBFT02 administration The figures below show that at baseline and on Day 90 higher average CD68 expression was observed in the thalamus cortex and hippocampus of untreated GRN mice when compared to that of untreated wild type controls In the thalamus on Day 90 a generally dosedependent response was observed with the three highest PBFT02 dose groups displaying significantly reduced CD68 expression compared to that of vehicletreated GRN mice Of note mice administered the highest dose of PBFT02 exhibited an approximately 4fold reduction in CD68 expression compared to that of vehicletreated GRN mice In the cortex on Day 90 average CD68 expression was reduced in all PBFT02treated groups although the reduction was not significantly different from CD68 expression in the vehicletreated GRN mice No dosedependent response was observed In the hippocampus on Day 90 all PBFT02 dose groups displayed significantly lower CD68 expression compared to that of vehicletreated GRN mice Moreover CD68 expression was similar to that of vehicletreated wild type controls for all doses of PBFT02 This response was not dosedependent as expression of CD68 was similar at all doses of PBFT02    32 Table of Contents Quantification of CD68 Expression in the Brain of GRN Mice Administered PBFT02 or Vehicle p005 p001 p0001 and p00001 Lysosomal Enzyme Activity Hexosaminidase Activity A HEX activity assay was performed at baseline and 90 days after PBFT02 administration on lysates of the third frontal part of the brain because lysosomal enzymes are frequently upregulated in lysosomal storage diseases an observation that has been confirmed in GM1 patients At baseline brain HEX activity was higher in untreated GRN mice than untreated wild type controls At Day 90 GRN mice administered the highest PBFT02 dose exhibited significantly reduced brain HEX activity compared to that of vehicletreated GRN mice Moreover HEX activity in the highest dose group was similar to that of vehicletreated wild type controls indicating normalization of brain HEX levels at this dose NHP Toxicology Study A 90day GLPcompliant toxicology study was conducted in NHPs to assess the safety tolerability and biodistribution and excretion shedding profile of PBFT02 following ICM administration 33 Table of Contents In this study adult male and female rhesus macaques received a single ICM administration of vehicle or PBFT02 at one of three dose levels Animals from each cohort were euthanized 90 days following administration Inlife evaluations included clinical observations performed daily standardized neurological monitoring sensory nerve conduction studies or NCS body weights clinical pathology of the blood and CSF evaluation of serumcirculating NAbs to the vector capsid and assessment of vector pharmacokinetics and vector excretion Animals were necropsied and tissues were harvested for a comprehensive histopathological examination measurement of T cell responses to the vector capsid and transgene product biodistribution analysis and evaluation of human PGRN expression and antihuman PGRN antibody responses Key results from this study were  ICM administration of PBFT02 was welltolerated at all doses evaluated All animals survived to the scheduled necropsy and PBFT02 produced no adverse effects on clinical and behavioral signs body weights or neurologic examinations There were no abnormalities of blood or CSF clinical pathology related to PBFT02 administration except for a mild transient increase in CSF leukocytes in some animals  As shown in the figures below PBFT02 administration resulted in asymptomatic degeneration of DRG and TRG sensory neurons 8 of 9 animals along with their associated central and peripheral axons 9 of 9 animals The severity of most of these lesions was minimal to mild These findings showed a trend of more severe lesions in the middose and high dose groups Of the two animals that exhibited the most severe axon loss in the spinal cord and endoneurial fibrosis of peripheral nerves one animal in the high dose group displayed a marked reduction in bilateral median nerve sensory action potential amplitudes on Day 90   Preexisting NAbs to the vector capsid were detectable in serum in 3 of 11 animals 27 at baseline and did not appear to influence gene transfer to the brain and spinal cord although the presence of preexisting NAbs correlated with markedly reduced hepatic gene transfer T cell responses to the vector capsid or human transgene product were detectable in the majority of PBFT02treated animals in 34 Table of Contents peripheral blood mononuclear cells or tissue lymphocytes from the liver or spleen T cell responses were not generally associated with abnormal clinical findings   ICM administration of PBFT02 resulted in vector distribution in the CSF and high levels of gene transfer to the brain spinal cord and DRG at Day 90 PBFT02 also reached significant concentrations in the peripheral blood l l iver and spleen Evaluation of PBFT02 vector DNA excretion demonstrated detectable vector DNA in urine and feces 5 days after administration which reached undetectable levels within 60 days  Human PGRN expression was detectable in CSF and serum in all animals by 7 to 14 days after PBFT02 administration Human PGRN expression peaked between Days 14 to 28 in CSF and serum and was generally dosedependent By Day 60 human PGRN expression in the CSF and serum declined from peak levels in all PBFT02treated animals This decline correlated with the appearance of antibodies against the transgene product ie antihuman PGRN antibodies which are not expected to develop in haploinsufficient patients with FTDGRN in both CSF and serum of all PBFT02treated animals A comparison of the maximum expression of human PGRN in the CSF of NHPs to that of healthy human CSF showed that the mid and high doses of PBFT02 dose resulted in approximately 15fold higher PGRN expression than that of healthy human CSF while the lower dose of PBFT02 dose resulted in approximately 7fold higher PGRN expression than that of healthy human CSF We believe these pharmacology data support the possibility of achieving therapeutic PGRN expression levels and crosscorrection in the CNS of FTD patients following ICM administration of PBFT02 Human PGRN protein Clinical development Our clinical development plan is to treat FTDGRN with a single dose of PBFT02 via ICM injection with our initial clinical trial focused on early symptomatic FTD patients who have the GRN mutation  We have an active IND for PBFT02 and plan to initiate patient enrollment of a multicenter openlabel singlearm Phase 12 dose escalation clinical trial of PBFT02 in patients with a diagnosis of FTD with a GRN mutation beginning in the United States in the first half of 2021 We expect to report initial 30day safety and biomarker data from the first cohort in late 2021 or early 2022 This trial is expected to be a twocohort doseescalation trial with three subjects per cohort and the potential for a third higherdose cohort The planned starting dose will exceed the MED in the GRN knockout mouse model with planned escalation to a 3fold higher dose The primary endpoint of the trial is to assess safety and tolerability over 60 months Secondary endpoints are to assess change from baseline to 24 months on biomarkers including CSF and plasma progranulin levels biomarkers of neurodegeneration and disease progression and on clinical outcomes as measured by the Clinical Dementia Rating CDR for improving evaluation of patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration FTLD or CDR plus NACC FTLD and other neurocognitive assessments Interim analyses are planned for certain biomarkers starting at one month post dosing and for clinical outcomes beginning at one year post dosing The independent data monitoring committee or IDMC will 35 Table of Contents review 30day biomarker data and safety data for each subject in a cohort All subjects will be followed for a total of five years to monitor safety and selected biomarker and efficacy measures All subjects will be evaluated over two years for safety and efficacy followed by an additional 36 months of longterm follow up  A scientific advice meeting with MHRA was held in November 2020 providing feedback on our proposed protocol We also intend to seek feedback from other regulatory agencies outside the United States  Depending on the results from the initial cohorts we plan to obtain input from regulatory agencies on the requirements to submit for regulatory approval for commercialization in the United States and internationally  Regulatory designations In January 2021 the FDA granted ODD to PBFT02 for the treatment of FTDGRN We believe this designation represents an important recognition of the dire need for an effective treatment option for those suffering from FTDGRN The ODD grants us financial incentives to support clinical development and the potential for up to seven years of market exclusivity in the United States upon regulatory approval The FDA has recently granted Fast Track designation for PBFT02 Fast Track designation is a process designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs to treat conditions and fill unmet medical need Clinical Trial Approvals In January 2021 the FDA notified us that our IND for PBFT02 was cleared which allows us to proceed with our clinical trial We have manufactured the PBFT02 clinical supply to support clinical trial initiation in the United States Krabbe diseasePBKR03 Overview of Krabbe disease Krabbe disease is a rare and often lifethreatening lysosomal storage disease that presents early the patients life resulting in progressive damage to both the brain and PNS Infants may present with extreme irritability and excessive crying feeding difficulties fisted hands poor head control stiffness and arching The early infantile form of Krabbe disease typically manifests before six months of age and is the most severe form accounting for 60 to 70 of Krabbe disease diagnoses In these patients the disease course is highly predictable and rapidly progresses to include loss of acquired milestones staring episodes apnea peripheral neuropathy severe weakness unresponsiveness to stimuli seizures blindness deafness and death by two years of age Late infantile patients present symptoms that are similar to those of early infantile Krabbe disease with a median survival of approximately five years from onset of symptoms Late infantile Krabbe disease is defined by onset between seven to twelve months of age It comprises approximately 10 to 30 of cases and exhibits greater variability in clinical presentation Krabbe disease is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease caused by mutations in the GALC gene which provides instructions for making an enzyme called galactosylceramidase which breaks down certain fats including galactosylceramide and psychosine The myelinproducing cells in the CNS and PNS are particularly sensitive to the accumulation of psychosine resulting in widespread death of these cell populations Without myelin nerves in both the brain and other parts of the body cannot transmit signals properly leading to the signs and symptoms of Krabbe disease There are currently limited treatment options for patients with Krabbe disease While human stem cell transplant or HSCT has become standard of care in many centers in the US for early infantile Krabbe patients who are presymptomatic or who have mild symptoms it has limited use outside the US and is a treatment with limitations Most HSCTtreated children still have progressive gross motor delays ranging from mild spasticity to inability to walk independently and limited use of their upper extremities There is also a narrow window of treatment and of course a donor must be identified When performed after the onset of overt symptoms in these patients HSCT provides only minimal neurologic improvement and does not substantially improve survival 36 Table of Contents Currently nine states conduct mandatory screening for Krabbe disease and an additional four states passed legislation to include Krabbe disease in mandatory screening but such screening has not yet been added We engaged a third party dataanalytics firm to conduct an analysis of screening data from the six states with screening history and based on this evaluation of screening data we believe the incidence of Krabbe disease to be approximately 26 in 100000 births Program Selection We chose infantile Krabbe disease as one of our first clinical programs because it met our criteria for rare monogenic CNS disorders in which we believe we can develop product candidates with a higher probability of technical and regulatory success The indication presents crosscorrection biomarker data and preclinical validation that are supportive of advancing treatments for Krabbe disease into the clinic  CrossCorrection Following treatment with PBKR03 newly synthesized galactosylceramidase is expected to be secreted by transduced cells potentially providing a depot of secreted enzyme that could be taken up by other cells resulting in the potential for crosscorrection and broad CNS and PNS enzyme replacement   Biomarkers There are known biomarkers in Krabbe disease that are measurable and available to assist in drug development   Pharmacodynamic biomarkers GALC activity has been shown to be reduced in patients with Krabbe disease and can be measured in CSF and plasma Psychosine levels are also measurable and elevated in patients with Krabbe disease We will measure these biomarkers in CSF and plasma to assess the efficiency of transduction and restoration of GALC activity by PBKR03   Disease progression biomarkers We will leverage a number of neuroimaging electrophysiological and fluid biomarkers to assess treatment effects on disease progression including CNS myelination as measured by diffusiontensor MRI nerve conduction velocity or NCV to assess peripheral nerve myelin and conduction and visual and brain stemevoked potentials to assess CNS myelination and conduction   Preclinical validation In preclinical studies in a mouse model of Krabbe disease CSF delivery of PBKR03 resulted in GALC expression levels in the CNS that rescued motor function and improved survival CSF delivery in mice also reduced peripheral nerve demyelination and globoid cell infiltration Our Product Candidate We are developing PBKR03 to treat infantile Krabbe disease the most common and severe form of Krabbe disease PBKR03 utilizes a nextgeneration AAVhu68 capsid to deliver DNA encoding the GALC enzyme to a patients cells PBKR03 will be administered as a single dose by ICM injection into the CSF The AAVhu68 capsid and ICM route of administration were selected for the superior transduction observed in preclinical studies for cells of the CNS and PNS which are both affected in Krabbe disease patients This vector has the potential to provide corrective GALC enzyme to both the CNS and PNS which we believe could treat both the CNS pathologies and the significant peripheral neuropathy observed in many Krabbe disease patients Preclinical studies Vector Selection Study in PreSymptomatic Twitcher Mice A proof of concept study was conducted in presymptomatic twitcher mice to establish the route of administration capsid and dose range best suited for treating infantile Krabbe disease A twitcher mouse denoted in the following figures as twitwi is a naturallyoccurring mouse mutant caused by an abnormality in the gene coded for galactosylceramidase and therefore is genetically equivalent to Krabbe disease Four different AAV capsids encoding human GALC were tested AAV3b AAV5 AAV1 and AAVhu68 Each AAV vector was administered ICV As a control a group of presymptomatic twitcher mice were administered PBS vehicle only As shown in the figure below while all four capsids enhanced survival compared to the vehicletreated control mice the AAVhu68 capsid yielded superior survival over AAV3b AAV5 and AAV1 Therefore we selected the AAVhu68 capsid for subsequent studies  37 Table of Contents  Survival Curves Following ICV Delivery of GALC to Presymptomatic Twitcher Mice Using Different AAV Capsids Pharmacodynamic Study in Twitcher Mice After selecting our AAVhu68 capsid for use we then used the twitcher mouse model to examine treatment effects of PBKR03 In preclinical studies PBKR03 was delivered into the CSF by ICV injection 38 Table of Contents As shown in the figures below 28 days after ICV administration of PBKR03 GALC activity levels observed in the brain liver and serum of PBKR03treated twitcher mice were higher than the levels observed in the same tissues of vehicletreated twitcher mice and healthy control mice denoted by  in the figure below Pharmacology Study in Twitcher Mice A pharmacology study in earlysymptomatic twitcher twitwi mice was also conducted Twitcher mice were ICVadministered PBKR03 on postnatal day or PND 12 Other agematched early symptomatic twitcher mice unaffected heterozygotes twi   and wildtype  mice were ICVadministered PBS vehicle only on PND 12 PND 12 was selected as the day of dosing because it is shortly after the onset of PNS demyelination in an animal with brain maturation equivalent to a 2monthold infant Beginning ten days after administration all mice were monitored daily for clinical signs Clinical signs were scored using an assessment of clasping ability gait tremor kyphosis and fur quality These measures effectively assess the clinical status of subject mice based upon the symptoms they typically present Scores above 0 indicate clinical deterioration Using this assessment earlysymptomatic twitwi mice administered PBKR03 displayed clinical scores close to 0 which was comparable to the scores of unaffected twi  and  mice as shown in the figure below In contrast the agematched vehicletreated twitwi mice displayed higher assessment scores over most of the time course indicating clinical deterioration 39 Table of Contents Clinical Scoring As a complementary functional assay the rotarod test a commonly used test to evaluate motor coordination in mice was performed on PND 35 As shown in the figure below the early symptomatic PBKR03treated twitwi mice displayed fall latencies comparable to those of the unaffected twi  and  mice while the age matched vehicletreated twitwi mice displayed statistically significantly shorter fall latencies p005 indicating deterioration of neuromotor function 40 Table of Contents Complementary Functional Assay Rotarod Day 35Symptomatic Treatment To determine whether the observed benefits of PBKR03 administration on functional endpoints correlated with histologic improvements all mice were necropsied 28 days following ICV administration and the sciatic nerve of the hind limb was examined histologically The sciatic nerve was selected for histology because peripheral nerves are more affected by demyelination in twitwi mice compared to the CNS As shown in the figures below the sciatic nerve of vehicletreated  controls was enriched with myelin dark blue staining and generally devoid of globoid cell infiltrates pink staining However in vehicletreated symptomatic twitwi mice severe subtotal demyelination was observed in the sciatic nerve accompanied by nerve thickening and the infiltration of globoid cells In contrast myelin was preserved in the sciatic nerve of symptomatic PBKR03treated twitwi mice although not to the extent observed in agematched  mice Fewer globoid cells were also observed in the nerve of PBKR03treated twitwi mice compared to vehicle treated twitwi mice Sciatic Nerve Histology Following ICV Administration of PBKR03 to Symptomatic Twitcher Mice Pharmacology Study in Twitcher Mouse Model to determine the Minimally Effective Dose A pharmacology study was conducted to determine the MED and GALC expression levels in the twitcher mouse model of infantile Krabbe disease following ICV administration of PBKR03 In this study juvenile twitwi mice 41 Table of Contents postnatal day or PND 10 to 14 received a single administration of PBKR03 at one of four dose levels Additional twi  twi mice and wild type mice were administered either vehicle or remained untreated as controls The age of the animals was selected to model the disease stage of earlysymptomatic infantile Krabbe disease patients In this study the MED was determined to be the third highest dose out of four because this dose led to significant improvements in survival body wasting and failure to thrive body weight loss Krabbe diseaserelated clinical symptoms clinical assessment scoring and the prevention of phenotypic lymphopenia suggestive of a reduction in autonomic neuronal degeneration when compared to vehicletreated controls This dose increased myelination and reduced globoid cell infiltration and neuroinflammation in the brain while also reducing globoid cell size in the brain and spinal cord compared to that seen in vehicletreated controls This dose was also the minimal dose leading to significantly increased GALC enzyme expression in the brain which is a key target tissue Naturally occurring Krabbe dog model The Krabbe dog is a naturally occurring autosomal recessive disease model derived from a spontaneous mutation in the GALC gene The mutant GALC protein has residual enzymatic activity close to 0 which is similar to GALC activity levels observed in patients with the infantile form of Krabbe disease A preclinical study was conducted in the Krabbe dog model evaluating treatment with an AAVhu68 vector containing a codonoptimized canine GALC cDNA which we refer to as AAVtreated dogs or vehicle administered directly to the CSF using the ICM route of administration In this study four Krabbe dogs were treated with a single administration of PBKR03 two Krabbe dogs were treated with a sham and one wild type control dog was also treated with a sham Survival The two vehicletreated Krabbe dogs reached the predefined humane endpoint characterized by severe hind limb weakness and inability to stand and walk on Day 35 or Day 66 which was consistent with the natural history of the disease In contrast all four PBKR03treated dogs maintained normal motor function and did not reach the predefined humane endpoint associated with hind limb paralysis One of the AAVtreated dogs was euthanized following a suspected seizure at 39 weeks Prior to seizure the animal exhibited normal phenotype The pathology report revealed Krabberelated lesions of demyelination and globoid cell infiltration that were less pronounced than vehicletreated Krabbe dog controls and similar to the two treated dogs from the 28 weeks scheduled necropsy timepoint The spinal cord and peripheral nerve showed no demyelination suggesting treatment effect was maintained and consistent with normal motor function of this animal prior to the seizure Another of the AAVtreated dogs was euthanized at 195 months 82 weeks of age due to body weight loss The body weight loss was a result of recurrent vomiting and regurgitation Following necropsy and histopathology of this dog moderate demyelination and globoid cell infiltration of the vagus nerve and moderate atrophy of the esophageal myenteric plexus was observed Autonomic nerve vagus nerve dysfunction may be Krabbe diseaserelated and have contributed to weight loss in this dog GALC expression As shown in the figure below CSF GALC enzyme activity was detectable above baseline levels measured on Day 0 in all AAVtreated Krabbe dogs by 28 days post treatment Levels were maintained at or above vehicletreated wild type GALC activity levels for the duration of the study for each AAVtreated Krabbe dog including up to 195 months post treatment Expression levels in AAVtreated Krabbe dogs remained relatively stable for the duration of the study in most animals except Animal K933 which exhibited a notable peak in GALC enzyme activity on Day 28 followed by a decline to stable levels by Day 100 through 195 months post treatment Finally at Day 28 and Day 70 GALC enzyme activity levels in all AAVtreated Krabbe dogs exceeded that of the vehicletreated controls prior to humane euthanasia 42 Table of Contents CSF GALC activityAAVtreated Psychosine levels in CSF Psychosine was undetectable in the CSF of vehicletreated wild type dogs from Day 0 through Day 180 post treatment While psychosine was undetectable in the CSF of both vehicletreated Krabbe dogs at baseline Day 0 psychosine became elevated in both animals on Day 28 and levels increased further by the time of humane euthanasia Elevations in psychosine correlated with the onset and progression of neurological symptoms in the vehicletreated Krabbe dogs In contrast psychosine was undetectable at most time points for all four AAVtreated Krabbe dogs One animal exhibited undetectable levels of psychosine at all time points evaluated while either mild or transient elevations were observed for the other animals Nerve Conduction Studies As shown in the figures below periodic NCV recordings demonstrated slowed or undetected signals in shamtreated Krabbe dogs while all four AAVtreated Krabbe dogs had normalized velocities similar to the wild type control dog 43 Table of Contents Nerve Conduction Velocities in Motor and Sensory Nerves Brainstem auditory evoked response BAER pathway central conduction As hearing loss is common during Krabbe disease progression hearing threshold under the Brainstem Auditory Evoked Response or BAER test was evaluated Hearing threshold could not be determined  90 dB in one vehicletreated Krabbe dog but were similar to the vehicletreated wild type dog in the other vehicletreated Krabbe dog All the treated Krabbe dogs had hearing thresholds similar to the vehicletreated wild type dog for the entire duration of the study until euthanized at 195 months 82 weeks of age Histological Analysis A histological analysis evaluating myelination and neuroinflammation levels was also conducted As shown in the figures below all four AAVtreated Krabbe dogs exhibited increased myelination and reduced globoid cell infiltration in the brain spinal cord and peripheral nerves by histology when compared to the vehicletreated Krabbe dogs 44 Table of Contents  SemiQuantitative Scoring of Demyelination and Globoid Cell Infiltration in the Nervous System of Krabbe Dogs Following ICM Administration of AAV 45 Table of Contents Body Weights As shown in the figure below growth and body weight gain were normal in all treated dogs One AAVtreated dog was euthanized due to weight body loss at 195 months of age 82 weeks Age weeks Body Weight Curve Further as shown in the figure below after day 70 none of the dogs exhibited meaningful CSF pleocytosis or increase in white cell count with normal wildtype dog levels shown by the dotted line There were no treatmentrelated histopathological lesions at 6 months in the AAVtreated Krabbe dogs Clinical pathology hematology and clinical chemistry Three AAVtreated Krabbe dogs presented a mild and transient lymphocytosis 2 weeks postinjection This finding is possibly treatmentrelated as it was not observed in the vehicletreated Krabbe or wild type animals It is not considered adverse due to low grade elevation and transient nature 46 Table of Contents There was no vector related modification of coagulation parameters nor serum clinical chemistry Two AAVtreated Krabbe dogs presented transient mild CSF mononuclear pleocytosis 4 weeks postinjection This finding is vector related and not considered adverse as it was selflimited and not accompanied by any neurological signs GLP NHP Toxicology Study A 180day GLPcompliant toxicology study was conducted in NHPs to assess the safety tolerability and biodistribution and excretion shedding profile of PBKR03 following ICM administration Juvenile male and female rhesus macaques received a single ICM administration of PBKR03 at one of 3 doses low med high Animals from each cohort were euthanized either 90 or 180 days following administration Inlife evaluations included clinical observations performed daily physical exams standardized neurological monitoring sensory NCS body weights clinical pathology of the blood and CSF evaluation of serumcirculating NAbs assessment of vector pharmacokinetics and vector excretion and evaluation of GALC enzyme expression and antibodies against antihuman GALC antibodies in CSF and serum Key results from this study were  ICM administration of PBKR03 was welltolerated at all doses evaluated PBKR03 produced no adverse effects on clinical and behavioral signs body weights or neurologic and physical examinations There were no abnormalities of blood and CSF clinical pathology related to PBKR03 administration except for an asymptomatic mild transient increase in CSF leukocytes in some animals   As shown in the figures below PBKR03 administration resulted in minimal sporadic degeneration of primarily DRG sensory neurons which led to a secondary degeneration of the associated central and peripheral axons axonopathy The DRG lesions were absent in some animals and minimal in severity when present Secondary axonopathy associated with DRG lesions while dosedependent was mostly minimal to mild These findings were dosedependent with a trend of more severe lesions in the middose and high dose groups The DRG findings and corresponding axonopathy were similar at Day 90 and Day 180 suggesting lack of progression In the majority of the NHPs findings were asymptomatic A single animal in the high dose group exhibited a unilateral reduction in SNAP amplitudes in the left median nerve by Day 28 which correlated with endoneurial fibrosis in association with axonopathy in the left median nerve found at necropsy on Day 90 that correlated with a unilateral reduction in SNAP amplitudes in the left median nerve by Day 28 Due to the presence of asymptomatic sensory neuron lesions in all dose groups the noobservedadverseeffect level was not defined 47 Table of Contents Sensory Nerve Conduction Studies  Preexisting NAbs to the vector capsid were detectable in serum in 11 of 18 PBKR03treated animals at baseline and NAb responses to the AAVhu68 capsid were subsequently observed in 18 of 18 PBKR03treated animals by Day 28 Preexisting NAbs to the vector capsid did not lead to abnormal clinical or histopathological findings   T cell responses to the vector capsid or human transgene product were detectable in the majority of PBKR03treated animals 15 of 18 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells or tissue lymphocytes T cell responses to the human transgene product were more frequent and of higher magnitude than T cell responses to the vector capsid T cell responses to the vector capsid were not affected by the presence of preexisting NAbs to the vector capsid T cell responses to the vector capsid or human transgene product were generally not associated with any abnormal clinical or histopathological findings   GALC enzyme activity in CSF and serum was detectable in animals from all dose groups from the first time point evaluated In CSF animals receiving the two higher doses displayed GALC activity levels that were approximately twofold and 175fold higher than the levels of vehicletreated animals respectively In serum animals in all three dose groups exhibited GALC activity levels that were approximately 2fold 57fold and 66fold higher than the levels of vehicletreated animals respectively   Transgene product expression in CSF and serum was not affected by the presence of preexisting NAbs to the vector capsid which we believe supports the potential to achieve therapeutic activity in the target organ systems CNS and PNS in Krabbe disease patients regardless of NAb status However rapid loss of measurable transgene product activity was observed which was attributable to an NHP antibody response to the foreign human transgene product in CSF and serum This humoral response to the foreign human transgene product was not associated with abnormal clinical or histopathological findings Clinical development Our clinical development plan is to start with trials in early infantile Krabbe disease and if successful consider further exploration of expansion of the indication with trials in later onset forms of Krabbe disease 48 Table of Contents We believe gene replacement with PBKR03 could significantly reduce the accumulation of galactolipids such as galactocerebroside that often leads to demyleniation in both the CNS and PNS or reduction in toxic glycosphingolipids of psychosine reversing neuronal toxicity resulting in meaningful clinical benefit to patients We will measure clinical benefit by prevention of further developmental regression and by restoration of developmental trajectories as measured by developmental milestones using accepted clinical scales observerreported outcomes and video recordings  We have an active IND for PBKR03 and plan to initiate patient enrollment of a multicenter openlabel singlearm Phase 12 doseescalation clinical trial of PBKR03 in patients with a diagnosis of early infantile Krabbe disease GALC mutations and reduced enzyme activity beginning in the United States in the first half of 2021 We intend this trial to have two independent dose escalation cohorts three subjects per dose based on age at enrolment dosing initially in subjects  4 and  9 months of age with dose escalation and initiation of dosing in subjects  1 and  4 months of age gated by safety in cohort 1 Planned starting doses for each cohort will exceed the MED in the twitcher mouse model with planned escalation to a 3fold higher dose followed by a third confirmatory cohort We expect to report initial 30day safety and biomarker data from the first cohort in late 2021 or early 2022 The primary endpoint of the trial is to assess safety and tolerability over 60 months Secondary endpoints are to assess change from baseline to 24 months on biomarkers including CSF and plasma GALC activity and psychosine and biomarkers of disease progression and on clinical outcomes as assessed using by the Bayley Scale of Infant and Toddler Development and other developmental scales Interim analyses are planned for certain biomarkers starting at one month post dosing All subjects will be evaluated over two years for safety and efficacy followed by an additional 36 months of longterm follow up We have also received feedback from the EMA regarding our preclinical studies and proposed clinical trial In collaboration with Penns ODC we are also currently planning to develop comparator data sets for our Krabbe clinical trial Clinical understanding of Krabbe disease has been summarized in several case studies and natural history studies Based on the results from this Phase 12 trial we plan to obtain input from regulatory agencies on the requirements to submit for regulatory approval for commercialization in the United States and internationally  Regulatory Designations In October 2020 the FDA granted ODD and RPDD to PBKR03 for the treatment of Krabbe disease We believe these designations represent an important recognition of the dire need for an effective treatment option for those suffering from Krabbe The ODD grants us financial incentives to support clinical development and the potential for up to seven years of market exclusivity in the United States upon regulatory approval while under the RPDD program a sponsor who receives approval for a drug or biologic for a rare pediatric disease may qualify for a priority review voucher that may be sold or transferred In February 2021 we received a positive opinion from the EMA for our orphan drug designation application for PBKR03 for the treatment of Krabbe disease Clinical Trial Approvals In February 2021 the FDA notified us that our IND for PBKR03 was cleared which allows us to proceed with our clinical trial We have manufactured the PBKR03 clinical supply to support clinical trial initiation in the United States Trigeminal Ganglia and Dorsal Root Ganglia Toxicity The primary finding of the NHP toxicology studies for each of PBGM01 PBFT02 and PBKR03 was TRG and DRG toxicity with consequent peripheral and spinal cord axonopathy These findings have been previously reported as an AAV platform risk based on NHP studies in which minimal to mild DRG toxicity was observed within 14 to 30 days after dosing without clinical manifestations Chronic studies examining DRG toxicity have revealed no increase in severity and no clinical manifestations at four to six months or up to four years after 49 Table of Contents administration Similarly no clinical manifestations were observed in any animals on detailed neurological examinations or daily observations in the PBGM01 and PBFT02 toxicology studies We believe the asymptomatic sensory neuron findings observed in NHPs treated with AAV vectors via the ICM route likely represent a universal DRG pathology in NHPs administered AAV gene therapy Published data have shown that the administration of AAV vectors to NHPs via the blood or CSF can lead to damage of dorsal root ganglia and their associated axons Similar findings were observed following IV administration of an engineered variant of AAV9 More recently a metaanalysis of 33 nonclinical studies in 256 NHPs evaluated the severity of DRG pathology for five different capsids five different promoters and 20 different transgenes including an AAV9 vector expressing antibodies 170 days after ICM administration while also comparing different ROAs doses time courses study conduct animal age and sex This metaanalysis showed that mostly minimal to moderate asymptomatic DRG pathology characterized by mononuclear cell infiltrates neuronal degeneration and secondary axonopathy of central and peripheral axons were observed for all capsids and promoters tested including 83 of NHPs administered AAV intrathecally and 32 of NHPs administered AAV intravenously DRG pathology was absent prior to 14 days post administration was similar from 15 months postinjection and was less severe after 6 months The transgene appeared to have the greatest impact on the severity of the sensory neuron pathology suggesting that transgene overexpression drives the early events leading to neuronal degeneration Higher AAV doses correlated with increased severity Younger NHPs infants and juveniles appeared to exhibit less severe pathology compared to adult NHPs Animal sex and vector purification method had no impact Sensory nerve conduction studies detected abnormalities in a minority of animals correlating with a greater severity of peripheral nerve axonopathy For most studies it was not possible to identify a noobservedadverseeffectlevel above the MED To date the NHP studies examining DRG toxicity have revealed no clinical manifestations at four to six months or up to four years after administration To better understand the clinical significance of these findings we plan to implement clinical monitoring in our GM1 FTD and Krabbe disease interventional trials consisting of both nerve conduction studies and neurological exams focused on sensory and peripheral nerve function The GTP has recently published data on certain technology regarding MicroRNAmediated inhibition of transgene expression reduces DRG toxicity by AAV vectors We plan to work with Penn to evaluate the appropriateness of incorporating this technology into our research programs but do not expect to incorporate this earlystage technology into our current lead clinical programs for GM1 FTD or Krabbe We have access to this technology as part of our collaboration with GTP whereby we have access to novel capsids toxicity reduction technologies and delivery and formulation improvements Research Programs We also have four programs in the discovery candidate selection or INDenabling stage PBML04 for MLD PBAL05 for ALS PBCM06 for CMT2A and an undisclosed program to treat an adult CNS indication MLD is a monogenic autosomal recessive sphingolipid storage disease caused by mutations in the gene encoding the lysosomal enzyme ARSA We have initiated INDenabling studies for PBML04 Patients with MLD display progressive leukodystrophy demyelination in the CNS and PNS neuronal cell death and subsequent loss of all motor and cognitive function resulting in premature death especially in patients with early disease onset PBAL05 is targeting ALS patients who have a gainoffunction mutation in the C9orf72 gene ALS is a motor neuron disease characterized by rapid degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons leading to progressive weakness and premature death Most cases of ALS are sporadic with an unknown etiology but there are also genetic forms of the disease inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion Mutations in the C9orf72 gene are the most common genetic defects implicated in ALS accounting for approximately 34 of familial ALS cases and approximately 5 of sporadic ALS cases Mitofusin 2  or MFN2 gene mutations are associated with CMT2A which is a neurological disorder that presents complex phenotypes including not only neuropathyrelated features but also systemic impairment of the CNS CMT2A is the most frequent axonal form of CMT accounting for approximately 20 of the diagnosed cases Clinically the classic form of CMT2A is characterized by physical weakness foot deformities difficulty in walking and areflexia We are coordinating with GTP in conducting discovery stage preclinical studies for these programs Beyond this portfolio through our research collaboration with GTP we also have the option to license programs for ten additional indications along with rights and 50 Table of Contents licenses to new gene therapy technologies developed by Penn such as novel capsids toxicity reduction technologies and delivery and formulation Manufacturing Gene therapy manufacturing is a critical factor in the successful development and commercialization of novel genetic medicines and to that end we have established a relationship with Catalent a contract development and manufacturing organization or CDMO for our initial manufacturing needs Our gene therapy manufacturing strategy utilizes a production platform approach with HEK293 mammalian cells as the substrate triple plasmid transient transfection and singleuse fixedbed iCellis bioreactor system for the manufacture of our AAV product candidates We are using a wellcharacterized production platform that has been used for both commercial and clinical AAV products and product candidates We believe our approach will enable rapid development control of product quality and regulatory compliance Catalent has extensive experience with the iCellis bioreactor platform and HEK293 transient transfection gene therapy manufacturing As part of our research collaboration with GTP we have access to broad and deep earlystage process science capabilities and experience to enable technology transfer of scalable processes to our CDMO and stateofthe art analytical capabilities for product quality testing and analytical characterization GTP currently provides us with the preclinical and toxicology researchgrade vector supplies while Catalent provides us with the cGMP AAV clinical supplies for our clinical trials following a technology transfer process from Penn to Catalent The production process for all three of our lead candidates has been scaled up to GMP standards at Catalents facility and clinical materials for all three lead product candidates have been or are being manufactured We have a collaboration agreement with Catalent or the Catalent Collaboration Agreement As part of the Catalent Collaboration Agreement we paid Catalent an upfront fee for the commissioning qualification validation and equipping of a clean room suite Subject to validation of the clean room suite which was completed in the fourth quarter of 2020 we will pay an annual fee for five years for the use of the clean room suite We initiated cGMP manufacturing in the dedicated suite giving us the ability to meet production requirements for our current lead product candidates through clinical studies and early commercialization We believe that our platform manufacturing approach along with the dedicated manufacturing capabilities and capacity provide a core strategic advantage and positions us to be a leading drug development company to address rare monogenic CNS disorders In April 2020 we entered into a development services and clinical supply agreement or the Manufacturing and Supply Agreement with Catalent to secure clinical scale manufacturing capacity for batches of active pharmaceutical ingredients for our gene therapy product candidates The Manufacturing and Supply Agreement provides for a term of five years which period may be extended once at our option for an additional five yearperiod In consideration for the use of the clean room suite in addition to our annual fee we have agreed to a minimum amount of purchase commitments for each year in the term subject to adjustments for inflation In December 2020 we entered into a lease to support chemistry manufacturing and controls laboratory operations for our gene therapy programs This new laboratory is slated to open in the second quarter of 2021 and will initially focus on stateoftheart analytical capabilities clinical assay development and validation biomarker assay validation and clinical product testing to support both viral vector manufacturing and clinical development We believe that our manufacturing capabilities provide us with the advantages of better control of drug development timelines improved control of vector supply for a portfolio of clinical assets and improved control of product quality through the improvements of the manufacturing platform We expect to establish our own manufacturing facility for longterm commercial market supply As the research and development pipeline advances and grows we intend to pursue internal manufacturing capacity build out as needed We also anticipate that we will continue to make significant investments to further optimize our manufacturing capabilities to produce highquality costeffective AAV vectors and we will continue to make investments in process and analytical sciences internally or with third parties to evaluate and develop manufacturing process improvements that may increase the productivity and efficiency of our manufacturing platform processes 51 Table of Contents Competition The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries including the genetic medicines field are characterized by rapidly changing technologies competition and a strong emphasis on intellectual property We are aware of several companies focused on developing gene therapies in various indications as well as several companies addressing methods for modifying genes and regulating gene expression We may also face competition from large and specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies academic research institutions government agencies and public and private research institutions with genetic medicine and other therapeutic approaches We consider our most direct competitors

and Lysogene SA has received MHRA and Research Ethics Committee approvals in the United Kingdom in January 2021 and received IND clearance from FDA in February 2021 to start a Phase 1 clinical trial for a gene therapy treatment for GM1 We consider our most direct competitors with respect to PBFT02 for the treatment of FTDGRN to be Alector Inc which is conducting a Phase 2 clinical trial for immuneneurology treatment for FTDGRN and Prevail Therapeutics Inc which was acquired by Eli Lilly and Company in January 2021 has initiated a Phase 12 clinical trial for a gene therapy treatment for FTDGRN Alkermes plc and Arkuda Therapeutics Inc are conducting preclinical research using small molecule approaches to treat FTDGRN patients Denali Therapeutics has a preclinical recombinant progranulin protein under evaluation in addition to their oral EIF2a modulator in a Phase 1 clinical trial We are also aware of other therapeutic approaches in preclinical development that may target FTDGRN patients Recently Forge Biologics announced that FDA granted IND clearance for a Krabbe gene therapy candidate that combines bone marrow transplant and gene therapy There is some evidence that human stem cell transplant is beneficial for presymptomatic infants with Krabbe disease There is some evidence that hematopoetic stem cell transplant is beneficial for presymptomatic infants with Krabbe disease and it has become standard of care in many sites in the US We are also aware of other therapeutic approaches in preclinical development and an ongoing natural history study being conducted by the Childrens Hospital of Pittsburgh and certain academic studies for Krabbe disease Many of our potential competitors alone or with their strategic partners have substantially greater financial technical and other resources than we do such as larger research and development clinical marketing and manufacturing organizations Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of competitors Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer more effective have fewer or less severe side effects are more convenient or are less expensive than any product candidates that we may develop Competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market if ever Additionally new or advanced technologies developed by our competitors may render our current or future product candidates uneconomical or obsolete and we may not be successful in marketing our product candidates against competitors License Agreement University of Pennsylvania In May 2020 we entered into an amended and restated research collaboration and licensing agreement or the Penn Agreement with The Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania or Penn for research and development collaborations and exclusive license rights to patents for certain products and technologies which superseded the sponsored research collaboration and licensing agreement we entered into with Penn in September 2018 Under the Penn Agreement Penn granted us an exclusive worldwide license with the right to sublicense under certain patent rights controlled by Penn i as of the effective date or ii arising out of the conduct of research funded by us in each case to develop and commercialize licensed products for specific rare monogenic central nervous system or CNS indications Penn also granted us a nonexclusive worldwide license with the right to sublicense in connection with the foregoing patent rights or a licensed product under certain Penn knowhow and materials 52 Table of Contents necessary or reasonably useful to develop and commercialize such licensed products The Penn license grant covers up to 17 specific rare monogenic CNS indications Programs for the indications must be selected by May 2025 In addition upon written notification by us and provided Penn has the right to do so the Penn license grant automatically includes i one or more additional indications that may be treatable by the same licensed product if such indications are in the rare monogenic CNS field and ii provided certain conditions are met one or more additional indications outside the rare monogenic CNS field for a specific licensed product As part of our collaboration with Penn we also agreed to fund certain research in the laboratory of Dr James Wilson or the Wilson Laboratory relating to preclinical development of selected product candidates with the goal of identifying and preclinically developing up to 17 product candidates for further clinical development and commercialization by us We are also obligated to pay 50 million per year to fund discovery research in the Wilson Laboratory through May 2025 Our initial collaboration was for five rare monogenic CNS indications with options for seven additional rare monogenic CNS indications Following the amendment in May 2020 and subsequent to our recent option exercise our collaboration includes seven active programs for rare monogenic CNS indications and we have the option until May 2025 to collaborate with Penn and the Wilson Laboratory on up to ten additional rare monogenic CNS indications in each case upon payment of an option fee in the low seven figures Further through May 2025 Penn has agreed to notify us of any new technologies discovered developed or engineered by the Wilson Laboratory as part of its discovery program such as novel capsids toxicity reduction technologies and delivery and formulation We may add intellectual property covering any such new technology to the Penn license grant for any given indication that is within the collaboration In addition Penn will notify us of any patented manufacturing methods developed by the Wilson Laboratory during the specified research term and we have the option to obtain a nonexclusive license under those patent rights controlled by Penn for our licensed products On an indicationbyindication basis Penn has agreed to ensure that the Wilson Laboratory will not collaborate with any commercial third party to develop another gene therapy product for the same indication during or for one year following its work for us on a given indication and licensed product Under the licensed Penn patent rights Penn retains the right to conduct and to authorize noncommercial third parties to conduct certain educational research clinical and patient care activities As consideration for the licensed rights we issued Penn 839130 shares of our common stock in 2018 We also paid Penn a onetime license issuance fee of 25 million and have agreed to pay Penn an annual license maintenance fee in the low six figures which annual fee is creditable against royalties following the first commercial sale of a licensed product In addition for each licensed product we are obligated to pay Penn up to 165 million in aggregate development milestone payments upon the achievement of specific development milestone events by such licensed product for a first indication and reduced milestone payments for the second and third indications We are also obligated to pay Penn on a licensed productbylicensed product basis up to 550 million in aggregate commercial milestone payments We have also agreed to pay Penn on a licensed productbylicensed product and countrybycountry basis during the royalty period tiered royalties subject to customary reductions in the midsingle digits on annual worldwide net sales of such licensed product On a licensed productbylicensed product and countrybycountry basis the royalty period is from the date of first commercial sale of such licensed product in a country until the latest of i the expiration of the last valid claim within the licensed patent rights covering such licensed product in the country in which such licensed product is made used or sold ii the expiration of the data exclusivity term conferred by the applicable regulatory authority in such country with respect to such licensed product and iii the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale of such licensed product in such country In addition we have agreed to pay Penn a percentage of sublicensing income ranging from the midsingle digits to low double digits for sublicenses of our rights under the Penn Agreement If we add a new program to the collaboration the foregoing milestone royalty and sublicensing income payments may be increased depending on when the program is added Under the Penn Agreement we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize at least one licensed product for each of the licensed indications for prophylactic diagnostic and therapeutic uses in humans We may satisfy this obligation by achieving for each 53 Table of Contents licensed product certain diligence events by a specified achievement date which dates may be extended under certain circumstances Pursuant to the agreement Penn will be responsible for preclinical development activities including all INDenabling nonclinical studies and research grade manufacturing and other collaborative activities set forth in the plan for the funded research and we will be responsible for regulatory strategy and operations clinical development GMP manufacture and commercialization of all licensed products The agreement will expire on a licensed productbylicensed product and countrybycountry basis upon the later of i the expiration of the last valid claim of the licensed patent rights that covers the exploitation of such licensed product in such country and ii the expiration of the royalty period At any time after May 2025 we may terminate the agreement in its entirety or for a licensed product for convenience upon 90 days prior written notice to Penn Penn may terminate the agreement on an indicationbyindication basis if we fail to meet any diligence event and fail to timely cure such breach or the agreement in its entirety if we fail to pay the research funding fail to comply with applicable laws grant a security interest in any of the licensed patent rights fail to achieve certain financing obligations or make certain challenges to the licensed patent rights Either party may terminate the agreement for the other partys insolvency or material breach that is not cured within a specified period of time Intellectual Property Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary andor intellectual property protection in the United States and other countries for our current product candidates and future products as well as our core technologies including our manufacturing knowhow We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology inventions and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business by seeking maintaining and defending our intellectual property whether developed internally or licensed from third parties We also rely on trade secrets knowhow continuing technological innovation and inlicensing opportunities to develop strengthen and maintain our proprietary position in the field of gene therapy Additionally we intend to rely on regulatory protection afforded through rare drug designations data exclusivity and market exclusivity as well as patent term extensions where available Currently our patent protection consists of patent applications that we have inlicensed from Penn under the Penn Agreement for our product candidates in our licensed indications The inlicensed patent applications are directed to new AAV capsids and certain defined variants to recombinant AAV viruses or rAAVs capable of delivering certain genes into human cells to treat monogenic diseases of the CNS to methods of treating those monogenic diseases with rAAV as well as certain aspects of our manufacturing capabilities and related technologies Our inlicensed patent portfolio currently includes  a patent family with applications pending in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions with claims directed to rAAVs having an AAVhu68 capsid We exclusively licensed the patent family for licensed products within our rare monogenic field of use indications Any patents that may issue from applications in this family are expected to expire on February 27 2038 absent any term adjustments or extensions   two patent families with claims directed to an rAAV containing a coding sequence of human galactosidase for use in treating GM1 The first patent family includes a pending application in Argentina and a pending Patent Cooperation Treaty or PCT application Based on the PCT filing national and regional patent applications may be filed in the United States and over 150 foreign jurisdictions Any patents that may issue from applications in this family are expected to expire on September 30 2039 absent any term adjustments or extensions The second patent family includes three pending unpublished US provisional patent applications Any patents that may issue from applications in this family are expected to expire in February 2041   two patent families with claims directed to rAAV for use in treating Krabbe The first patent family includes a pending PCT application and pending applications in Argentina and Taiwan Any patents that may issue from applications in this family are expected to expire on February 26 2040 absent any term adjustments or extensions The second patent family includes two pending unpublished US provisional 54 Table of Contents patent applications Any patents that may issue from applications in this family are expected to expire in May 2041  two patent families with claims directed to rAAV for use in treating FTD The first patent family includes a pending PCT application and applications pending in Argentina and Taiwan Any patents that may issue from applications in this family are expected to expire on February 21 2040 absent any term adjustments or extensions The second patent family includes one pending unpublished US provisional patent application Any patents that may issue from applications in this family are expected to expire in August 2041  a patent family with claims directed to rAAV for use in treating MLD The patent family includes a pending PCT application and applications pending in Argentina and Taiwan Any patents that may issue from applications in this family are expected to expire in May 2040 absent any term adjustments or extensions  We also have options under the Penn Agreement to add additional intellectual property to our existing license as described in the section License Agreement To date we have exercised an option with respect to CharcotMarie Tooth disease or CMT At present there is one patent family directed to this newly licensed indication  a patent family with a pending unpublished US provisional patent application directed to rAAV for use in treating CMT Any patents that may issue from applications in this family are expected to expire in July 2041 absent any term adjustments and extensions The term of individual patents may vary based on the countries in which they are obtained Generally patents issued from applications filed in the United States are effective for 20 years from the earliest effective nonprovisional filing date In addition in certain instances a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of FDA regulatory review period The restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term including the restoration period must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval The duration of patents outside of the United States varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective national filing date In addition to patents and patent applications that we license we rely on trade secrets and knowhow to develop and maintain our competitive position For example significant aspects of our AAV manufacturing capabilities and gene therapy technology are based upon trade secrets and knowhow However trade secrets can be difficult to protect We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes and obtain and maintain control andor ownership of certain technologies in part through confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees consultants scientific advisors contractors and commercial partners We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data trade secrets and knowhow including by implementing measures intended to maintain the physical security of our premises and the physical and electronic security of our information technology systems Our ability to stop third parties from making using selling offering to sell or importing our products may depend on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that cover these activities With respect to our licensed intellectual property we cannot be sure that patents will issue with respect to any of the pending patent applications to which we license rights or with respect to any patent applications that we or our licensors may file in the future nor can we be sure that any of our licensed patents or any patents that may be issued in the future to us or our licensors will be commercially useful in protecting our product candidates and methods of manufacturing the same Moreover we may be unable to obtain patent protection for certain of our product candidates generally as well as with respect to certain indications See the section entitled Risk FactorsRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property for a more comprehensive description of risks related to our intellectual property Government Regulation and Product Approval Government authorities in the United States at the federal state and local level and in other countries and jurisdictions extensively regulate among other things the research development testing manufacture quality 55 Table of Contents control approval packaging storage recordkeeping labeling advertising promotion distribution marketing postapproval monitoring and reporting and import and export of pharmaceutical products The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources FDA Approval Process In the United States pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA The Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act or the FDC Act and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern among other things the research development testing manufacture storage recordkeeping approval labeling promotion and marketing distribution postapproval monitoring and reporting sampling and import and export of pharmaceutical products Biological products used for the prevention treatment or cure of a disease or condition of a human being are subject to regulation under the FDC Act except the section of the FDC Act which governs the approval of New Drug Applications or NDAs Biological products such as gene therapy products are approved for marketing under provisions of the Public Health Service Act or PHSA via a Biologics License Application or BLA However the application process and requirements for approval of BLAs are very similar to those for NDAs Failure to comply with applicable US requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions such as clinical hold FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs or BLAs warning or untitled letters product recalls product seizures total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions fines civil penalties and criminal prosecution Biological product development for a new product or certain changes to an approved product in the United States typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests the submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before clinical testing may commence and adequate and wellcontrolled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought Satisfaction of FDA premarket approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type complexity and novelty of the product or disease Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry formulation and toxicity as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including Good Laboratory Practices The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information including information about product chemistry manufacturing and controls and a proposed clinical trial protocol Longterm preclinical tests such as tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity in animals may continue after the IND is submitted A 30day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30day period the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational biologic to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator Clinical trials must be conducted i in compliance with federal regulations ii in compliance with Good Clinical Practice or GCP an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors administrators and monitors as well as iii under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated Each protocol involving testing on US patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA regulations or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients The trial protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board or IRB for approval An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted either temporarily or permanently for failure to comply with the IRBs requirements or may impose other conditions if it believes that the patients are subject to unacceptable risk 56 Table of Contents Clinical trials to support BLAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases but the phases may overlap In Phase 1 the initial introduction of the biologic into patients the product is tested to assess safety dosage tolerance metabolism pharmacokinetics pharmacological actions side effects associated with drug exposure and to obtain early evidence of a treatment effect if possible Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug or biologic for a particular indication determine optimal dose and regimen and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain additional information about clinical effects and confirm efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefitrisk relationship of the drug or biologic and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product In most cases the FDA requires two adequate and wellcontrolled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the drug or biologic In rare instances including instances of gene therapies intended for rare diseases a single Phase 3 trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient where there is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible In addition the manufacturer of an investigational drug in a Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical trial for a serious or lifethreatening disease is required to make available such as by posting on its website its policy on evaluating and responding to requests for expanded access to such investigational drug After completion of the required clinical testing a BLA is prepared and submitted to the FDA FDA approval of the BLA is required before marketing and distribution of the product may begin in the United States The BLA must include the results of all preclinical clinical and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the products pharmacology chemistry manufacture and controls The cost of preparing and submitting a BLA is substantial The submission of most BLAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee Under an approved BLA the applicant is also subject to an annual program fee These fees typically increase annually A BLA for a drug that has been designated as an orphan drug is not subject to an application fee unless the BLA includes an indication for other than a rare disease or condition The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of a BLA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the Agencys determination that it is adequately organized and sufficiently complete to permit substantive review Once the submission is accepted for filing the FDA begins an indepth review The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals to complete the review of BLAs Most applications are classified as Standard Review products that are reviewed within ten months of the date the FDA accepts the BLA for filing applications classified as Priority Review are reviewed within six months of the date the FDA accepts the BLA for filing A BLA can be classified for Priority Review when the FDA determines the biologic product has the potential to treat a serious or lifethreatening condition and if approved would be a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness compared to available therapies The review process for both standard and priority reviews may be extended by the FDA for three or more additional months to consider certain latesubmitted information or information intended to clarify information already provided in the BLA submission The FDA may also refer applications for novel biologic products or biologic products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to be reviewed by an advisory committeetypically a panel that includes clinicians statisticians and other expertsfor review evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the BLA should be approved The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee but generally follows such recommendations Before approving a BLA the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP Additionally the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the biologic product is manufactured The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with cGMP is satisfactory and the BLA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the biologic is safe pure potent and effective in the claimed indication After the FDA evaluates the BLA and completes any clinical and manufacturing site inspections it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the BLA submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application for approval If or when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDAs 57 Table of Contents satisfaction in a resubmission of the BLA the FDA will issue an approval letter The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing and distribution of the biologic with specific prescribing information for specific indications As a condition of BLA approval the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy or REMS to help ensure that the benefits of the biologic outweigh the potential risks to patients A REMS can include medication guides communication plans for healthcare professionals and elements to assure a products safe use or ETASU An ETASU can include but is not limited to special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing the product dispensing the product only under certain circumstances special monitoring and the use of patientspecific registries The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product Moreover the FDA may require substantial postapproval testing and surveillance to monitor the products safety or efficacy Once granted product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved BLA including changes in indications product labeling manufacturing processes or facilities require submission and FDA approval of a new BLA or BLA supplement before the change can be implemented A BLA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing BLA supplements as it does in reviewing BLAs Additional Standard for Gene Therapy Products In addition to the regulations discussed above there are a number of additional standards that apply to clinical trials involving the use of gene therapy FDA has issued various guidance documents regarding gene therapies which outline additional factors that FDA will consider at each of the above stages of development and relate to among other things the proper preclinical assessment of gene therapies the CMC information that should be included in an IND application the proper design of tests to measure product potency in support of an IND or BLA application and measures to observe delayed adverse effects in subjects who have been exposed to investigational gene therapies when the risk of such effects is high For instance FDA usually recommends that sponsors observe all surviving subjects who receive treatment using gene therapies that are based on adenoassociated virus vectors in clinical trials for potential gene therapyrelated delayed adverse events for a minimum 5year period followed by 10 years of annual queries either in person or by questionnaire FDA does not require the longterm tracking to be complete prior to its review of the BLA Orphan Drug Designation Under the Orphan Drug Act the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to biological products intended to treat a rare disease or conditiongenerally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200000 individuals in the United States or if it affects more than 200000 individuals in the United States there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a product available in the United States for such disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA After the FDA grants orphan drug designation the identity of the biological product and its potential orphan disease use are disclosed publicly by the FDA Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process The first BLA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active moiety to treat a particular disease with FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a sevenyear exclusive marketing period in the United States for that product in the approved indication For large molecule drugs including gene therapies sameness is determined based on the principal molecular structural features of a product As applied to gene therapies the FDA has recently issued draft guidance in which it stated it would consider certain key features such as the transgenes expressed by the gene therapy and the vectors used to deliver the transgene to be principal molecular structural features With regard to vectors the FDA intends to consider whether two vectors from the same viral class are the same or different on a casebycase basis The FDA does not intend to consider minor differences between transgenes and vectors to be different principal molecular structural features The FDA also intends to consider whether additional features of the final gene therapy product such as regulatory elements and the cell type that is transduced for genetically modified cells should also be considered to be principal molecular structural features During the sevenyear marketing exclusivity period the FDA may not approve any other applications to market a biological product containing the same principal molecular structural features for the same indication 58 Table of Contents except in limited circumstances such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity A product can be considered clinically superior if it is safer more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biological product for the same disease or condition or the same biological product for a different disease or condition Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA user fee Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher Program Under the Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher program FDA may award a priority review voucher to the sponsor of an approved marketing application for a product that treats or prevents a rare pediatric disease The voucher entitles the sponsor to priority review of one subsequent marketing application A voucher may be awarded only for an approved rare pediatric disease product application A rare pediatric disease product application is an NDA or BLA for a product that treats or prevents a serious or lifethreatening disease in which the serious or lifethreatening manifestations primarily affect individuals aged from birth to 18 years in general the disease must affect fewer than 200000 such individuals in the US the NDA or BLA must be deemed eligible for priority review the NDA or BLA must not seek approval for a different adult indication ie for a different diseasecondition the product must not contain an active ingredient that has been previously approved by FDA and the NDA or BLA must rely on clinical data derived from studies examining a pediatric population such that the approved product can be adequately labeled for the pediatric population Before NDA or BLA approval FDA may designate a product in development as a product for a rare pediatric disease To receive a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher a sponsor must notify FDA upon submission of the NDA or BLA of its intent to request a voucher If FDA determines that the NDA or BLA is a rare pediatric disease product application and if the NDA or BLA is approved FDA will award the sponsor of the NDA or BLA a voucher upon approval of the NDA or BLA FDA may revoke a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher if the product for which it was awarded is not marketed in the US within 365 days of the products approval The voucher which is transferable to another sponsor may be submitted with a subsequent NDA or BLA and entitles the holder to priority review of the accompanying NDA or BLA The sponsor submitting the priority review voucher must notify FDA of its intent to submit the voucher with the NDA or BLA at least 90 days prior to submission of the NDA or BLA and must pay a priority review user fee in addition to any other required user fee FDA must take action on an NDA or BLA under priority review within six months of receipt of the NDA or BLA On December 27 2020 the Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher program was reauthorized as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act 2021 allowing a product that is designated as a product for a rare pediatric disease prior to September 30 2024 to be eligible to receive a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher upon approval of a qualifying NDA or BLA prior to September 30 2026 It is unclear whether this program will continue to be reauthorized beyond the current sunset date in September 2024 Fast Track Designation and Priority Review FDA is required to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of a serious or lifethreatening disease or condition for which there is no effective treatment and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition Fast track designation may be granted for products that are intended to treat a serious or lifethreatening disease or condition for which there is no effective treatment and preclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition Fast track designation applies to both the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied Any product submitted to FDA for marketing including under a fast track program may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review such as priority review Priority review may be granted for products that are intended to treat a serious or lifethreatening condition and if approved would provide a significant improvement in safety and effectiveness compared to available therapies FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review Breakthrough Therapy Designation 59 Table of Contents The FDA is also required to expedite the development and review of biological products that are intended to treat a serious or lifethreatening disease or condition where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the biologic product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints The sponsor of a new biologic product candidate may request that the FDA designate the candidate for a specific indication as a Breakthrough Therapy concurrent with or after the filing of the IND for the biologic product candidate The FDA must determine if the biological product qualifies for Breakthrough Therapy designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsors request Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy RMAT Designation The RMAT designation is an expedited program for the advancement and approval of regenerative medicine therapies that are intended to treat modify reverse or cure a serious condition and where preliminary clinical evidence indicates the potential to address unmet medical needs for lifethreatening diseases or conditions Similar to Breakthrough Therapy designation the RMAT allows companies developing regenerative medicine therapies to work earlier more closely and frequently with the FDA and RMATdesignated products may be eligible for priority review and accelerated approval Regenerative medicine therapies include cell therapies therapeutic tissue engineering products human cell and tissue products and combination products using any such therapies or products except for those regulated solely under section 361 of the PHS Act and Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 1271 The FDA confirmed that gene therapies including genetically modified cells that lead to a sustained effect on cells or tissues may meet the definition of a regenerative medicine therapy For product candidates that have received a RMAT designation interaction and communication between the FDA and the sponsor of the trial can help to identify the most efficient path for clinical development while minimizing the number of patients placed in ineffective control regimens The timing of a sponsors request for designation and FDA response are the same as for the Breakthrough Therapy designation program Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information Sponsors of clinical trials of FDAregulated products including biological products are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information on the website wwwclinicaltrialsgov Information related to the product patient population phase of investigation trial sites and investigators and other aspects of a clinical trial are then made public as part of the registration Sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of their clinical trials after completion Disclosure of the results of clinical trials can be delayed in certain circumstances for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of clinical development programs as well as clinical trial design Pediatric Information Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act or PREA NDAs or BLAs or supplements to NDAs or BLAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biological product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the biological product is safe and effective The FDA may grant full or partial waivers or deferrals for submission of data Unless otherwise required by regulation PREA does not apply to any biological product with orphan product designation except a product with a new active ingredient that is a molecularly targeted cancer product intended for the treatment of an adult cancer and directed at a molecular target determined by FDA to be substantially relevant to the growth or progression of a pediatric cancer that is subject to an NDA or BLA submitted on or after August 18 2020 Additional Controls for Biologics To help reduce the increased risk of the introduction of adventitious agents the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing controls for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined The PHSA also provides authority to the FDA to immediately suspend biologics licenses in situations where there exists a danger to public health to prepare or procure products in the event of shortages and critical public health needs and to authorize the creation and enforcement of regulations to prevent the introduction or spread of communicable diseases within the United States 60 Table of Contents After a BLA is approved the product may also be subject to official lot release as a condition of approval As part of the manufacturing process the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution If the product is subject to official release by the FDA the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the lot manufacturing history and the results of all of the manufacturers tests performed on the lot The FDA may also perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products such as viral vaccines before allowing the manufacturer to release the lots for distribution In addition the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety purity potency and effectiveness of biological products As with drugs after approval of a BLA biologics manufacturers must address any safety issues that arise are subject to recalls or a halt in manufacturing and are subject to periodic inspection after approval Biosimilars The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 or BPCIA creates an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be highly similar to or interchangeable with an FDAlicensed reference biological product Biosimilarity sufficient to reference a prior FDAapproved product requires that there be no differences in conditions of use route of administration dosage form and strength and no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety purity and potency Biosimilarity must be shown through analytical trials animal trials and a clinical trial or trials unless the Secretary of Health and Human Services waives a required element A biosimilar product may be deemed interchangeable with a previously approved product if it meets the higher hurdle of demonstrating that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and for products administered multiple times the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic To date a handful of biosimilar products and no interchangeable products have been approved under the BPCIA Complexities associated with the larger and often more complex structures of biological products as well as the process by which such products are manufactured pose significant hurdles to biosimilar product implementation which is still being evaluated by the FDA A reference biologic is granted 12 years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure or BLA approval of the reference product and no application for a biosimilar can be submitted for four years from the date of licensure of the reference product The first biologic product submitted under the biosimilar abbreviated approval pathway that is determined to be interchangeable with the reference product has exclusivity against a finding of interchangeability for other biologics for the same condition of use for the lesser of i one year after first commercial marketing of the first interchangeable biosimilar ii 18 months after the first interchangeable biosimilar is approved if there is no patent challenge iii eighteen months after resolution of a lawsuit over the patents of the reference biologic in favor of the first interchangeable biosimilar applicant or iv 42 months after the first interchangeable biosimilars application has been approved if a patent lawsuit is ongoing within the 42month period PostApproval Requirements Once a BLA is approved a product will be subject to certain postapproval requirements For instance the FDA closely regulates the postapproval marketing and promotion of biologics including standards and regulations for directtoconsumer advertising offlabel promotion industrysponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet Biologics may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic safety summary reports is required following FDA approval of a BLA The FDA also may require postmarketing testing known as Phase 4 testing REMS and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product In addition quality control biological product manufacture packaging and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval Biologic manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA during which the agency inspects a biologic products manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs Accordingly 61 Table of Contents manufacturers must continue to expend time money and effort in the areas of production and qualitycontrol to maintain compliance with cGMPs Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with required regulatory standards if it encounters problems following initial marketing or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered Other US Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements In the United States biotechnology company activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal state and local authorities in addition to the FDA including but not limited to the Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services or CMS other divisions of the US Department of Health and Human Services eg the Office of Inspector General and the Office for Civil Rights the US Department of Justice or DOJ and individual US Attorney offices within the DOJ and state and local governments For example sales marketing and scientific  educational grant programs may have to comply with the antifraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act the federal false claims laws the privacy and security provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act or HIPAA and similar state laws each as amended as applicable The federal AntiKickback Statute prohibits among other things any person or entity from knowingly and willfully offering paying soliciting or receiving any remuneration directly or indirectly overtly or covertly in cash or in kind to induce or in return for purchasing leasing ordering recommending or arranging for the purchase lease or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value The Anti Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers purchasers andor formulary managers on the other There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution The exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the AntiKickback Statute Instead the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a casebycase basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances Practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for protection under a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor In addition the statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors are subject to change Additionally the intent standard under the AntiKickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 or collectively the ACA to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation In addition the ACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal AntiKickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act discussed below The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity who among other things is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent Federal false claims laws including the federal civil False Claims Act prohibit among other things any person or entity from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented a false claim for payment to or approval by the federal government or knowingly making using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009 a claim includes any request or demand for money or property presented to the US government In addition manufacturers can be held liable under the civil False Claims Act even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to cause the submission of false or fraudulent claims Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for among other things allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies marketing of the product for unapproved and thus generally nonreimbursable uses and purportedly concealing price concessions in the pricing information submitted to the government for government price reporting purposes 62 Table of Contents HIPAA created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud or to obtain by means of false or fraudulent pretenses representations or promises any money or property owned by or under the control or custody of any healthcare benefit program including private thirdparty payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying concealing or covering up by trick scheme or device a material fact or making any materially false fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits items or services Similar to the AntiKickback Statute a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation Also many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs or in several states apply regardless of the payor Data privacy and security regulations by both the federal government and the states in which business is conducted may also be applicable HIPAA as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act or HITECH and its implementing regulations imposes requirements relating to the privacy security and transmission of individually identifiable health information HIPAA requires covered entities to limit the use and disclosure of protected health information to specifically authorized situations and requires covered entities to implement security measures to protect health information that they maintain in electronic form Among other things HITECH made HIPAAs security standards directly applicable to business associates independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions In addition state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect thus complicating compliance efforts Additionally the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act within the ACA and its implementing regulations require that certain manufacturers of drugs devices biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare Medicaid or the Childrens Health Insurance Program with certain exceptions report annually to CMS information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians defined to include doctors dentists optometrists podiatrists and chiropractors and teaching hospitals or to entities or individuals at the request of or designated on behalf of the physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members Beginning in 2022 applicable manufacturers also will be required to report such information regarding its relationships with physician assistants nurse practitioners clinical nurse specialists certified registered nurse anesthetists anesthesiologist assistants and certified nurse midwives during the previous year Commercial distribution of products requires compliance with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of drug and biological products in a state including in certain states manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain In addition several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to establish marketing compliance programs file periodic reports with the state make periodic public disclosures on sales marketing pricing clinical trials and other activities andor register their sales representatives as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for use in sales and marketing and to prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices Certain local jurisdictions also require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures Sales and marketing activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws 63 Table of Contents Violation of any of the federal and state healthcare laws described above or any other governmental regulations may result in penalties including without limitation significant civil criminal andor administrative penalties damages fines disgorgement exclusion from participation in government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid imprisonment injunctions private qui tam actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government refusal to enter into government contracts oversight monitoring contractual damages reputational harm administrative burdens diminished profits and future earnings Coverage Pricing and Reimbursement Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which regulatory approval is obtained In the United States and markets in other countries sales of any products for which regulatory approval is received for commercial sale will depend in part on the extent to which thirdparty payors provide coverage and establish adequate reimbursement levels for such products In the United States thirdparty payors include federal and state healthcare programs private managed care providers health insurers and other organizations The process for determining whether a thirdparty payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the product Thirdparty payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list also known as a formulary which might not include all of the FDAapproved products for a particular indication Thirdparty payors are increasingly challenging the price examining the medical necessity and reviewing the costeffectiveness of medical products therapies and services in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy Expensive pharmacoeconomic studies may need to be conducted in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and costeffectiveness of product candidates in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals Product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or costeffective A payors decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved Further one payors determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product Adequate thirdparty reimbursement may not be available to enable the maintenance of price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on investment in product development Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries In the EU governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the costeffectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines but monitor and control company profits The downward pressure on health care costs has become very intense As a result increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products In addition in some countries crossborder imports from lowpriced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country The marketability of any product candidates for which regulatory approval is received for commercial sale may suffer if the government and other thirdparty payors fail to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement In addition emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and is expected to continue to increase the pressure on healthcare pricing Coverage policies and thirdparty reimbursement rates may change at any time Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which regulatory approval is received less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future Healthcare Reform In March 2010 President Obama enacted the ACA which has begun to substantially change healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers and has also begun to significantly impact the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry The ACA will impact existing government healthcare programs and will result in the development of new programs Among the ACA provisions of importance to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries in addition to those otherwise described above are the following 64 Table of Contents  an annual nondeductible fee on any entity that manufacturers or imports certain specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents apportioned among these entities according to their market share in some government healthcare programs that began in 2011   an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program retroactive to January 1 2010 to 231 and 13 of the Average Manufacturer Price or AMP for most branded and generic drugs respectively and capped the total rebate amount for innovator drugs at 100 of the AMP   a Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program in which manufacturers must now agree to offer 70 pointofsale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period as a condition for the manufacturers outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D  extension of manufacturers Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations   expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by among other things allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals beginning in 2014 and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for individuals with income at or below 133 of the federal poverty level thereby potentially increasing manufacturers Medicaid rebate liability   expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program and   a new PatientCentered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research along with funding for such research There remain judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA as well as efforts by the Trump administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the ACA Since January 2017 President Trump has signed several Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA Concurrently Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation it has enacted laws that modify certain provisions of the ACA such as removing penalties effective January 1 2019 for not complying with the ACAs individual mandate to carry health insurance and eliminating the implementation of certain ACAmandated fees and increasing the pointofsale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D On December 14 2018 a Texas US District Court Judge ruled that the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the individual mandate was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 On December 18 2019 the US Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the District Court ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the Affordable Care Act are invalid as well On November 10 2020 the United States Supreme Court heard oral arguments but it is unclear when a decision will be made There has been heightened governmental scrutiny in the United States of pharmaceutical pricing practices in light of the rising cost of prescription drugs and biologics Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to among other things bring more transparency to product pricing review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products For example on July 24 2020 and September 13 2020 President Trump announced several executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that seek to implement several of the administrations proposals As a result the FDA also released a final rule on September 24 2020 providing guidance for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada Further on November 20 2020 the US Department of Health and Human Services or HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers unless the price reduction is required by law The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the pointofsale as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers HHS 65 Table of Contents also published an interim final rule that establishes a Most Favored Nation or MFN Model for Medicare Part B drug payment This regulation would substantially change the drug reimbursement landscape as it bases Medicare Part B payment for 50 selected drugs on prices in foreign countries instead of average sales price or ASP The MFN drug payment amount is expected to be lower than the current ASPbased payment limit because US drug prices are generally the highest in the world Although the MFN Model payment methodology was scheduled to begin on January 1 2021 it faces uncertain prospects for implementation By the end of December 2020 three federal courts had granted orders preventing implementation of the rule In addition to these lawsuits the change in administration or additional litigation challenging the regulation could delay or halt its implementation The likelihood of implementation of any of these and the other Trump administration reform initiatives is uncertain particularly in light of the recent change in administration on January 20 2021 At the state level legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing including price or patient reimbursement constraints discounts restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures and in some cases designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare and other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent the generation revenue attainment profitability or commercialization of products We cannot predict what healthcare reform initiatives may be adopted in the future particularly in light of the recent presidential election However it is possible that there will be further legislation or regulation that could harm the business financial condition and results of operations Further it is possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the COVID19 pandemic Employees and Human Capital Resources As of December 31 2020 we had 74 fulltime employees From time to time we also retain independent contractors to support our organization Of these employees 20 held PhD PharmD or MD degrees and 43 were engaged in research development and technical operations All of our employees are based in the United States None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by collective bargaining agreements and we believe our relationship with our employees is good Our human capital resources objectives include as applicable identifying recruiting retaining incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract retain and motivate selected employees consultants and directors through the granting of stockbased compensation awards and cashbased performance bonus awards Facilities Our principal executive office is located in Philadelphia Pennsylvania where we lease a total of 8887 square feet of office and laboratory space that we use for our administrative research and development and other activities In April 2020 we entered into a lease agreement for new principal executive offices which we expect to commence in March 2021 and amended our existing lease to terminate upon commencement of the new lease The new premises will include approximately 37000 square feet in Philadelphia Pennsylvania The new lease is expected to expire in January 2031 subject to our option to extend the new lease by up to two additional fiveyear terms We also lease approximately 62000 square feet of laboratory space at the Princeton West Innovation Campus in Hopewell New Jersey This lease has a 15year term from the later of i March 15 2021 or ii the date the landlord delivers the property in sufficient delivery condition We have the option to extend the term of the lease by up to two additional fiveyear terms Legal Proceedings From time to time we may be involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business We are not presently a party to any legal proceedings that in the opinion of management would have a material adverse effect on our business Regardless of outcome litigation can have an adverse impact on us due to defense and settlement costs diversion of management resources negative publicity and reputational harm and other factors 66 Table of Contents Corporate Information We were incorporated

RISK FACTORS Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk Before making your decision to invest in shares of our common stock you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with the other information contained in this annual report including our financial statements and the related notes and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we currently believe are not material may also become important factors that affect us We cannot assure you that any of the events discussed below will not occur These events could have a material and adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects If that were to happen the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment Risks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital We are a clinical stage biotechnology company with a history of operating losses and we may not achieve or sustain profitability We anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future Our limited operating history may make it difficult for you to evaluate the success of our business to date and to assess our future viability We are a clinical stage genetic medicines company with a limited operating history on which to base your investment decision Biotechnology product development is a highly speculative undertaking and involves a substantial degree of risk Our operations to date have been limited primarily to organizing and staffing our company business planning raising capital and entering into collaboration and vendor agreements for conducting preclinical research and development activities for our product candidates All of our lead product candidates are still in clinical development or the preclinical testing stage We have no products approved for commercial sale and have not generated any revenue from commercial product sales and we will continue to incur significant research and development and other expenses related to our clinical development and ongoing operations We have funded our operations to date through proceeds from sales of our convertible preferred stock and public offerings and do not expect to receive revenue for many years if ever We have incurred net losses since our inception in 2017 We incurred net losses of 1122 million and 456 million for the years ended December 31 2020 and 2019 respectively As of December 31 2020 we had an accumulated deficit of 1709 million Substantially all of our operating losses have resulted from costs incurred in connection with our research and development programs and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses over the next several years and for the foreseeable future as we intend to continue to conduct research and development clinical testing regulatory compliance activities manufacturing activities and if any of our product candidates is approved sales and marketing activities that together with anticipated general and administrative expenses will likely result in us incurring significant losses for the foreseeable future Our prior losses combined with expected future losses have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders deficit and working capital We expect that it will be several years if ever before we have a commercialized product We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially if and as we  continue to advance the preclinical and clinical development of our existing product candidates and discovery stage programs  seek regulatory approvals for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials  hire additional clinical quality control regulatory manufacturing scientific and administrative personnel  expand our operational financial and management systems and increase personnel including personnel to support our clinical development manufacturing and commercialization efforts and our operations as a public company  maintain expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio and 68 Table of Contents  incur additional legal accounting or other expenses in operating our business including the additional costs associated with operating as a public company In addition as a new business we may encounter unforeseen expenses difficulties complications delays and other known and unknown factors We are in the process of transitioning rapidly from a small startup company with a focus on hiring employees establishing key collaborations and financing to a more fullyintegrated company that is capable of supporting clinical development manufacturing and commercial activities We may not be successful in such a transition We have never generated revenue from product sales and may never achieve or maintain profitability We have no products approved for commercial sale and have not generated any revenue from commercial product sales To become and remain profitable we must develop and eventually commercialize product candidates with significant market potential which will require us to be successful in a range of challenging activities These activities can include completing preclinical studies and initiating and completing clinical trials of our product candidates obtaining marketing approval for these product candidates manufacturing marketing and selling those products that are approved and satisfying any post marketing requirements We may never succeed in any or all of these activities and even if we do we may never generate revenues that are significant or large enough to achieve profitability Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical product development we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when or if we will be able to achieve profitability Even if we do achieve profitability we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis Our failure to become and remain profitable would decrease the value of our company and could impair our ability to raise capital maintain our research and development efforts expand our business or continue our operations A decline in the value of our company also could cause you to lose all or part of your investment We will need to raise additional funding before we can expect to become profitable from any potential future sales of our products This additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all Failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed may force us to delay limit or terminate our product development efforts or other operations We will require substantial future capital in order to complete planned and future preclinical and clinical development for PBGM01 PBFT02 PBKR03 and any other product candidates if any and potentially commercialize these product candidates if approved We expect our spending levels to significantly increase in connection with our preclinical studies and planned clinical trials if any of our lead product candidates In addition if we obtain marketing approval for any of our product candidates we expect to incur significant expenses related to product sales medical affairs marketing manufacturing and distribution Furthermore we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company Accordingly we will need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on acceptable terms we would be forced to delay reduce or eliminate certain of our licensing activities our research and development programs or other operations Our operations have consumed significant amounts of cash since inception As of December 31 2020 our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were 3048 million We expect that the net proceeds of 1659 million from the public offering that closed in January 2021 together with our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31 2020 will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least 24 months as of the date of this filing However we have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong and our operating plan may change as a result of factors currently unknown to us As a result we could deplete our capital resources sooner than we currently expect Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including  the scope timing progress and results of discovery preclinical development laboratory testing and clinical trials for our product candidates 69 Table of Contents  the costs of manufacturing our product candidates for clinical trials and in preparation for marketing approval and commercialization  the extent to which we enter into collaborations or other arrangements with additional third parties in order to further develop our product candidates  the costs of preparing filing and prosecuting patent applications maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending intellectual propertyrelated claims  the costs and fees associated with the discovery acquisition or inlicense of additional product candidates or technologies  our ability to establish collaborations on favorable terms if at all  the costs required to scale up our clinical regulatory and manufacturing capabilities  the costs of future commercialization activities if any including establishing sales marketing manufacturing and distribution capabilities for any of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval and  revenue if any received from commercial sales of our product candidates should any of our product candidates receive marketing approval  Accordingly we will need to continue to rely on additional financing to achieve our business objectives which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all We may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans If adequate funds are not available to us on a timely basis or on terms acceptable to us we may be required to delay limit reduce or terminate preclinical studies clinical trials or other development activities for one or more product candidates or discovery stage programs or delay limit reduce or terminate our establishment of sales and marketing capabilities or other activities that may be necessary to commercialize any product candidates if approved Raising additional capital may cause dilution to our stockholders restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates Until such time if ever as we can generate substantial product revenues we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings debt financings collaborations strategic alliances and marketing distribution or licensing arrangements We do not have any committed external source of funds To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or securities convertible into equity your ownership interest will be diluted and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a common stockholder Debt financing and preferred equity financing if available may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions such as incurring additional debt selling or licensing our assets making capital expenditures or declaring dividends If we raise additional funds through collaborations strategic alliances or marketing distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies future revenue streams research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed or on terms acceptable to us we may be required to delay limit reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves Risks Related to Product Development and Regulatory Approval The outbreak of the novel strain of coronavirus SARSCoV2 which causes COVID19 could adversely impact our business including our preclinical development activities and planned clinical trials Public health crises such as pandemics or similar outbreaks could adversely impact our business In December 2019 a novel strain of coronavirus SARSCoV2 which causes COVID19 surfaced in Wuhan China Since then COVID19 has spread to multiple countries including the United States As a result of the COVID19 outbreak or 70 Table of Contents similar pandemics we may experience disruptions that could severely impact our business manufacturing preclinical development activities preclinical studies and planned clinical trials including  delays or difficulties in clinical site initiation for PBGM01 PBFT02 and PBKR03 including difficulties in obtaining IRB approvals recruiting clinical site investigators and clinical site staff  delays or difficulties in enrolling patients in clinical trials  interruption or delays in the operations of the US Food and Drug Administration or the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory agencies which may impact timelines for regulatory submission and review trial initiation and regulatory approval  interruption of planned key clinical trial activities such as clinical trial site data monitoring and patient recruitment due to limitations on travel imposed or recommended by federal or state governments employers and others or interruption of clinical trial subject visits and study procedures particularly any procedures that may be deemed nonessential which may impact the integrity of subject data and planned clinical study endpoints  delays or disruptions in preclinical development activities particularly at Penn including nonclinical experiments and investigational new drug applicationenabling good laboratory practice standard toxicology studies due to unforeseen circumstances in employee resources or supply chain  interruption or delays in our CROs and collaborators meeting expected deadlines or complying with regulatory requirements related to preclinical development activities preclinical studies and planned clinical trials  interruptions of or delays in receiving supplies of our product candidates from our CMOs particularly at Catalent due to staffing shortages productions slowdowns or stoppages and disruptions in delivery systems  increased rates of patients withdrawing from any planned clinical trials following enrollment as a result of contracting COVID19 or being forced to quarantine  diversion of healthcare resources away from the conduct of our preclinical development activities preclinical studies and planned clinical trials including the diversion of hospitals serving as any potential clinical trial sites and hospital staff supporting the conduct of our planned clinical trials  limitations on employee or collaborator resources that would otherwise be focused on the conduct of our preclinical development activities preclinical studies and planned clinical trials including because of sickness of employees or their families the desire of employees to avoid contact with large groups of people an increased reliance on working from home or mass transit disruptions and  reduced ability to engage with the medical and investor communities due to the cancellation of conferences scheduled throughout the year  These and other factors arising from the COVID19 pandemic could worsen in countries that are already afflicted with COVID19 could continue to spread to additional countries or could return to countries where the pandemic has been partially contained each of which could further adversely impact our ability to conduct preclinical development activities preclinical studies and planned clinical trials and our business generally and could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial condition and results In addition the trading prices for our common stock and other biopharmaceutical companies as well as the broader equity and debt markets have been highly volatile as a result of the COVID19 pandemic and the resulting impact on economic activity As a result we may face difficulties raising capital when needed and any such sales may be on unfavorable terms to us Further to the extent we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities the ownership interest of existing stockholders will be diluted The COVID19 outbreak continues to rapidly evolve The extent to which the outbreak may impact our business manufacturing preclinical development activities preclinical studies and planned clinical trials will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence Such developments include the ultimate geographic spread of COVID19 the duration of the outbreak travel restrictions and actions to contain the outbreak or treat its impact such as social distancing and quarantines or lockdowns in the United States and other 71 Table of Contents countries business closures or business disruptions and the effectiveness of actions taken in the United States and other countries to contain and treat the disease We are early in our development efforts Our business is dependent on our ability to advance our current and future product candidates through preclinical studies and clinical trials obtain marketing approval and ultimately commercialize them If we are unable or experience significant delays in doing so our business will be materially harmed We are early in our development efforts and our lead product candidates have only recently cleared their IND submissions Additionally we have a portfolio of programs that are in earlier stages of preclinical development and may never advance to clinicalstage development Our ability to generate product revenue which we do not expect will occur for many years if ever will depend heavily on the successful development and eventual commercialization of our product candidates which may never occur We currently generate no revenue from sales of any product and we may never be able to develop or commercialize a marketable product Each of our programs and product candidates will require additional preclinical andor clinical development regulatory approval in multiple jurisdictions obtaining manufacturing supply capacity and expertise building a commercial organization or successfully outsourcing commercialization substantial investment and significant marketing efforts before we generate any revenue from product sales Our product candidates must be authorized for marketing by the FDA or certain other exUS regulatory agencies before we may commercialize our product candidates The clinical and commercial success of our product candidates will depend on several factors including the following  timely and successful completion of preclinical studies including toxicology studies biodistribution studies biocompatibility studies and minimally efficacious dose studies in animals where applicable  effective INDs or comparable foreign applications that allow commencement of our planned clinical trials or future clinical trials for our product candidates  successful enrollment and completion of clinical trials including under the FDAs current Good Clinical Practices or cGCPs and current Good Laboratory Practices or cGLP  positive results from our future clinical programs that support a finding of safety and effectiveness and an acceptable riskbenefit profile of our product candidates in the intended populations  receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities  establishment of arrangements with thirdparty manufacturers or our own facilities for clinical supply and where applicable commercial manufacturing capabilities  establishment and maintenance of patent and trade secret protection or regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates  commercial launch of our product candidates if approved whether alone or in collaboration with others  acceptance of the benefits and use of our product candidates including method of administration if and when approved by patients the medical community and thirdparty payors  effective competition with other therapies  establishment and maintenance of healthcare coverage and adequate reimbursement and patients willingness to pay outofpocket in the absence of such coverage and adequate reimbursement  establishment of a physician training system and network for administration of our product candidates by injection into the ICM  enforcement and defense of intellectual property rights and claims and  maintenance of a continued acceptable safety tolerability and efficacy profile of our product candidates following approval  If we do not succeed in one or more of these factors in a timely manner or at all we could experience significant delays or an inability to successfully commercialize our product candidates which would materially harm our business If we are unable to advance our product candidates to clinical development obtain regulatory approval and ultimately commercialize our product candidates or experience significant delays in doing so our business will be materially harmed 72 Table of Contents Preclinical and clinical development involve a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome We may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing or ultimately be unable to complete the development and commercialization of our current product candidates or any future product candidates All of our product candidates are in clinical or preclinical development and their risk of failure is high We currently rely exclusively on GTP for our preclinical and INDenabling studies It is impossible to predict when or if any of our product candidates will receive regulatory approval To obtain the requisite regulatory approvals to commercialize any product candidates we must demonstrate through extensive preclinical studies and lengthy complex and expensive clinical trials that our product candidates are safe and effective in humans For example our IND for PBGM01 for the treatment of GM1 was initially placed on clinical hold Even though the FDA removed the clinical hold on the IND for PBGM01 other future product candidates may be subject to clinical holds in the future Clinical testing can take many years to complete and its outcome is inherently uncertain We will rely on CROs for the clinical development of our lead candidates Failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process The results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials or early cohorts of our clinical trials of our product candidates including early biomarker data may not be predictive of the results of laterstage clinical trials or later cohorts of our clinical trials Early clinical trials and in particular initial cohorts of early clinical trials often enroll significantly fewer patients than later stage clinical trials or later cohorts of the same clinical trial and may not be as predictive as larger trials We may be unable to establish clinical endpoints that applicable regulatory authorities would consider clinically meaningful or come to agreement on other aspects of clinical trial design Moreover a clinical trial can fail at any stage of testing Differences in trial design between earlystage clinical trials and laterstage clinical trials make it difficult to extrapolate the results of earlier clinical trials to later clinical trials Moreover clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses and many companies that have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval of their products A number of companies in the biotechnology industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or to unfavorable safety profiles notwithstanding promising results in earlier trials There is typically a high rate of failure of product candidates proceeding through clinical trials Most product candidates that commence clinical trials are never approved as products and there can be no assurance that any of our future clinical trials will ultimately be successful or support clinical development of our current or any of our future product candidates We or our collaborators may experience delays in initiating or completing clinical trials We or our collaborators also may experience numerous unforeseen events during or as a result of any future clinical trials that we could conduct that could delay or prevent our ability to receive marketing approval or commercialize our lead product candidates or any future product candidates including  regulators such as the FDA may place our clinical trials on clinical hold for example the FDA placed our trial of PGM101 for the treatment of GM1 on clinical hold from July 2020 to December 2020  institutional review boards or IRBs the FDA or ethics committees may not authorize us or our investigators to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site  we may experience delays in reaching or fail to reach agreement on acceptable terms with prospective trial sites and prospective contract research organizations or CROs the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites  clinical trial sites deviating from trial protocol or dropping out of a trial  novel therapies such as gene therapies with less wellcharacterized safety profiles may require slower or more staggered early clinical trial enrollment to adequately assess safety data  clinical trials of any product candidates may fail to show safety or efficacy produce negative or inconclusive results and we may decide or regulators may require us to conduct additional preclinical studies or clinical trials or we may decide to abandon product development programs  the number of subjects required for clinical trials of any product candidates may be larger than we anticipate enrollment in these clinical trials may be slower than we anticipate or subjects may drop out of these clinical trials or fail to return for posttreatment followup at a higher rate than we anticipate  our thirdparty contractors may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner or at all or may deviate from the clinical trial protocol or drop out of the trial which may require that we add new clinical trial sites or investigators 73 Table of Contents  we may elect to or regulators IRBs or ethics committees may require that we or our investigators suspend or terminate clinical research or trials for various reasons including noncompliance with regulatory requirements or a finding that the participants in our trials are being exposed to unacceptable health risks  the cost of clinical trials of any of our product candidates may be greater than we anticipate  the quality of our product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of our product candidates may be inadequate to initiate or complete a given clinical trial  our inability to manufacture sufficient quantities of our product candidates for use in clinical trials  reports from clinical testing of other therapies may raise safety or efficacy concerns about our product candidates  our failure to establish an appropriate safety profile for a product candidate based on clinical or preclinical data for such product candidate as well as data emerging from other molecules in the same class as our product candidate and  the FDA or exUS regulatory agencies may require us to submit additional data such as longterm toxicology studies or impose other requirements before permitting us to initiate a clinical trial  Patient enrollment a significant factor in the timing of clinical trials is affected by many factors including the size and nature of the patient population the number and location of clinical sites we enroll the proximity of patients to clinical sites the eligibility and exclusion criteria for the trial the design of the clinical trial the inability to obtain and maintain patient consents the risk that enrolled participants will drop out before completion competing clinical trials and clinicians and patients perceptions as to the potential advantages of the product candidate being studied in relation to other available therapies including any new drugs or therapeutic biologics that may be approved for the indications being investigated by us Furthermore we expect to rely on our collaborators CROs and clinical trial sites to ensure the proper and timely conduct of our future clinical trials including the patient enrollment process and we have limited influence over their performance Additionally we could encounter delays if treating physicians encounter unresolved ethical issues associated with enrolling patients in future clinical trials of our product candidates in lieu of prescribing existing treatments that have established safety and efficacy profiles We could also encounter delays if a clinical trial is suspended or terminated by us the IRBs of the institutions in which such trials are being conducted or the FDA or other regulatory authorities or if a clinical trial is recommended for suspension or termination by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee for such trial A suspension or termination may be imposed due to a number of factors including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial site by the FDA or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects failure to demonstrate a benefit from using a product or treatment failure to establish or achieve clinically meaningful trial endpoints changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions or lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial Clinical studies may also be delayed or terminated as a result of ambiguous or negative interim results Many of the factors that cause or lead to a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our product candidates Further the FDA or other regulatory authorities may disagree with our clinical trial design and our interpretation of data from clinical trials or may change the requirements for approval even after they have reviewed and commented on the design for our clinical trials Our product development costs will increase if we experience delays in clinical testing or marketing approvals We do not know whether any of our clinical trials will begin as planned will need to be restructured or will be completed on schedule or at all Significant clinical trial delays also could shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates and may allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do potentially impairing our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates and harming our business and results of operations Any delays in our clinical development programs may harm our business financial condition and results of operations significantly 74 Table of Contents We have not tested any of our product candidates in clinical trials Success in early preclinical studies or clinical trials may not be indicative of results obtained in later preclinical studies and clinical trials Conducting preclinical testing is a lengthy timeconsuming and expensive process The length of time of such testing may vary substantially according to the type complexity and novelty of the program and often can be several years or more per program Delays associated with programs for which we are conducting preclinical testing and studies may cause us to incur additional operating expenses Though gene therapy product candidates like ours have been evaluated by others in clinical trials our product candidates have never been evaluated in human clinical trials and we may experience unexpected or adverse results in the future We will be required to demonstrate through adequate and wellcontrolled clinical trials that our product candidates are safe and effective with a favorable benefitrisk profile for use in their target indications before we can seek regulatory approvals for their commercial sale Our initial clinical trials will begin with relatively small cohorts before expanding in size in subsequent cohorts If safety issues arise in an early cohort we may be delayed or prevented from subsequently expanding into larger trial cohorts Earlier gene therapy clinical trials conducted by others also utilized adenoassociated viral or AAV vectors However these studies should not be relied upon as evidence that our planned clinical trials will succeed Trial designs and results from previous trials are not necessarily predictive of our future clinical trial designs or results and initial positive results we may observe may not be confirmed upon full analysis of the complete trial data In addition the positive results we have observed for our product candidates in preclinical animal models may not be predictive of our future clinical trials in humans Our product candidates may also fail to show the desired safety and efficacy in later stages of clinical development even if they successfully advance through initial clinical trials Interim topline and preliminary data from our clinical trials that we or our partners announce or publish from time to time may change as more patient data become available and are subject to audit and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data From time to time we may make public interim topline or preliminary data from our clinical trials including preliminary biomarker data Interim data from clinical trials that we may complete are subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as patient enrollment continues and more patient data become available Preliminary or topline data also remain subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the preliminary or topline data that were previously made public As a result interim and preliminary data should be viewed with caution until the final data are available Adverse differences between interim or preliminary or topline data and final data could significantly harm our reputation and business prospects If we do not achieve our projected development goals in the time frames we announce and expect the commercialization of our products may be delayed From time to time we estimate the timing of the accomplishment of various scientific clinical regulatory manufacturing and other product development goals which we sometimes refer to as milestones These milestones may include the commencement or completion of preclinical studies and clinical trials and the submission of regulatory filings including IND submissions From time to time we may publicly announce the expected timing of some of these milestones All of these milestones are and will be based on a variety of assumptions The actual timing of these milestones can vary significantly compared to our estimates in some cases for reasons beyond our control We may experience numerous unforeseen events during or as a result of any future clinical trials that we conduct that could delay or prevent our ability to receive marketing approval or commercialize our product candidates Gene therapy is a novel technology which makes it difficult to predict the time and cost of product candidate development and subsequently obtaining regulatory approval Currently only a limited number of gene therapy products have been approved in the United States and in foreign countries Our current product candidates are based on gene therapy technology and our future success depends on the successful development of this novel therapeutic approach The regulatory requirements that govern any novel gene therapy product candidates we develop are not entirely clear and are subject to change The clinical study requirements of the FDA and exUS regulatory agencies and the criteria these regulators use to determine the safety and efficacy of a product candidate vary substantially according to the type complexity novelty and intended use and market of the 75 Table of Contents potential products The regulatory approval process for novel product candidates such as ours can be more expensive and take longer than for other better known or extensively studied product candidates Further as we are developing novel treatments for diseases in which there is little clinical experience with new endpoints and methodologies there is heightened risk that the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory bodies may not consider the clinical trial endpoints to provide clinically meaningful results and the resulting clinical data and results may be more difficult to analyze To date only a limited number of gene therapy products have been approved in the United States and foreign countries which makes it difficult to determine how long it will take or how much it will cost to obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates in the United States or other jurisdictions Further approvals by an exUS regulatory agency may not be indicative of what the FDA may require for approval or vice versa Our product candidates may cause undesirable and unforeseen side effects which could delay or prevent their advancement into clinical trials or regulatory approval limit the commercial potential or result in significant negative consequences While new AAV vectors have been developed to reduce side effects previously reported in thirdparty gene therapy treatments gene therapy is still a relatively new approach to disease treatment and additional adverse side effects could develop There also is the potential risk of delayed adverse events following exposure to gene therapy products due to persistent biologic activity of the genetic material or other components of products used to carry the genetic material Possible adverse side effects that could occur with treatment with gene therapy products include an immunologic reaction early after administration which while not necessarily adverse to the patients health could substantially limit the effectiveness of the treatment For example in previous thirdparty clinical trials involving AAV vectors for gene therapy some subjects experienced the development of a Tcell antibody response whereby after the vector is within the target cells the cellular immune response system triggers the removal of transduced cells by activated Tcells Other recent clinical trials involving high doses of AAV vectors have also resulted in liver damage and death Further following administration of any AAV vector patients are likely to develop NAbs specific to the vector administered Other preclinical studies have suggested that high dosages of AAV administration may result in toxicity due to degeneration of the dorsal root ganglia Preliminary results of our NHP toxicology studies for our PBGM01 and PBFT02 product candidates have demonstrated trigeminal ganglia and dorsal root ganglia toxicity Based on these results and if our vectors demonstrate a similar effect in other programs we may decide or be required to perform additional preclinical studies or to halt or delay further clinical development of our product candidates In addition to side effects caused by the product candidate the administration process or related procedures also can cause adverse side effects Each of our lead product candidates are expected to be administered by injection into the ICM While this method of administration has been available for decades its use for therapies is relatively new no therapies are currently approved using ICM administration and it may be perceived as having greater risk than more common methods of administration such as intravenous injection If any such adverse events occur our clinical trials could be suspended or terminated If we cannot demonstrate that any adverse events were not caused by the drug or administration process or related procedures the FDA or exUS regulatory authorities could order us to cease further development of or deny approval of our product candidates for any or all targeted indications Even if we are able to demonstrate that all future serious adverse events are not productrelated such occurrences could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the trial Moreover if we elect or are required to not initiate delay suspend or terminate any future clinical trial of any of our product candidates the commercial prospects of such product candidates may be harmed and our ability to generate product revenues from any of these product candidates may be delayed or eliminated Any of these occurrences may harm our ability to develop other product candidates and may harm our business financial condition and prospects significantly Additionally if any of our product candidates receives marketing approval the FDA could require us to adopt a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies or REMS to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh its risks which may include among other things a Medication Guide outlining the risks of the product for distribution to patients and a communication plan to health care practitioners Furthermore if we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by our product candidate several potentially significant negative consequences could result including  regulatory authorities may suspend or withdraw approvals of such product candidate 76 Table of Contents  regulatory authorities may require additional warnings on the label  we may be required to change the way a product candidate is administered or conduct additional clinical trials  we could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients and  our reputation may suffer  Any of these occurrences may harm our business financial condition and prospects significantly Adverse public perception of genetic medicines may negatively impact regulatory approval of andor demand for our potential products Regulatory approval of andor demand for our potential products will depend in part on public acceptance of the use of genetic medicine for the prevention or treatment of human diseases Public attitudes may be influenced by claims that genetic medicines are unsafe unethical or immoral and consequently our products may not gain the acceptance of the public or the medical community Adverse public attitudes may adversely impact our ability to enroll clinical trials Moreover our success will depend upon physicians prescribing and their patients being willing to receive treatments that involve the use of product candidates we may develop There have been several significant adverse side effects reported in genetic medicine treatments in the past For example in 1999 there was public backlash against gene therapy following the death of a clinical trial subject in a gene therapy clinical trial that utilized an adenovirus vector It was later discovered that adenoviruses could generate an extreme immune system reaction that can be lifethreatening Dr Wilson our Chief Scientific Advisor was a coinvestigator of the 1999 trial while he was Director of the Institute for Human Gene Therapy of Penn Serious adverse events in our clinical trials or other clinical trials involving gene therapy by us or our competitors even if not ultimately attributable to the relevant product candidates and the resulting publicity could result in increased government regulation unfavorable public perception and potential regulatory delays in the clinical testing or approval of our product candidates As an organization we have limited experience designing and no experience implementing clinical trials and we have never conducted pivotal clinical trials Failure to adequately design a trial or incorrect assumptions about the design of the trial could adversely affect the ability to initiate the trial enroll patients complete the trial or obtain regulatory approval on the basis of the trial results as well as lead to increased or unexpected costs The design and implementation of clinical trials is a complex process As an organization we have limited experience designing and no experience implementing clinical trials and we may not successfully or costeffectively design and implement clinical trials that achieve our desired clinical endpoints efficiently or at all A clinical trial that is not well designed may delay or even prevent initiation of the trial can lead to increased difficulty in enrolling patients may make it more difficult to obtain regulatory approval for the product candidate on the basis of the study results or even if a product candidate is approved could make it more difficult to commercialize the product successfully or obtain reimbursement from thirdparty payors Additionally a trial that is not welldesigned could be inefficient or more expensive than it otherwise would have been or we may incorrectly estimate the costs to implement the clinical trial which could lead to a shortfall in funding The disorders we seek to treat have low prevalence and it may be difficult to identify patients with these disorders which may lead to delays in enrollment for our trials or slower commercial revenue if approved Genetically defined disorders generally and especially those for which our current product candidates are targeted have low incidence and prevalence For example we estimate incidence of infantile GM1 is approximately 14 in 100000 live births that the incidence of Krabbe disease is approximately 26 in 100000 births and that there are approximately 3000 to 6000 people in the United States with FTDGRN While certain states currently have mandatory newborn genetic screening for Krabbe disease there is no mandatory screening for GM1 Without mandatory screening it may be difficult for us to identify a sufficient number of eligible patients to conduct our clinical trials These could be significant obstacles to the timely recruitment and enrollment of a sufficient number of eligible patients into our trials Further we expect to rely in part on our relationships with the Orphan Disease Center and other patient advocacy groups to assist in 77 Table of Contents identifying eligible patients and any deterioration of those relationships could impede our ability to successfully enroll patients Patient enrollment may be affected by other factors including  the severity of the disease under investigation  design of the study protocol  the eligibility criteria for the trial  the perceived risks benefits and convenience of administration of the product candidate being studied  our efforts to facilitate timely enrollment in clinical trials  the availability of other clinical trials being conducted for the same indication  the patient referral practices of physicians and  the proximity and availability of clinical trial sites to prospective patients  Our inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients with these diseases for our planned clinical trials would result in significant delays and could require us to not initiate or abandon one or more clinical trials altogether Enrollment delays in our clinical trials may result in increased development costs for our product candidates which would cause the value of our company to decline and limit our ability to obtain additional financing Additionally our projections of both the number of people who have GM1 FTD Krabbe disease and our other product candidates as well as the people with these diseases who have the potential to benefit from treatment with our product candidates are based on estimates including third party analyses commissioned by us The total addressable market opportunity for our product candidates will ultimately depend upon among other things the final approved product labeling for each of our product candidates if our product candidates are approved for sale in our target indications acceptance by the medical community and patient access drug pricing and reimbursement The number of patients globally may turn out to be lower than expected patients may not be otherwise amenable to treatment with our products or new patients may become increasingly difficult to identify or gain access to all of which would adversely affect our results of operations and our business Our products may potentially be dosed on a onetime basis which means that patients who enroll in our clinical trials may not be eligible to receive our products on a commercial basis if they are approved leading to lower revenue potential Even if we complete the necessary clinical trials we cannot predict when or if we will receive regulatory approval to commercialize a product candidate and the approval may be for a more narrow indication than we seek Prior to commercialization our product candidates must be approved by the FDA pursuant to a biologics license application or BLA in the United States and by similar regulatory authorities outside the United States The process of obtaining marketing approvals both in the United States and abroad is expensive and takes many years if approval is obtained at all and can vary substantially based upon a variety of factors including the type complexity and novelty of the product candidates involved Failure to obtain marketing approval for a product candidate will prevent us from commercializing the product candidate We have not received approval to market any of our product candidates from regulatory authorities in any jurisdiction Our company does not have experience in submitting and supporting the applications necessary to gain marketing approvals Securing marketing approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to regulatory authorities for each therapeutic indication to establish the product candidates safety and efficacy Securing marketing approval also requires the submission of information about the product manufacturing process to and inspection of manufacturing facilities by the regulatory authorities Our product candidates may not be effective may be only moderately effective or may prove to have undesirable or unintended side effects toxicities or other characteristics that may preclude our obtaining marketing approval or prevent or limit commercial use Regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data are insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical clinical or other studies In addition varying interpretations of the data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing could delay limit or prevent marketing approval of a product candidate 78 Table of Contents Approval of our product candidates may be delayed or refused for many reasons including the following  the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with the design or implementation of our clinical trials including the methods for collecting and analyzing data the statistical analysis plan and the lack of a concurrent control arm or a decision to use external or historical controls  the FDA may not agree that the efficacy endpoints used in our clinical trials are appropriate to establish clinical benefit in the intended populations  we may be unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities that our product candidates are safe and effective for any of their proposed indications  the results of clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities for approval  we may be unable to demonstrate that our product candidates clinical and other benefits outweigh their safety risks  the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with our interpretation of data from preclinical programs or clinical trials  the data collected from clinical trials of our product candidates may not be sufficient to support the submission of a BLA or other comparable submission in foreign jurisdictions or to obtain regulatory approval in the United States or elsewhere  the facilities of the thirdparty manufacturers with which we contract may not be adequate to support approval of our product candidates and  the approval policies or regulations of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval  Even if our product candidates meet their safety and efficacy endpoints in clinical trials the regulatory authorities may not complete their review processes in a timely manner or we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval Additional delays may result if an FDA Advisory Committee or other regulatory authority recommends nonapproval or restrictions on approval In addition we may experience delays or rejections based upon additional government regulation from future legislation or administrative action or changes in regulatory authority policy during the period of product development clinical trials and the review process Regulatory authorities also may approve a product candidate for more limited indications than requested or they may impose significant limitations in the form of narrow indications warnings or REMS These regulatory authorities may require precautions or contraindications with respect to conditions of use or they may grant approval subject to the performance of costly postmarketing clinical trials In addition regulatory authorities may not approve the product labeling claims that are necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of our product candidates Any of the foregoing scenarios could materially harm the commercial prospects for our product candidates and materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects Further the regulatory authorities may require concurrent approval of a companion diagnostic device For our product candidates it may be necessary to use FDAcleared or FDAapproved diagnostic tests to diagnose patients or to assure the safe and effective use of product candidates in trial subjects The FDA refers to such tests as in vitro companion diagnostic devices The FDA has issued guidance describing the agencys current thinking about the development and regulation of in vitro companion diagnostic devices The final guidance articulates a policy position that when an in vitro diagnostic device is essential to the safe and effective use of a therapeutic product the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of the diagnostic device at the same time that the FDA approves the therapeutic product At this point it is unclear how the FDA will apply this policy to our current or future gene therapy product candidates Should the FDA deem genetic tests used for diagnosing patients for our therapies to be in vitro companion diagnostics requiring FDA clearance or approval we may face significant delays or obstacles in obtaining approval of a BLA for our product candidates 79 Table of Contents The FDA and other exUS regulatory agencies have demonstrated caution in their regulation of gene therapy treatments Ethical and legal concerns about gene therapy and genetic testing may result in additional regulations or restrictions on the development and commercialization of our product candidates which may be difficult to predict The FDA and other exUS regulatory agencies at both the federal and state level in the United States US congressional committees and foreign governments have expressed interest in further regulating the biotechnology industry including gene therapy and genetic testing Any such further regulation may delay or prevent commercialization of some or all of our product candidates Regulatory requirements in the United States and abroad governing gene therapy products have changed frequently and may continue to change in the future In addition to the FDA the Institutional Biosafety Committee and IRB of each institution at which we conduct our planned clinical trials would need to review the proposed clinical trial to assess the safety of the trial Within the FDA the Office of Cellular Tissue and Gene Therapies within the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research or CBER consolidates the review of gene therapy and related products and the Cellular Tissue and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee advises CBER on its review Adverse developments in clinical trials of gene therapy products conducted by others may cause the FDA or other oversight bodies to change the requirements for approval of any of our product candidates These regulatory review committees and advisory groups and the new guidelines they promulgate may lengthen the regulatory review process require us to perform additional studies or trials increase our development costs lead to changes in regulatory positions and interpretations delay or prevent approval and commercialization of our product candidates or lead to significant postapproval limitations or restrictions As we advance our product candidates we will be required to consult with these regulatory and advisory groups and comply with applicable guidelines If we fail to do so we may be required to delay or discontinue development of such product candidates These additional processes may result in a review and approval process that is longer than we otherwise would have expected Delays as a result of an increased or lengthier regulatory approval process or further restrictions on the development of our product candidates can be costly and could negatively impact our ability to complete clinical trials and commercialize our current and future product candidates in a timely manner if at all Changes in funding for the FDA and other government agencies could hinder their ability to hire and retain key leadership and other personnel or otherwise prevent new products and services from being developed or commercialized in a timely manner which could negatively impact our business The ability of the FDA to review and approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors including government budget and funding levels ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept the payment of user fees and statutory regulatory and policy changes In addition government funding of other government agencies that fund research and development activities is subject to the political process which is inherently fluid and unpredictable Disruptions at the FDA and other agencies may also slow the time necessary for new drugs to be reviewed andor approved by necessary government agencies which would adversely affect our business For example over the last several years including for 35 days beginning on December 22 2018 the US government has shut down several times and certain regulatory agencies such as the FDA have had to furlough critical FDA employees and stop important activities If a prolonged government shutdown occurs it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA to timely review and process our regulatory submissions which could have a material adverse effect on our business Failure to obtain marketing approval in foreign jurisdictions would prevent our product candidates from being marketed abroad and will limit our ability to realize their full market potential In order to eventually market any of our product candidates in any particular foreign jurisdiction we must establish and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements on a jurisdictionbyjurisdiction basis regarding safety and efficacy Approval by the FDA in the United States if obtained does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions In addition clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries and regulatory approval in one country does not guarantee regulatory approval in any other country Approval processes vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and validation and 80 Table of Contents additional administrative review periods Seeking foreign regulatory approval could result in difficulties and costs for us and require additional preclinical studies or clinical trials which could be costly and timeconsuming Regulatory requirements can vary widely from country to country and could delay or prevent the introduction of our products in those countries The foreign regulatory approval process involves all of the risks associated with FDA approval In addition gene therapy products are considered geneticallymodified organism or GMO products and are regulated as such in each country Designation of the type of GMO product and subsequent handling and disposal requirements can vary across countries and is variable throughout the European Union Addressing each specific country requirement and obtaining approval to commence a clinical trial in these countries could result in delays in starting conducting or completing a clinical trial We do not have any product candidates approved for sale in any jurisdiction including international markets and we do not have experience in obtaining regulatory approval in international markets and expect to rely on thirdparty consultants If we fail to comply with regulatory requirements in international markets or to obtain and maintain required approvals or if regulatory approvals in international markets are delayed our target market will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of our products will be unrealized In addition the United Kingdoms exit from the European Union or the EU which is referred to as Brexit continues to create political and economic uncertainty particularly in the United Kingdom and the EU Since a significant proportion of the regulatory framework in the United Kingdom is derived from EU directives and regulations the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU could materially impact the regulatory regime with respect to the approval of our product candidates in the United Kingdom or the EU We may not be successful in our efforts to build a pipeline of additional product candidates Our business model is centered on developing therapies for patients with rare monogenic CNS disorders by establishing focused selection criteria to select develop and advance product candidates that we believe will have a high probability of technical and regulatory success through development into commercialization We may not be able to continue to identify and develop new product candidates in addition to the pipeline of product candidates that we have established through our collaboration with Penns GTP Even if we are successful in continuing to build our pipeline the potential product candidates that we identify may not be suitable for clinical development For example they may be shown to have harmful side effects or other characteristics that indicate that they are unlikely to be drugs that will receive marketing approval and achieve market acceptance If we do not successfully develop and commercialize product candidates based upon our approach we will not be able to obtain product revenue in future periods which likely would result in significant harm to our financial position and adversely affect our stock price Risks Related to Our Reliance on Third Parties We currently rely exclusively on our collaboration with Penn for our preclinical research and development programs including for discovering preclinically developing and conducting all INDenabling studies for our lead product candidates and our nearterm future pipeline Failure or delay of Penn to fulfil all or part of its obligations to us under the agreement a breakdown in collaboration between the parties or a complete or partial loss of this relationship would materially harm our business Our collaboration with Penn is critical to our business We entered into a Research Collaboration  License Agreement dated September 18 2018 as amended and restated in May 2020 or the Penn Agreement with Penn to discover and develop certain AAV vector based therapeutics and the products developed under such collaboration currently represent all of our product pipeline and research programs We currently rely exclusively on Penn for all of our preclinical research and development capabilities and in particular GTP under the direction of Dr Wilson Pursuant to the Penn Agreement Penn is responsible for discovery preclinical development activities including all INDenabling nonclinical studies and research grade manufacturing and other collaborative activities set forth in the plan for the funded research Either party has the right in certain circumstances to terminate the collaboration pursuant to the terms of the Penn Agreement If Penn delays or fails to perform its obligations under the Penn Agreement disagrees with our interpretation of the terms of the collaboration or our discovery plan or terminates our existing agreement our pipeline of product candidates would be significantly adversely affected and our prospects will be materially harmed 81 Table of Contents The term of the research funding portion of the Penn Agreement under which we have the ability to acquire exclusive rights to additional gene therapy products for rare monogenic CNS indications expires in May 2025 In addition the discovery program under which we have rights to new technologies for our product candidates is currently also set to expire in May 2025 If we seek to extend our collaboration we will need to negotiate a new or amended agreement which may not be available to us on equally favorable terms if at all Penn has also entered into collaborations with third parties including certain of our competitors addressing targets and disease indications outside the scope of our collaboration As a result Penn may have competing interests with respect to their priorities and resources We may have disagreements with Penn with respect to the interpretation of the Penn Agreement use of resources or otherwise that could cause our relationship with Penn to deteriorate As a result Penn may reduce their focus on and resources allocated to our programs potentially delaying or terminating our ability to advance product candidates through preclinical studies Additionally if Dr Wilson were to leave Penn or to otherwise no longer be meaningfully involved with us our preclinical research and development capabilities may be substantially reduced Further under the Penn Agreement Penn is primarily responsible for prosecuting and maintaining our licensed intellectual property and it may fail to properly prosecute maintain or defend such intellectual property In such event if we are unable to otherwise maintain or defend such intellectual property we could face the potential invalidation of the intellectual property or be subjected to litigation or arbitration any of which would be timeconsuming and expensive To enforce the licensed intellectual property rights under the Penn Agreement we will need to coordinate with Penn which could slow down or hamper our ability to enforce our licensed intellectual property rights In such event we could face increased competition that could materially and adversely affect our business We rely on third parties to conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials and rely on them to perform other tasks for us If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties meet expected deadlines or comply with regulatory requirements we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates and our business could be substantially harmed Although we have recruited a team that has experience with clinical trials as a company we have no experience in conducting clinical trials Moreover we currently rely exclusively on Penn for our discovery and preclinical research and will continue to rely upon medical institutions clinical investigators contract laboratories and other third parties or our CROs to conduct clinical trials for our product candidates We expect to rely heavily on these parties for execution of preclinical and future clinical trials for our product candidates and control only certain aspects of their activities If these parties reduce the levels of efforts and resources to our product candidate activities prioritize work with a competitor of ours or if a dispute were to arise between us and these parties they may not meet our expected deadlines or provide us with sufficient materials for our regulatory filings Nevertheless we will be responsible for ensuring that each of our preclinical and clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol legal and regulatory requirements and scientific standards and our reliance on CROs will not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities For any violations of laws and regulations during the conduct of our preclinical studies and clinical trials we could be subject to warning letters or enforcement action that may include civil penalties up to and including criminal prosecution We Penn and our CROs will be required to comply with regulations including cGCPs for conducting monitoring recording and reporting the results of preclinical and clinical trials to ensure that the data and results are scientifically credible and accurate and that the trial patients are adequately informed of the potential risks of participating in clinical trials and their rights are protected These regulations are enforced by the FDA the Competent Authorities of the Member States of the European Economic Area and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for any drugs in clinical development The FDA enforces cGCP regulations through periodic inspections of clinical trial sponsors principal investigators and trial sites If we or our CROs fail to comply with applicable cGCPs the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications We cannot assure you that upon inspection the FDA will determine that any of our future clinical trials will comply with cGCPs In addition our clinical trials must be conducted with product candidates produced in accordance with the requirements in cGMP regulations Our failure or the failure of our CROs to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat clinical trials which would delay the regulatory approval process and could also subject us to enforcement action 82 Table of Contents Although we currently design and intend to continue designing our planned clinical trials for our product candidates for the foreseeable future CROs will conduct all of our planned clinical trials As a result many important aspects of our development programs including their conduct and timing will be outside of our direct control Our reliance on third parties to conduct future preclinical studies and clinical trials will also result in less daytoday control over the management of data developed through preclinical studies and clinical trials than would be the case if we were relying entirely upon our own staff If any of our relationships with these thirdparty CROs terminate we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs If CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines if they need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols regulatory requirements or for other reasons any preclinical studies or clinical trials with which such CROs are associated with may be extended delayed or terminated In such cases we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our product candidates As a result our financial results and the commercial prospects for our product candidates in the subject indication could be harmed our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenue could be delayed We rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials If those third parties do not perform as contractually required fail to satisfy legal or regulatory requirements miss expected deadlines or terminate the relationship our development program could be delayed with potentially material and adverse effects on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects We rely on thirdparty clinical investigators CROs clinical data management organizations and consultants to assist or provide the design conduct supervision and monitoring of clinical trials of our product candidates Because we rely and intend to rely on these third parties and will not have the ability to conduct all clinical trials independently we will have less control over the timing quality and other aspects of clinical trials than we would have had we conducted them on our own These investigators CROs and consultants will not be our employees and we will have limited control over the amount of time and resources that they dedicate to our programs These third parties may have contractual relationships with other entities some of which may be our competitors which may draw time and resources from our programs The third parties with which we may contract might not be diligent careful or timely in conducting our clinical trials resulting in the clinical trials being delayed or unsuccessful If we cannot contract with acceptable third parties on commercially reasonable terms or at all or if these third parties do not carry out their contractual duties satisfy legal and regulatory requirements for the conduct of preclinical studies or clinical trials or meet expected deadlines our clinical development programs could be delayed and otherwise adversely affected In all events we will be responsible for ensuring that each of our preclinical studies and clinical trials are conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial as well as applicable legal and regulatory requirements The FDA generally requires preclinical studies to be conducted in accordance with good laboratory practices and clinical trials to be conducted in accordance with good clinical practices including for designing conducting recording and reporting the results of preclinical studies and clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights integrity and confidentiality of clinical trial participants are protected Our reliance on third parties that we do not control will not relieve us of these responsibilities and requirements Any adverse development or delay in our preclinical studies or clinical trials as a result of our reliance on third parties could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects If any of our relationships with these thirdparty CROs or others terminate we may not be able to enter into alternative arrangements or to do so on commercially reasonable terms Switching or adding additional CROs involves additional cost and requires management time and focus In addition there is a natural transition period when a new CRO begins work As a result delays may occur which can materially adversely impact our ability to meet our desired clinical development timelines 83 Table of Contents We may in the future enter into collaborations with other third parties for the discovery development and commercialization of our product candidates If any of our current or future collaborators cease development efforts under our collaboration agreements or if any of those agreements are terminated these collaborations may fail to lead to commercial products and we may never receive milestone payments or future royalties under these agreements We may in the future enter into thirdparty collaborations for research development and commercialization of other therapeutic technologies or product candidates Biotechnology companies are our likely future collaborators for any marketing distribution development licensing or broader collaboration arrangements With any future collaboration agreements we expect to have limited control over the amount and timing of resources that our collaborators dedicate to the development or commercialization of our product candidates Moreover our ability to generate revenues from these arrangements will depend on our collaborators abilities to successfully perform the functions assigned to them in these arrangements  Our potential future collaborations involving our product candidates may pose the following risks to us   collaborators have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations  collaborators may not pursue development and commercialization of our product candidates or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on preclinical studies or clinical trial results changes in the collaborators strategic focus or available funding or external factors such as an acquisition that diverts resources or creates competing priorities  collaborators may delay clinical trials provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program stop a clinical trial or abandon a product candidate repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing  collaborators could independently develop or develop with third parties products that compete directly or indirectly with our product candidates if the collaborators believe that competitive products are more likely to be successfully developed or can be commercialized under terms that are more economically attractive than ours  collaborators with marketing and distribution rights to one or more products may not commit sufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of such product or products  collaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to litigation or potential liability  collaborators may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties which may expose us to litigation indemnification obligations and potential liability  disputes may arise between the collaborators and us that result in the delay or termination of the research development or commercialization of our product candidates or that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management attention and resources collaborations may be terminated and if terminated may result in a need for additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable product candidates  if a present or future collaborator of ours were to be involved in a business combination the continued pursuit and emphasis on our product development or commercialization program under such collaboration could be delayed diminished or terminated and  collaboration agreements may restrict our right to independently pursue new product candidates  As a result of the foregoing any future collaboration agreements may not lead to development or commercialization of our product candidates in the most efficient manner or at all If a collaborator of ours were to be involved in a business combination the continued pursuit and emphasis on our product development or commercialization program could be delayed diminished or terminated Any failure to successfully develop or commercialize our product candidates pursuant to our current or any future collaboration agreements could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 84 Table of Contents Moreover to the extent that any of our existing or future collaborators were to terminate a collaboration agreement we may be forced to independently develop our product candidates and research programs including funding preclinical studies or clinical trials assuming marketing and distribution costs and maintaining and defending intellectual property rights or in certain instances abandon product candidates altogether any of which could result in a change to our business plan and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects We may not be successful in finding additional collaborators for continuing development of certain of our product candidates or successfully commercializing or competing in the market for certain indications We may decide to pursue collaborations with additional pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for the development and potential commercialization of some of our product candidates We face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators Any new collaboration may be on terms that are not optimal for us and we may not be able to maintain any new collaboration if for example development or approval of a product candidate is delayed sales of an approved product candidate do not meet expectations or the collaborator terminates the collaboration In addition a significant number of recent business combinations among large pharmaceutical companies has resulted in a reduced number of potential future collaborators Whether we reach a definitive agreement for a collaboration will depend among other things upon our assessment of the collaborators resources and expertise the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed collaborators evaluation of a number of factors Those factors may include the design or results of clinical trials the likelihood of approval by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States the potential market for the subject product candidate the costs and complexities of manufacturing and delivering such product candidate to patients the potential of competing drugs the existence of uncertainty with respect to our ownership of technology which can exist if there is a challenge to such ownership without regard to the merits of the challenge and industry and market conditions generally The collaborator may also consider alternative product candidates or technologies for similar indications that may be available to collaborate on and whether such a collaboration could be more attractive than the one with us for our product candidate The terms of any additional collaborations or other arrangements that we may establish may not be favorable to us We may also be restricted under existing collaboration agreements from entering into future agreements on certain terms with potential collaborators Collaborations are complex and timeconsuming to negotiate and document In addition there have been a significant number of recent business combinations among large pharmaceutical companies that have resulted in a reduced number of potential future collaborators We may not be able to negotiate additional collaborations on a timely basis on acceptable terms or at all If we are unable to do so we may have to curtail the development of the product candidate for which we are seeking to collaborate reduce or delay its development program or one or more of our other development programs delay its potential commercialization or reduce the scope of any sales or marketing activities or increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense If we elect to increase our expenditures to fund development or commercialization activities on our own we may need to obtain additional capital which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all If we do not have sufficient funds we may not be able to further develop our product candidates or bring them to market and generate product revenue We may have conflicts with our collaborators that could delay or prevent the development or commercialization of our product candidates We may have conflicts with our collaborators including Penn such as conflicts concerning the interpretation of preclinical or clinical data the achievement of milestones the interpretation of contractual obligations payments for services development obligations or the ownership of intellectual property developed during our collaboration If any conflicts arise with any of our collaborators including Penn such collaborator may act in a manner that is adverse to our best interests Any such disagreement could result in one or more of the following each of which could delay or prevent the development or commercialization of our product candidates and in turn prevent us from generating revenues unwillingness on the part of a collaborator to pay us milestone payments or royalties we believe are due to us under a collaboration which could require us to raise additional capital uncertainty regarding ownership of intellectual property rights arising from our collaborative activities which could prevent us from entering into additional collaborations unwillingness by the collaborator to cooperate in the development or manufacture of the product including providing us 85 Table of Contents with product data or materials unwillingness on the part of a collaborator to keep us informed regarding the progress of its development and commercialization activities or to permit public disclosure of the results of those activities initiating of litigation or alternative dispute resolution options by either party to resolve the dispute or attempts by either party to terminate the relevant agreement We may in the future seek to engage in strategic transactions to acquire or inlicense new products product candidates or technologies If we are unable to successfully complete or realize the benefits from such transactions it may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize product candidates impact our cash position increase our expenses and present significant distractions to our management From time to time we may consider strategic transactions such as additional collaborations acquisitions of companies asset purchases joint ventures and inlicensing of new products product candidates or technologies that we believe will complement or augment our existing business If we acquire assets with promising markets or technologies we may not be able to realize the benefit of acquiring such assets if we are not able to successfully integrate them with our existing technologies We may encounter numerous difficulties in developing testing manufacturing and marketing any new products resulting from a strategic acquisition that delay or prevent us from realizing their expected benefits or enhancing our business We cannot assure you that following any such strategic transaction we will achieve the expected synergies to justify the transaction For example such transactions may require us to incur nonrecurring or other charges increase our near and longterm expenditures and pose significant integration or implementation challenges or disrupt our management or business These transactions would entail numerous operational and financial risks including exposure to unknown liabilities disruption of our business and diversion of our managements time and attention in order to manage a collaboration or develop acquired products product candidates or technologies incurrence of substantial debt or dilutive issuances of equity securities to pay transaction consideration or costs higher than expected acquisition or integration costs writedowns of assets or goodwill or impairment charges increased amortization expenses difficulty and cost in facilitating the transaction or combining the operations and personnel of any acquired business impairment of relationships with key suppliers manufacturers or customers of any acquired business due to changes in management and ownership and the inability to retain key employees of any acquired business Accordingly although there can be no assurance that we will undertake or successfully complete any transactions of the nature described above any transactions that we do complete may be subject to the foregoing or other risks and would have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects Conversely any failure to enter any strategic transaction that would be beneficial to us could delay the development and potential commercialization of our product candidates and have a negative impact on the competitiveness of any product candidate that reaches market Risks Related to Manufacturing Gene therapies are novel complex and difficult to manufacture We could experience manufacturing problems that result in delays in our development or commercialization programs or otherwise harm our business We currently rely on third parties to develop manufacture and test clinical supplies of our product candidates  including the materials used to administer our product candidates For our initial clinical trials we rely on the manufacturing facility of Catalent Maryland formerly Paragon Bioscience or Catalent for supply of our product candidates and on Penn to manage the transfer of technology to Catalent that is necessary for production We are in the process of establishing internal manufacturing operations for certain CMC and analytical capabilities and expect to establish our own manufacturing facility for longterm commercial market supply However we have limited experience as a company in developing manufacturing facilities We may face delays in building out our new manufacturing facility or in constructing new facilities and transferring technology to our facilities or have difficulty hiring experts to staff and operate our own manufacturing facility and accordingly our production capacity could be limited The manufacturing processes used to produce our product candidates are complex novel and have not been validated for commercial use Many factors could cause production interruptions including equipment malfunctions facility contamination raw 86 Table of Contents material shortages or contamination natural disasters disruption in utility services human error or disruptions in the operations of our suppliers Our product candidates require processing steps that are more complex than those required for most small molecule drugs Moreover unlike small molecules the physical and chemical properties of a biologic such as ours generally cannot be fully characterized As a result assays of the finished product may not be sufficient to ensure that the product is consistent from lottolot or will perform in the intended manner Accordingly we employ multiple steps to control the manufacturing process to assure that the process works consistently and the product candidate is made strictly and consistently in compliance with the process Problems with the manufacturing process even minor deviations from the normal process could result in product defects or manufacturing failures that result in lot failures low lot yields product recalls product liability claims or insufficient inventory As a result we may encounter problems achieving adequate quantities and quality of clinicalgrade materials that meet the FDA or other applicable standards or specifications with consistent and acceptable production yields and costs In addition the FDA and exUS regulatory authorities may require us to submit samples of any lot of any approved product together with the protocols showing the results of applicable tests at any time Under some circumstances the FDA or exUS regulatory authorities may require that we not distribute a lot until the agency authorizes its release Slight deviations in the manufacturing process including those affecting quality attributes and stability may result in unacceptable changes in the product that could result in lot failures low lot yields or product recalls Lot failures low lot yields or product recalls could cause us to delay product launches or clinical trials which could be costly to us and otherwise harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects We or our thirdparty collaborators also may encounter problems hiring and retaining the experienced scientific qualitycontrol and manufacturing personnel needed to operate our manufacturing processes which could result in delays in production or difficulties in maintaining compliance with applicable regulatory requirements Any problems in our or our thirdparty collaborators manufacturing process or facilities could result in delays in our planned clinical trials and increased costs and could make us a less attractive collaborator for potential partners including larger biotechnology companies and academic research institutions which could limit our access to additional attractive development programs It could also require us to find alternative manufacturing processes which may be unavailable to us on attractive terms or at all Problems in our manufacturing process could restrict our ability to meet potential future market demand for our products Changes in methods of product candidate manufacturing or formulation may result in additional costs or delay As product candidates proceed through preclinical studies to latestage clinical trials towards potential approval and commercialization it is common that various aspects of the development program such as manufacturing methods and formulation are altered along the way in an effort to optimize processes and results Such changes carry the risk that they will not achieve these intended objectives Any of these changes could cause our product candidates to perform differently and affect the results of planned clinical trials or other future clinical trials conducted with the materials manufactured using altered processes Such changes may also require additional testing FDA notification or FDA approval This could delay completion of clinical trials require the conduct of bridging clinical trials or the repetition of one or more clinical trials increase clinical trial costs delay approval of our product candidates and jeopardize our ability to commence sales and generate revenue We currently rely and expect to continue to rely on thirdparty manufacturers to produce clinical supply of our product candidates and we have not entered into binding agreements with any such manufacturers to support commercialization The competition for gene therapy contract development manufacturing and testing services is intense Additionally these manufacturers do not have experience producing our product candidates at commercial levels and may not achieve the necessary regulatory approvals or produce our product candidates at the quality quantities locations and timing needed to support commercialization While we are in the process of establishing manufacturing capability for certain CMC activities we do not currently plan to independently manufacture most of the material for our planned clinical programs We currently rely and expect to 87 Table of Contents continue to rely on third parties for the production of our preclinical study and planned clinical trial materials including the materials used to administer our product candidates and therefore we can control only certain aspects of their activities The competition for gene therapy contract development manufacturing and testing is intense Reliance on thirdparty manufacturers may expose us to different risks than if we were to manufacture product candidates ourselves including but not limited to potential competition from other genetic biotechnology companies for the use of such thirdparty manufacturers While we have secured an agreement with Catalent to manufacture clinical supply of our product candidates we have not yet secured manufacturing capabilities for commercial quantities of our product candidates Although we intend to establish our own manufacturing facility for longterm commercial market supply we may need to rely on thirdparty manufacturers for commercialization of our product candidates if regulatory approval is achieved To date while we have a collaboration agreement with Catalent for a dedicated clean room suite we have only entered into agreements with such manufacturer to support our clinical studies We may be unable to negotiate binding agreements with the manufacturers to support our potential commercialization activities at commercially reasonable terms Before any of our thirdparty manufacturers and suppliers can begin to commercially manufacture our product candidates including the materials used to administer our product candidates they must demonstrate to regulatory authorities that the planned chemistry manufacturing and controls for our gene therapy product candidates meet certain requirements Manufacturing of product candidates for clinical and commercial purposes must comply with the cGMP and applicable exUS regulatory requirements The cGMP requirements govern quality control and documentation policies and procedures Complying with cGMP and exUS regulatory requirements will require that we expend time money and effort in production recordkeeping and quality control to assure that our product candidates meet applicable specifications and other requirements Our thirdparty manufacturers also must demonstrate to the FDA that they can make the product candidate in accordance with the cGMP requirements as part of a preapproval inspection prior to FDA approval of the product candidate Failure to pass a preapproval inspection might significantly delay FDA approval of our product candidates If any of our thirdparty manufacturers fail to comply with these requirements we would be subject to possible regulatory action which could limit the jurisdictions in which we are permitted to sell our products As a result our business financial condition and results of operations may be materially harmed In addition our thirdparty manufacturers may fail to comply with cGMP regulations or similar regulatory requirements outside the United States Our failure or the failure of our thirdparty manufacturers to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us including clinical holds fines injunctions civil penalties delays suspension or withdrawal of approvals license revocation seizures or recalls of product candidates or products operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions any of which could significantly and adversely affect supplies of our product candidates Even if our thirdparty manufacturers comply with applicable regulatory requirements we cannot assure you that they will be able to successfully manufacture additional product candidates at a larger scale in a timely or economical manner or at all If they are unable to successfully increase our manufacturing scale or capacity the development testing and clinical trials of our product candidates may be delayed or infeasible and regulatory approval or commercial launch of any resulting product may be delayed or not obtained which could significantly harm our business Our thirdparty manufacturers and suppliers use biological materials and may use hazardous materials and any claims relating to improper handling storage or disposal of these materials could be time consuming or costly Our thirdparty manufacturers and suppliers may use hazardous materials including chemicals and biological agents and compounds that could be dangerous to human health and safety or the environment The operations of our thirdparty manufacturers and suppliers also produce hazardous waste products Federal state and local laws and regulations govern the use generation manufacture storage handling and disposal of these materials and wastes Compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations may be expensive and current or future environmental laws and regulations may impair our product development efforts In addition we cannot entirely eliminate the risk of accidental injury or contamination from these materials or wastes We do not carry specific biological or hazardous waste insurance coverage and our property casualty and general liability insurance policies specifically exclude coverage for damages and fines arising from biological or hazardous waste exposure or contamination Accordingly in the event of 88 Table of Contents contamination or injury we could be held liable for damages or be penalized with fines in an amount exceeding our resources and our clinical trials or regulatory approvals could be suspended Any contamination in our third parties manufacturing process shortages of raw materials labor or reagents or failure of any of our key suppliers to deliver necessary components of our platform could result in delays in our clinical development or marketing schedules Given the nature of biologics manufacturing there is a risk of contamination Any contamination could materially adversely affect our or our thirdparty vendors ability to produce our gene therapies on schedule and could therefore harm our results of operations and cause reputational damage The raw materials required in our thirdparty vendors manufacturing processes are derived from biological sources We cannot assure you that our thirdparty vendors have or will be able to obtain on commercially reasonable terms or at all sufficient rights to these materials derived from biological sources Such raw materials are difficult to procure and may also be subject to contamination or recall A material shortage contamination recall or restriction on the use of biologically derived substances in the manufacture of our product candidates could adversely impact or disrupt the clinical and commercial manufacturing of our product candidates which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and development timelines We rely on thirdparty suppliers for the supply and manufacture of certain components of our technology Should our ability to procure these material components from our suppliers be compromised our ability to continuously operate would be impaired until an alternative supplier is sourced qualified and tested which could limit our ability to produce a clinical and commercial supply of our product candidates and harm our business We depend on thirdparty suppliers for materials used in the manufacture of our product candidates and the loss of these thirdparty suppliers or their inability to supply us with adequate materials could harm our business We rely on thirdparty suppliers for certain materials and components required for the production of our product candidates including the materials used to administer our product candidates Our dependence on these thirdparty suppliers and the challenges we may face in obtaining adequate supplies of materials involve several risks including limited control over pricing availability and quality and delivery schedules There is substantial demand and limited supply for certain of the raw materials used to manufacture gene therapy products As a small company our negotiation leverage is limited and we are likely to get lower priority than our competitors that are larger than we are We cannot be certain that our suppliers will continue to provide us with the quantities of these raw materials that we require or satisfy our anticipated specifications and quality requirements Any supply interruption in limited or sole sourced raw materials could materially harm our ability to manufacture our product candidates until a new source of supply if any could be identified and qualified We may be unable to find a sufficient alternative supply channel in a reasonable time or on commercially reasonable terms Any performance failure on the part of our suppliers could delay the development and potential commercialization of our product candidates including limiting supplies necessary for clinical trials and regulatory approvals which would have a material adverse effect on our business Risks Related to Commercialization We face significant competition in an environment of rapid technological change and the possibility that our competitors may achieve regulatory approval before us or develop therapies or technologies that are more advanced or effective than ours which may harm our business and financial condition and our ability to successfully market or commercialize our product candidates The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries including the genetic medicines field are characterized by rapidly changing technologies competition and a strong emphasis on intellectual property We are aware of several companies focused on developing gene therapies in various indications as well as several companies addressing methods for modifying genes and regulating gene expression We may also face competition from large and specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies academic research institutions government agencies and public and private research institutions 89 Table of Contents For the treatment of GM1 there are no approved diseasemodifying therapies We consider our most direct competitors with respect to PBGM01 for the treatment of GM1 to be Sio Gene Therapies Inc which according to Clinicaltrialsgov began its clinical trial for a gene therapy treatment for early and late infantilejuvenile GM1 in August 2019 and Lysogene SA which has initiated a natural history study and received IND clearance from FDA in February 2021 to start a Phase 1 clinical trial for a gene therapy treatment for GM1 For the treatment of FTD there are no approved diseasemodifying therapies We consider our most direct competitors with respect to PBFT02 for the treatment of FTDGRN to be Alector Inc which is conducting a Phase 2 clinical trial for immuneneurology treatment for FTDGRN and Prevail Therapeutics Inc which has initiated a Phase 12 clinical trial for a gene therapy treatment for FTDGRN Alkermes plc and Arkuda Therapeutics Inc are conducting preclinical research using small molecule approaches to treat FTDGRN patients Denali Therapeutics has a preclinical recombinant progranulin protein under evaluation in addition to their oral EIF2a modulator in a Phase 1 clinical trial We are also aware of other therapeutic approaches in preclinical development that may target FTDGRN patients Recently Forge Biologics announced that FDA granted IND clearance for a Krabbe gene therapy candidate that combines bone marrow transplant and gene therapy There is some evidence that hematopoetic stem cell transplant is beneficial for presymptomatic infants with Krabbe disease and it has become standard of care in many sites in the US We are also aware of other therapeutic approaches in preclinical development and an ongoing natural history study being conducted by the Childrens Hospital of Pittsburgh and certain academic studies for Krabbe disease Many of our potential competitors alone or with their strategic partners have substantially greater financial technical and other resources than we do such as larger research and development clinical marketing and manufacturing organizations Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of competitors Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer more effective have fewer or less severe side effects are more convenient or are less expensive than any product candidates that we may develop Competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market if ever Additionally new or advanced technologies developed by our competitors may render our current or future product candidates uneconomical or obsolete and we may not be successful in marketing our product candidates against competitors The commercial success of any of our product candidates will depend upon its degree of market acceptance by physicians patients thirdparty payors and others in the medical community Ethical social and legal concerns about gene therapy could result in additional regulations restricting or prohibiting our products Even with the requisite approvals from the FDA in the United States and other regulatory authorities internationally the commercial success of our product candidates will depend in part on the acceptance of physicians patients and health care payors of gene therapy products in general and our product candidates in particular as medically necessary costeffective and safe Any product that we commercialize may not gain acceptance by physicians patients health care payors and others in the medical community If these products do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance we may not generate significant product revenue and may not become profitable The degree of market acceptance of gene therapy products and in particular our product candidates if approved for commercial sale will depend on several factors including  the efficacy durability and safety of such product candidates as demonstrated in clinical trials  the potential and perceived advantages of product candidates over alternative treatments  the cost of treatment relative to alternative treatments  the clinical indications for which the product candidate is approved by the FDA or exUS regulatory authorities  the willingness of physicians to prescribe new therapies and use ICM administration  our ability to successfully train neurosurgeons and interventional radiologists in ICM administration of our product candidates  the willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies 90 Table of Contents  the prevalence and severity of any side effects  product labeling or product insert requirements of the FDA or exUS regulatory authorities including any limitations or warnings contained in a products approved labeling  relative convenience and ease of administration  the strength of marketing and distribution support  the timing of market introduction of competitive products  publicity concerning our products or competing products and treatments and  sufficient thirdparty payor coverage and adequate reimbursement and patients willingness to pay outofpocket in the absence of such coverage and adequate reimbursement  Even if a potential product displays a favorable efficacy and safety profile in preclinical studies and clinical trials market acceptance of the product will not be fully known until after it is launched If in the future we are unable to establish US or global sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to sell and market our product candidates we may not be successful in commercializing our product candidates if they are approved and we may not be able to generate any revenue We currently do not have a marketing or sales team for the marketing sales and distribution of any of our product candidates that may receive regulatory approval In order to commercialize any product candidates after approval we must build on a territorybyterritory basis marketing sales distribution managerial and other nontechnical capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services and we may not be successful in doing so If our product candidates receive regulatory approval we may decide to establish an internal sales or marketing team with technical expertise and supporting distribution capabilities to commercialize our product candidates which will be expensive and timeconsuming and will require significant attention of our executive officers to manage Any failure or delay in the development of our internal sales marketing and distribution capabilities would adversely impact the commercialization of any of our product candidates that we obtain approval to market With respect to the commercialization of all or certain of our product candidates we may choose to collaborate either globally or on a territorybyterritory basis with third parties that have direct sales forces and established distribution systems either to augment our own sales force and distribution systems or in lieu of our own sales force and distribution systems If we are unable to enter into such arrangements when needed on acceptable terms or at all we may not be able to successfully commercialize any of our product candidates that receive regulatory approval or any such commercialization may experience delays or limitations If we are not successful in commercializing our product candidates either on our own or through collaborations with one or more third parties our future product revenue will suffer and we may incur significant additional losses We may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular product candidate or indication and fail to capitalize on product candidates or indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success Because we have limited financial and managerial resources we focus on research programs and product candidates that we identify for specific indications As a result we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates or for other indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to timely capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities Our spending on current and future research and development programs and product candidates for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable products The development of our three lead product candidates and four ongoing research programs require significant resources If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through collaboration licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such product candidate 91 Table of Contents Risks Related to Intellectual Property If we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection or other necessary rights for our products and technology or if the scope of the patent protection obtained is not sufficiently broad or our rights under licensed patents is not sufficiently broad our competitors could develop and commercialize products and technology similar or identical to ours and our ability to successfully commercialize our products and technology may be adversely affected Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary or intellectual property protection in the United States and other countries for our current product candidates and future products as well as our core technologies including our manufacturing knowhow We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology inventions and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business by seeking maintaining and defending our intellectual property whether developed internally or licensed from third parties We also rely on trade secrets knowhow continuing technological innovation and inlicensing opportunities to develop strengthen and maintain our proprietary position in the field of gene therapy Additionally we intend to rely on regulatory protection afforded through rare drug designations data exclusivity and market exclusivity as well as patent term extensions where available Currently our intellectual property protection consists solely of patent applications that we have inlicensed from Penn under the Penn Agreement The inlicensed patent applications are directed to certain new AAV capsids to recombinant AAV viruses or rAAV capable of delivering certain genes into human cells to treat monogenic disorders of the CNS to methods of treating those monogenic diseases with rAAV as well as to certain aspects of our manufacturing capabilities and related technologies We also have options under the Penn Agreement to add additional intellectual property to our existing license To date we have exercised two options one with respect to CharcotMarie Tooth disease and another for an undisclosed CNS target The patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain involves complex legal and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation The degree of patent protection we require to successfully compete in the marketplace may be unavailable or severely limited in some cases and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage We cannot provide any assurances that any of our licensed patent applications will mature into issued patents and cannot provide any assurances that any such patents if issued will include claims with a scope sufficient to protect our current and future product candidates or otherwise provide any competitive advantage Additionally patents can be enforced only in those jurisdictions in which the patent has issued Furthermore patents have a limited lifespan In the United States the natural expiration of a patent is generally twenty years after its first nonprovisional US filing The natural expiration of a patent outside of the United States varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law but is generally 20 years from the earliest local filing date Various extensions may be available however the life of a patent and the protection it affords is limited Given the amount of time required for the development testing and regulatory review of new product candidates patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized Moreover our exclusive license is subject to field restrictions and retained rights which may adversely impact our competitive position Our licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with adequate and continuing patent protection sufficient to exclude others from commercializing products similar to our product candidates including biosimilar versions of such products In addition the patent portfolio licensed to us is or may be licensed to third parties outside our licensed field and such third parties may have certain enforcement rights Thus patents licensed to us could be put at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly in litigation filed by or against another licensee or in administrative proceedings brought by or against another licensee in response to such litigation or for other reasons Other parties have developed technologies that may be related or competitive to our own and such parties may have filed or may file patent applications or may have received or may receive patents claiming inventions that may overlap or conflict with those claimed in our own patent applications or issued patents Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries and patent applications in the United States and in other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing or in some cases not at all Therefore we cannot know with 92 Table of Contents certainty whether the inventors of our licensed patents and applications were the first to make the inventions claimed in those patents or pending patent applications or that they were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions Further we cannot assure you that all of the potentially relevant prior art relating to our licensed patents and patent applications has been found If such prior art exists it can invalidate a patent or prevent a patent from issuing from a pending patent application As a result the issuance scope validity and commercial value of our patent rights cannot be predicted with any certainty Further if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is threatened regardless of the outcome it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license develop or commercialize current or future product candidates In addition the patent prosecution process is expensive and timeconsuming and we or our licensors may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner In addition the scope of the claims initially submitted for examination may be significantly narrowed by the time they issue if at all It is also possible that we or our licensors will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to pursue or obtain additional patent protection based on our research and development efforts or that any such patents or other intellectual property we generate will provide any competitive advantage Moreover we do not have the right to control the preparation filing and prosecution of patent applications or to control the maintenance of the patents covering technology that we license from third parties Therefore these patents and applications may not be filed prosecuted or maintained in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business Even if we acquire patent protection that we expect should enable us to maintain competitive advantage the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship scope validity or enforceability Third parties including competitors may challenge the inventorship scope validity or enforceability thereof which may result in such patents being narrowed invalidated or held unenforceable If issued our licensed patents may be challenged in patent offices in the United States and abroad or in court For example we may be subject to a thirdparty submission of prior art to the US Patent and Trademark Office or USPTO challenging the validity of one or more claims of our licensed patents once issued Such submissions may also be made prior to a patents issuance precluding the granting of a patent based on one of our pending licensed patent applications We may become involved in opposition reexamination inter partes review postgrant review derivation interference or similar proceedings in the United States or abroad challenging the claims of patents that we have licensed once issued Furthermore patents that we have licensed may be challenged in court once issued Competitors may claim that they invented the inventions claimed in such patents or patent applications prior to the inventors of our licensed patents or may have filed patent applications before the inventors of our licensed patents did A competitor may also claim that we are infringing its patents and that we therefore cannot practice our technology as claimed under our licensed patent applications and patents if issued As a result one or more claims of our licensed patents may be narrowed or invalidated In litigation a competitor could claim that our patents if issued are not valid for a number of reasons If a court agrees we would lose our rights to those challenged patents Even if they are unchallenged our licensed patents and pending patent applications if issued may not provide us with any meaningful protection or prevent competitors from designing around our patent claims to circumvent our licensed patents by developing similar or alternative technologies or therapeutics in a noninfringing manner For example even if we have a valid and enforceable patent we may not be able to exclude others from practicing our invention if the other party can show that they used the invention in commerce before our filing date or the other party benefits from a compulsory license Moreover a third party may develop a competitive product that provides benefits similar to one or more of our product candidates but that uses a vector or an expression construct that falls outside the scope of our patent protection or license rights If the patent protection provided by the patents and patent applications we hold or pursue with respect to our product candidates is not sufficiently broad to impede such competition our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates could be negatively affected which would harm our business Although currently all of our patent applications are inlicensed similar risks would apply to any patents or patent applications that we may own or inlicense in the future In addition to patent protection if any of our product candidates are approved by the FDA as a biological product under a BLA in the United States we believe the product would qualify for a 12year period of exclusivity Other regulatory exclusivities may be available such as Orphan Drug exclusivity with analogous data marketing and orphan 93 Table of Contents exclusivities in various foreign countries However the scope of such regulatory exclusivities is subject to change and may not provide us with adequate and continuing protection sufficient to exclude others from commercializing products similar to our product candidates All of our current product candidates and research programs are licensed from or based upon licenses from a third party and are field limited to certain indications If this license agreement is terminated or interpreted to narrow our rights our ability to advance our current product candidates or develop new product candidates based on these technologies will be materially adversely affected We now depend on Penn and will continue to depend on Penn and on licenses and sublicenses from other third parties as well as potentially on other strategic relationships with third parties for the research development manufacturing and commercialization of our current product candidates If any of our licenses or relationships or any inlicenses on which our licenses are based are terminated or breached we may  lose our rights to develop and market our current product candidates  lose patent or trade secret protection for our current product candidates  experience significant delays in the development or commercialization of our current product candidates  not be able to obtain any other licenses on acceptable terms if at all or  incur liability for damages  Additionally even if not terminated or breached our intellectual property licenses or sublicenses may be subject to disagreements over contract interpretation which could narrow the scope of our rights to the relevant intellectual property or technology or increase our financial or other obligations If we experience any of the foregoing it could have a materially adverse effect on our business and could force us to cease operations which could cause you to lose all of your investment If we breach our license agreements it could have a material adverse effect on our commercialization efforts for our product candidates If we breach any of the agreements under which we license the use development and commercialization rights to our product candidates or technology from third parties we could lose license rights that are important to our business Our current lead product candidates and pipeline are and our anticipated near term pipeline will be licensed from Penn Under the Penn Agreement we are subject to various obligations including diligence obligations such as development and commercialization obligations as well as potential royalty payments and other obligations If we fail to comply with any of these obligations or otherwise breach our license agreements our licensors may have the right to terminate the applicable license in whole or in part Generally the loss of any one of our current licenses or any other license we may acquire in the future could harm our business prospects financial condition and results of operations Licensing of intellectual property is of critical importance to our business and involves complex legal business and scientific issues Disputes may arise between us and our licensors regarding intellectual property subject to a license agreement including  the scope of rights granted under the license agreement and other interpretationrelated issues  whether and the extent to which our technology and processes infringe on intellectual property of the licensor that is not subject to the licensing agreement  our right to sublicense patent and other intellectual property rights to third parties under collaborative development relationships  our diligence obligations with respect to the use of the licensed technology in relation to our development and commercialization of our product candidates and what activities satisfy those diligence obligations  the ownership of inventions and knowhow resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by our licensors and us and our partners and 94 Table of Contents  whether and the extent to which inventors are able to contest the assignment of their rights to our licensors  If disputes over intellectual property that we have licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current licensing arrangements on acceptable terms or at all we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the affected product candidates In addition if disputes arise as to ownership of licensed intellectual property our ability to pursue or enforce the licensed patent rights may be jeopardized If we or our licensors fail to adequately protect this intellectual property our ability to commercialize our products could suffer Our strategy of obtaining rights to key technologies through inlicenses may not be successful We seek to expand our product candidate pipeline in part by inlicensing the rights to key technologies The future growth of our business will depend in part on our ability to inlicense or otherwise acquire the rights to additional product candidates or technologies We cannot assure you that we will be able to inlicense or acquire the rights to any product candidates or technologies from third parties on acceptable terms or at all The inlicensing and acquisition of these technologies is a competitive area and a number of more established companies are also pursuing strategies to license or acquire product candidates or technologies that we may consider attractive These established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size cash resources and greater clinical development and commercialization capabilities In addition companies that perceive us to be a competitor may be unwilling to license rights to us Furthermore we may be unable to identify suitable product candidates or technologies within our area of focus If we are unable to successfully obtain rights to suitable product candidates or technologies our business financial condition and prospects could suffer Third parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging claims of intellectual property infringement the outcome of which would be uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business Our commercial success depends upon our ability and the ability of our collaborators to develop manufacture market and sell our product candidates and future products and use our proprietary technologies without infringing the proprietary rights and intellectual property of third parties The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by extensive and frequent litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights We may in the future become party to or threatened with adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our product candidates future products and technology Our competitors or other third parties may assert infringement or misappropriation claims against us alleging that our therapeutics manufacturing methods formulations or administration methods are covered by their patents Numerous US and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications which are owned by third parties exist in the fields in which we are pursuing product candidates For example in connection with our formation we were indirectly informed of claims that third parties may potentially raise against us or our collaborators regarding our AAVhu68 capsid We believe that we would have valid defenses to these and any other such claims however if any such claims were ultimately successful we might require a license to continue to use and sell any product candidates using such AAV vector Such licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all On February 18 2020 we received a letter from Regenxbio Inc or Regenx which stated its view that the use of our AAVhu68 capsid infringes patent claims to which Regenx has an exclusive license and which expire in 2024 Regenx also stated that it has exclusive licenses to various pending patent applications regarding the use of AAV vectors administered via ICM and that these applications may lead to issued claims that Regenx believes may if issued cover our planned method of administration for our lead product candidates We believe we have valid defenses to the issued claims set forth by Regenx relating to AAVhu68 Further the prosecution of pending patent applications is highly uncertain and it is unclear whether any patents will issue from these pending Regenx patent applications at all much less with claims that are relevant to the administration of our product candidates Regenx also asked for information regarding our relationship with Dr Wilson while he was serving as an advisor to Regenx Regenxs letter also offers to discuss licensing the applicable patent portfolios from them In April 2020 we responded to Regenx indicating that we do not believe we require a license to any of the specified Regenx patents or patent applications at this time and that we found that Dr Wilsons relationship with us was consistent with his obligations to Regenx We will continue to monitor the situation and if necessary take appropriate actions which may include responding to further correspondence from 95 Table of Contents Regenx and engaging in discussions with Regenx regarding their claims If any such patents were enforceable and such claims were ultimately successful we might require a license to continue to use and sell any product candidates using such AAV vector Further we do not know which processes we will use for commercial manufacture of our future products or which technologies owned or controlled by third parties may prove important or essential to those processes Given the vast number of patents in our field of technology we cannot be certain or guarantee that we do not or will not infringe existing patents or that we will not infringe patents that may be granted in the future Many companies have filed and continue to file patent applications related to gene therapy and orphan diseases Some of these patent applications have already been allowed or issued and others may issue in the future Since this area is competitive and of strong interest to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies there will likely be additional patent applications filed and additional patents granted in the future as well as additional research and development programs expected in the future Furthermore because patent applications can take many years to issue may be confidential for 18 months or more after filing and can be revised before issuance there may be applications now pending which may later result in issued patents that may be infringed by the manufacture use sale or importation of our product candidates or future products If a patent holder believes the manufacture use sale offer for sale or importation of one of our product candidates or future products infringes its patent the patent holder may sue us even if we have licensed other patent protection for our technology Moreover we may face patent infringement claims from nonpracticing entities that have no relevant product revenue and against whom our licensed patent portfolio may therefore have no deterrent effect It is also possible that we have failed to identify relevant thirdparty patents or applications For example applications filed before November 29 2000 and certain applications filed after that date that will not be filed outside the United States remain confidential until patents issue Moreover it is difficult for industry participants including us to identify all thirdparty patent rights that may be relevant to our product candidates and technologies because patent searching is imperfect due to differences in terminology among patents incomplete databases and the difficulty in assessing the meaning of patent claims We may fail to identify relevant patents or patent applications or may identify pending patent applications of potential interest but incorrectly predict the likelihood that such patent applications may issue with claims of relevance to our technology In addition we may be unaware of one or more issued patents that would be infringed by the manufacture sale importation or use of a current or future product candidate or we may incorrectly conclude that a thirdparty patent is invalid unenforceable or not infringed by our activities Additionally pending patent applications that have been published can subject to certain limitations be later amended in a manner that could cover our technologies our future products or the manufacture or use of our future products Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing intellectual property rights and intellectual property rights that may be granted in the future If we were to challenge the validity of an issued US patent in court such as an issued US patent of potential relevance to some of our product candidates or future products or manufacture or methods of use we would need to overcome a statutory presumption of validity that attaches to every US patent This means that in order to prevail we would have to present clear and convincing evidence as to the invalidity of the patents claims There is no assurance that a court would find in our favor on questions of infringement or validity Patent and other types of intellectual property litigation can involve complex factual and legal questions and their outcome is uncertain If we are found or believe there is a risk we may be found to infringe a third partys intellectual property rights we could be required or may choose to obtain a license from such third party to continue developing and marketing our products and technology However we may not be able to obtain any such license on commercially reasonable terms or at all Even if we were able to obtain a license it could be nonexclusive thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us Without such a license we could be forced including by court order to cease commercializing the infringing technology or product In addition we could be found liable for monetary damages including treble damages and attorneys fees if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our future products or force us to cease some of our business operations which could materially harm our business Alternatively we may need to redesign our infringing products which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure If we lose a foreign patent lawsuit alleging our infringement of a competitors patents we could be prevented from marketing our therapeutics in one or more foreign countries andor be required to pay monetary damages for infringement or royalties in order to continue marketing Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information trade secrets or other intellectual 96 Table of Contents property of third parties could have a similar negative impact on our business Any of these outcomes would have a materially adverse effect on our business Even if we are successful in these proceedings we may incur substantial costs and divert management time and attention in pursuing these proceedings which could have a material adverse effect on us If we are unable to avoid infringing the patent rights of others we may be required to seek a license defend an infringement action or challenge the validity of the patents in court or redesign our future products or processes Patent litigation is costly and timeconsuming and some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources We may not have sufficient resources to bring these actions to a successful conclusion Furthermore because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation or administrative proceedings there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could delay our research and development efforts adversely affect our ability to raise additional funds and could limit our ability to continue our operations If we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets our business and competitive position may be harmed In addition to the protection afforded by patents we rely upon unpatented trade secret protection unpatented knowhow and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes in part by entering into confidentiality agreements with our contractors collaborators scientific advisors employees and consultants and invention assignment agreements with our consultants and employees We may not be able to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical knowhow or other trade secrets by the parties to these agreements however despite the existence generally of confidentiality agreements and other contractual restrictions Monitoring unauthorized uses and disclosures is difficult and we do not know whether the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary technologies will be effective If any of the contractors collaborators scientific advisors employees and consultants who are parties to these agreements breaches or violates the terms of any of these agreements we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach or violation As a result we could lose our trade secrets Enforcing a claim that a third party illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets like patent litigation is expensive and time consuming and the outcome is unpredictable In addition courts outside the United States are sometimes less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets Our trade secrets could otherwise become known or be independently discovered by our competitors Competitors could purchase our product candidates and attempt to replicate some or all of the competitive advantages we derive from our development efforts willfully infringe our intellectual property rights design around our protected technology or develop their own competitive technologies that fall outside of our intellectual property rights If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor we would have no right to prevent them or those to whom they communicate it from using that technology or information to compete with us If our trade secrets are not adequately protected or sufficient to provide an advantage over our competitors our competitive position could be adversely affected as could our business Additionally if the steps taken to maintain our trade secrets are deemed inadequate we may have insufficient recourse against third parties for misappropriating our trade secrets Obtaining and maintaining patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural document submission fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for noncompliance with these requirements The USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural documentary fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process In addition periodic maintenance fees on issued patents often must be paid to the USPTO and foreign patent agencies over the lifetime of the patent While an unintentional lapse can in many cases be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules there are situations in which noncompliance can result in premature abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction Noncompliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application include but are not limited to failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits nonpayment of fees and failure 97 Table of Contents to properly legalize and submit formal documents If we or our licensors fail to maintain the patents and patent applications covering our product candidates we may not be able to stop a competitor from marketing drugs that are the same as or similar to our product candidates which would have a material adverse effect on our business We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world Filing prosecuting and defending patents on product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States The requirements for patentability may differ in certain countries particularly in developing countries Moreover our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights may be adversely affected by unforeseen changes in foreign intellectual property laws In addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States Further licensing partners may not prosecute patents in certain jurisdictions in which we may obtain commercial rights thereby precluding the possibility of later obtaining patent protection in these countries Consequently we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and may also export infringing products to territories where we have patent protection but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States These products may compete with our products and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing Our inlicensed patent family drawn to AAVhu68 capsids is pending in major pharmaceutical markets including the United States Canada Europe Japan Korea and China as well as in other jurisdictions we will not be able to enforce the patent in any jurisdictions in which the application has not been filed Filing prosecuting and defending patents on product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive and we or our licensor may be unable to predict and may fail to seek patent protection in jurisdictions in which protection may ultimately be desired Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions The legal systems of certain countries particularly certain developing countries do not favor the enforcement of patents trade secrets and other intellectual property protection particularly those relating to biotechnology products which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally For example many foreign countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner must grant licenses to third parties Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions whether or not successful could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded if any may not be commercially meaningful Accordingly our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license We may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or other intellectual property which could be expensive time consuming and unsuccessful Competitors may infringe our patents trademarks copyrights or other intellectual property To counter infringement or unauthorized use we may be required to file infringement claims which can be expensive and time consuming and divert the time and attention of our management and scientific personnel Any claims we assert against perceived infringers could provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us alleging that we infringe their patents in addition to counterclaims asserting that our patents are invalid or unenforceable or both The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable In any patent infringement proceeding there is a risk that a court will decide that a patent of ours is invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part and that we do not have the right to stop the other party from using the invention at issue There is also a risk that even if the validity of such patents is upheld the court will construe the patents claims narrowly or decide that we do not have the right to stop the other party from using the invention at issue on the grounds that our patent claims do not cover the invention An adverse outcome in a litigation or proceeding involving our patents could limit our ability to assert our patents against those parties or other competitors and may curtail or preclude our ability to exclude third parties from making and selling similar or 98 Table of Contents competitive products Any of these occurrences could adversely affect our competitive business position business prospects and financial condition Similarly if we assert trademark infringement claims a court may determine that the marks we have asserted are invalid or unenforceable or that the party against whom we have asserted trademark infringement has superior rights to the marks in question In this case we could ultimately be forced to cease use of such trademarks Even if we establish infringement the court may decide not to grant an injunction against further infringing activity and instead award only monetary damages which may or may not be an adequate remedy Furthermore because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during litigation There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings motions or other interim proceedings or developments If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative it could have a material adverse effect on the price of shares of our common stock Moreover there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient financial or other resources to file and pursue such infringement claims which typically last for years before they are concluded Even if we ultimately prevail in such claims the monetary cost of such litigation and the diversion of the attention of our management and scientific personnel could outweigh any benefit we receive as a result of the proceedings Changes in patent law in the United States and in nonUS jurisdictions could diminish the value of patents in general thereby impairing our ability to protect our product candidates As is the case with other biotechnology companies our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property particularly patents Obtaining and enforcing patents in the biotechnology industry involve both technological and legal complexity and is therefore costly timeconsuming and inherently uncertain Past or future patent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents For example in March 2013 under the LeahySmith America Invents Act or America Invents Act the United States moved from a first to invent to a firstinventortofile patent system Under a firstinventortofile system assuming the other requirements for patentability are met the first inventor to file a patent application generally will be entitled to a patent on the invention regardless of whether another inventor had made the invention earlier The America Invents Act includes a number of other significant changes to US patent law including provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted redefine prior art and establish a new postgrant review system The effects of these changes are currently unclear as the USPTO continues to promulgate new regulations and procedures in connection with the America Invents Act and many of the substantive changes to patent law including the firstinventortofile provisions only became effective in March 2013 In addition the courts have yet to address many of these provisions and the applicability of the act and new regulations on the specific patents discussed in this filing have not been determined and would need to be reviewed However the America Invents Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents Additionally recent US Supreme Court rulings have narrowed the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances and weakened the rights of patent owners in certain situations In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents once obtained Depending on decisions by the US Congress the federal courts and the USPTO the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future For example in the case Assoc for Molecular Pathology v Myriad Genetics Inc the US Supreme Court held that certain claims to DNA molecules are not eligible for patent protection We cannot predict how future decisions by the courts the US Congress or the USPTO may impact the value of our patents Any similar adverse changes in the patent laws of other jurisdictions could also have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 99 Table of Contents We may be subject to claims asserting that our employees consultants advisors or collaborators have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their current or former employers or claims asserting ownership of or other rights to what we regard as our own or licensed intellectual property Many of our employees consultants or advisors and the employees consultants or advisors of our licensors are currently or were previously employed at or affiliated with universities hospitals or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies including our competitors or potential competitors Although we try to ensure that our employees consultants and advisors do not use the proprietary information or knowhow of others in their work for us we may be subject to claims that these individuals or we have used or disclosed intellectual property including trade secrets or other proprietary information of any such individuals current or former employer Moreover some of our licensors and our or our licensors employees consultants or advisors are or have been affiliated or have a contractual relationship with multiple institutions and companies including our competitors and may have or have had an obligation to them Such institutions and companies could challenge our license rights or our licensors intellectual property ownership rights Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims and we may be obligated to indemnify our employees consultants advisors or collaborators in certain instances If we fail in defending any such claims in addition to paying monetary damages we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel Even if we are successful in defending against such claims litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management In addition while it is our policy to require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the conception or development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who in fact conceives or develops intellectual property that we regard as our own The assignment of intellectual property rights may not be selfexecuting or the assignment agreements may be breached and we may be forced to bring claims against third parties or defend claims that they may bring against us to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property Patent terms may be inadequate to protect our competitive position on our product candidates for an adequate amount of time Patents have a limited lifespan In the United States if all maintenance fees are timely paid the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years from its earliest US nonprovisional filing date Various extensions may be available but the life of a patent and the protection it affords is limited Even if patents covering our product candidates are obtained once the patent life has expired we may be open to competition from competitive products including generics Given the amount of time required for the development testing and regulatory review of new product candidates patents protecting our product candidates might expire before or shortly after we or our partners commercialize those candidates As a result our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours If we do not obtain patent term extension for any product candidates we may develop our business may be materially harmed Depending upon the timing duration and specifics of any FDA marketing approval of any product candidates we may develop one or more of our US patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 or the HatchWaxman Amendments The HatchWaxman Amendments permit a patent extension term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval only one patent per product may be extended and only those claims covering the approved drug a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended However even if we were to seek a patent term extension it may not be granted because of for example the failure to exercise due diligence during the testing phase or regulatory review process the failure to apply within applicable deadlines the failure to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or any other failure to satisfy applicable requirements Moreover the applicable time period or the scope of patent protection afforded could be less than we request If we are unable to obtain patent term extension or term of any such extension is less than we request our competitors may obtain approval of competing products following our patent expiration and our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be materially harmed 100 Table of Contents Some intellectual property that we have inlicensed may have been discovered through government funded programs and thus may be subject to federal regulations such as marchin rights certain reporting requirements and a preference for USbased companies Compliance with such regulations may limit our exclusive rights and limit our ability to contract with nonUS manufacturers Many of the intellectual property rights we have licensed are generated through the use of US government funding and are therefore subject to certain federal regulations As a result the US government may have certain rights to intellectual property embodied in our current or future product candidates pursuant to the BayhDole Act of 1980 or BayhDole Act and implementing regulations These US government rights in certain inventions developed under a governmentfunded program include a nonexclusive nontransferable irrevocable worldwide license to use inventions for any governmental purpose In addition the US government has the right to require us or our licensors to grant exclusive partially exclusive or nonexclusive licenses to any of these inventions to a third party if it determines that i adequate steps have not been taken to commercialize the invention ii government action is necessary to meet public health or safety needs or iii government action is necessary to meet requirements for public use under federal regulations also referred to as marchin rights The US government also has the right to take title to these inventions if we or the applicable licensor fail to disclose the invention to the government and fail to file an application to register the intellectual property within specified time limits These time limits have recently been changed by regulation and may change in the future Intellectual property generated under a government funded program is also subject to certain reporting requirements compliance with which may require us or the applicable licensor to expend substantial resources In addition the US government requires that any products embodying the subject invention or produced through the use of the subject invention be manufactured substantially in the United States The manufacturing preference requirement can be waived if the owner of the intellectual property can show that reasonable but unsuccessful efforts have been made to grant licenses on similar terms to potential licensees that would be likely to manufacture substantially in the United States or that under the circumstances domestic manufacture is not commercially feasible This preference for US manufacturers may limit our ability to contract with nonUS product manufacturers for products covered by such intellectual property To the extent any of our current or future intellectual property is generated through the use of US government funding the provisions of the BayhDole Act may similarly apply Risks Related to Government Regulation The pricing insurance coverage and reimbursement status of newly approved products is uncertain Failure to obtain or maintain adequate coverage and reimbursement for our product candidates if approved could limit our ability to market those products and decrease our ability to generate product revenue Our lead product target indications are indications with small patient populations In order for products that are designed to treat smaller patient populations to be commercially viable the reimbursement for such products must be higher on a relative basis to account for the lack of volume Accordingly we will need to implement a coverage and reimbursement strategy for any approved product candidate that accounts for the smaller potential market size If we are unable to establish or sustain coverage and adequate reimbursement for any future product candidates from thirdparty payors the adoption of those products and sales revenue will be adversely affected which in turn could adversely affect the ability to market or sell those product candidates if approved We expect the cost of a single administration of gene therapy products such as those we are developing to be substantial when and if they achieve regulatory approval Therefore we expect that coverage and reimbursement by government and private payors will be essential for most patients to be able to afford these treatments Accordingly sales of any of our product candidates will depend substantially both domestically and internationally on the extent to which the costs of our product candidates will be paid by health maintenance managed care pharmacy benefit and similar healthcare management organizations or will be reimbursed by government authorities private health coverage insurers and other thirdparty payors Even if coverage is provided the approved reimbursement amount may not be high enough to allow us to establish or maintain pricing sufficient to realize a sufficient return on our investment There is significant uncertainty related to the insurance coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products In the United States the principal decisions about reimbursement for new products are typically made by the Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services or CMS an agency within the US Department of Health and Human Services since 101 Table of Contents CMS decides whether and to what extent a new product will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare Private payors tend to follow CMS to a substantial degree However one payors determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug product Further a payors decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved It is difficult to predict what CMS will decide with respect to reimbursement for novel products such as ours since there is no body of established practices and precedents for these new products Reimbursement agencies in Europe may be more conservative than CMS Outside the United States international operations are generally subject to extensive governmental price controls and other market regulations and we believe the increasing emphasis on costcontainment initiatives in Europe Canada and other countries has and will continue to put pressure on the pricing and usage of therapeutics such as our product candidates In many countries particularly the countries of the EU the prices of medical products are subject to varying price control mechanisms as part of national health systems In these countries pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the costeffectiveness of our product candidate to other available therapies In general the prices of products under such systems are substantially lower than in the United States Other countries allow companies to fix their own prices for products but monitor and control company profits Additional foreign price controls or other changes in pricing regulation could restrict the amount that we are able to charge for our product candidates Accordingly in markets outside the United States the reimbursement for our product candidates may be reduced compared with the United States and may be insufficient to generate commercially reasonable revenues and profits Moreover increasing efforts by governmental and thirdparty payors in the United States and internationally to cap or reduce healthcare costs may cause such organizations to limit both coverage and level of reimbursement for new products approved and as a result they may not cover or provide adequate payment for our product candidates We expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of any of our product candidates due to the trend toward managed healthcare the increasing influence of certain thirdparty payors such as health maintenance organizations and additional legislative changes The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general particularly prescription drugs and surgical procedures and other treatments has become very intense As a result increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products into the healthcare market In addition to CMS and private payors professional organizations such as the American Medical Association can influence decisions about reimbursement for new products by determining standards for care In addition many private payors contract with commercial vendors who sell software that provide guidelines that attempt to limit utilization of and therefore reimbursement for certain products deemed to provide limited benefit to existing alternatives Such organizations may set guidelines that limit reimbursement or utilization of our product candidates Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we or our collaborators receive regulatory approval less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future A Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the FDA even if granted for any of our product candidates may not lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process and it does not increase the likelihood that our product candidates will receive marketing approval We may seek a Breakthrough Therapy Designation for our product candidates if the clinical data support such a designation for one or more product candidates A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug or biologic that is intended alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics to treat a serious or lifethreatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug or biologic in our case may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development For product candidates that have been designated as breakthrough therapies interaction and communication between the FDA and the sponsor of the trial can help to identify the most efficient path for clinical development while minimizing the number of patients placed in ineffective control regimens Biologics designated as breakthrough therapies by the FDA may also be eligible for accelerated approval 102 Table of Contents Designation as a breakthrough therapy is within the discretion of the FDA Accordingly even if we believe one of our product candidates meets the criteria for designation as a breakthrough therapy the FDA may disagree and instead determine not to make such designation In any event the receipt of a Breakthrough Therapy Designation for a product candidate may not result in a faster development process review or approval compared to drugs considered for approval under nonexpedited the FDA review procedures and does not assure ultimate approval by the FDA In addition even if one or more of our product candidates qualify as breakthrough therapies the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification A Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy or RMAT Designation by the FDA even if granted for any of our product candidates may not lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process and it does not increase the likelihood that our product candidates will receive marketing approval We plan to seek RMAT Designations if the clinical data support such a designation for one or more product candidates RMAT Designation is an expedited program for the advancement and approval of regenerative medicine products where preliminary clinical evidence indicates the potential to address unmet medical needs for lifethreatening diseases or conditions Similar to Breakthrough Therapy Designation the RMAT Designation allows companies developing regenerative medicine therapies to work more closely and frequently with the FDA and RMATdesignated products may be eligible for priority review and accelerated approval FDA has confirmed that gene therapies including genetically modified cells that lead to a sustained effect on cells or tissues may meet the definition of a regenerative medicine therapy For product candidates that have received an RMAT Designation interaction and communication between the FDA and the sponsor of the trial can help to identify the most efficient path for clinical development while minimizing the number of patients placed in ineffective control regimens RMAT Designation is within the discretion of the FDA Accordingly even if we believe one of our product candidates meets the criteria for RMAT Designation the FDA may disagree and instead determine not to make such designation In any event the receipt of RMAT Designation for a product candidate may not result in a faster development process review or approval compared to drugs considered for approval under nonexpedited FDA review procedures and does not assure ultimate approval by the FDA In addition even if a product candidate qualifies as an RMAT therapy the FDA may later decide that the product candidate no longer meets the conditions for qualification If we decide to pursue a Fast Track Designation by the FDA it may not lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process We may seek Fast Track Designation for one or more of our product candidates If a drug is intended for the treatment of a serious or lifethreatening condition and the drug demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for this condition the product sponsor may apply for FDA Fast Track Designation The FDA has broad discretion whether or not to grant this designation so even if we believe a particular product candidate is eligible for this designation we cannot assure you that the FDA would decide to grant it Even if we do receive Fast Track Designation we may not experience a faster development process review or approval compared to conventional FDA procedures The FDA may withdraw Fast Track Designation if it believes that the designation is no longer supported by data from our clinical development program If we decide to seek Orphan Drug Designation for some of our product candidates we may be unsuccessful or may be unable to maintain the benefits associated with Orphan Drug Designation including the potential for supplemental market exclusivity We have obtained Orphan Drug Designations for PBGM01 for the treatment of GM1 gangliosidosis for PBFT02 for the treatment of FTDGRN and for PBKR03 for the treatment of Krabbe disease We have sought and may continue to seek Orphan Drug Designation for one or more of our other product candidates and we may be unsuccessful Regulatory authorities in some jurisdictions including the United States and Europe may designate drugs for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs Under the Orphan Drug Act the FDA may designate a drug as an orphan drug if it is a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition which is generally defined as a patient population of fewer than 200000 individuals in the United States or a patient population greater than 200000 in the United States where there is 103 Table of Contents no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing the drug will be recovered from sales in the United States In the United States Orphan Drug Designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as tax advantages and user fee waivers Opportunities for grant funding toward clinical trial costs may also be available for clinical trials of drugs for rare diseases regardless of whether the drugs are designated for the orphan use In addition if a product that has Orphan Drug Designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same product for the same indication for seven years except in limited circumstances For large molecule drugs including gene therapies sameness is determined based on principal molecular structural features of a product As applied to gene therapies the FDA has recently issued draft guidance in which it stated it would consider certain key features such as the transgenes expressed by the gene therapy and the vectors used to deliver the transgene to be principal molecular structural features With regard to vectors the FDA intends to consider whether two vectors from the same viral class are the same or different on a casebycase basis The FDA does not intend to consider minor differences between transgenes and vectors to be different principal molecular structural features The FDA also intends to consider whether additional features of the final gene therapy product such as regulatory elements and the cell type that is transduced for genetically modified cells should also be considered to be principal molecular structural features  Although we have obtained Orphan Drug Designation for our lead product candidates and even if we obtain Orphan Drug Designation for our other product candidates in specific indications we may not be the first to obtain marketing approval of these product candidates for the orphandesignated indication due to the uncertainties associated with developing pharmaceutical products If a competitor with a product that is determined by the FDA to be the same as one of our product candidates obtains marketing approval before us for the same indication we are pursuing and obtains orphan drug exclusivity our product candidate may not be approved until the period of exclusivity ends unless we are able to demonstrate that our product candidate is clinically superior Even after obtaining approval we may be limited in our ability to market our product In addition exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be limited if we seek approval for an indication broader than the orphandesignated indication or may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition Further even if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for a product that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition because different drugs with different principal molecular structural features can be approved for the same condition Even after an orphan product is approved the FDA can subsequently approve the same drug with the same principal molecular structural features for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the later drug is safer more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care Orphan Drug Designation neither shortens the development time or regulatory review time of a drug nor gives the drug any advantage in the regulatory review or approval process In addition while we may seek Orphan Drug Designation for some of our product candidates we may never receive such designations  The recent tax reform legislation which was signed into law on December 22 2017 reduced the amount of the qualified clinical research costs for a designated orphan product that a sponsor may claim as a credit from 50 to 25 Thus further limiting the advantage and may impact our future business strategy of seeking the Orphan Drug Designation  104 Table of Contents Rare Pediatric Disease designation by the FDA for any of our product candidates does not guarantee that the BLA for the product will qualify for a priority review voucher upon approval and it does not lead to a faster development or regulatory review process or increase the likelihood that our product candidates will receive marketing approval Under the Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher program upon the approval of a qualifying BLA for the treatment of a rare pediatric disease the sponsor of such an application would be eligible for a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher that can be used to obtain priority review for a subsequent BLA or NDA If a product candidate is designated before September 30 2024 it is eligible to receive a voucher if it is approved before September 30 2026 While we have obtained Rare Pediatric Disease Designation for PBGM01 for the treatment of GM1 gangliosidosis and PBKR03 for the treatment of Krabbe disease it is uncertain whether either product candidate will be approved by September 30 2026 If approval is not obtained by then we would not be in a position to obtain a priority review voucher unless Congress further reauthorizes the program beyond the current sunset date in September 2024 Additionally designation of a drug for a rare pediatric disease does not guarantee that a BLA will meet the eligibility criteria for a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher at the time the application is approved Finally a Rare Pediatric Disease Designation does not lead to faster development or regulatory review of the product or increase the likelihood that it will receive marketing approvalAny product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval will be subject to extensive postmarketing regulatory requirements and could be subject to postmarketing restrictions or withdrawal from the market and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with our product candidates when and if any of them are approved Our product candidates and the activities associated with their development and potential commercialization including their testing manufacture recordkeeping labeling storage approval advertising promotion sale and distribution are subject to comprehensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory authorities These requirements include submissions of safety and other postmarketing information and reports registration and listing requirements cGMPs requirements relating to manufacturing quality control quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents including periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities and requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians and recordkeeping The FDA may also impose requirements for costly postmarketing studies or clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of any approved product The FDA closely regulates the postapproval marketing and promotion of drugs and biologics to ensure drugs and biologics are marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved product labeling The FDA imposes stringent restrictions on manufacturers communications regarding use of their products If we promote our product candidates beyond their potentially approved indications we may be subject to enforcement action for offlabel promotion Violations of the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act relating to the promotion of prescription drugs may lead to investigations alleging violations of federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws as well as state consumer protection laws In addition later discovery of previously unknown adverse events or other problems with our product candidates manufacturers or manufacturing processes or failure to comply with regulatory requirements may yield various results including  restrictions on such product candidates manufacturers or manufacturing processes  restrictions on the labeling or marketing of a product  restrictions on product distribution or use  requirements to conduct postmarketing studies or clinical trials  warning or untitled letters  withdrawal of any approved product from the market  refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit  recall of product candidates  fines restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenues  suspension or withdrawal of marketing approvals  refusal to permit the import or export of our product candidates  product seizure or 105 Table of Contents  injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties  Noncompliance with European requirements regarding safety monitoring or pharmacovigilance and with requirements related to the development of products for the pediatric population can also result in significant financial penalties Similarly failure to comply with requirements regarding the protection of personal information can also lead to significant penalties and sanctions Our product candidates for which we intend to seek approval may face competition from biosimilars sooner than anticipated The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 or the ACA includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 or BPCIA The BPCIA created an abbreviated pathway for the approval of biosimilar and interchangeable biological products The abbreviated regulatory pathway establishes legal authority for the FDA to review and approve biosimilar biologics including the possible designation of a biosimilar as interchangeable based on its similarity to an existing reference product Under the BPCIA an application for a biosimilar product cannot be approved by the FDA until 12 years after the original branded product is approved under a BLA The law is complex and is still being interpreted and implemented by the FDA As a result its ultimate impact implementation and meaning are subject to uncertainty While it is uncertain when such processes intended to implement BPCIA may be fully adopted by the FDA any such processes could have a material adverse effect on the future commercial prospects for our biological products We believe that if any of our product candidates is approved as a biological product under a BLA it should qualify for the 12year period of exclusivity However there is a risk that the FDA will not consider any of our product candidates to be reference products for competing products potentially creating the opportunity for biosimilar competition sooner than anticipated Additionally this period of regulatory exclusivity does not apply to companies pursuing regulatory approval via their own traditional BLA rather than via the abbreviated pathway Moreover the extent to which a biosimilar once approved will be substituted for any one of our reference products in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for nonbiological products is not yet clear and will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing Finally there has been public discussion of potentially decreasing the period of exclusivity from the current 12 years If such a change were to be enacted our product candidates if approved could have a shorter period of exclusivity than anticipated Litigation challenging the constitutionality of the ACA may affect the BPCIA For example on December 14 2018 a Texas US District Court Judge ruled that the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the individual mandate was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act or the TCJA On December 18 2019 the US Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the District Court ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well On March 2 2020 the United States Supreme Court granted the petitions for writs of certiorari to review this case and oral arguments were held on November 10 2020 although it unclear when a decision will be made or how the Supreme Court will rule There may also be other efforts to challenge repeal or replace the ACA We continue to evaluate the effect that the ACA and its possible repeal and replacement has on our business and exclusivity under the BPCIA It is uncertain the extent to which any such changes may impact our business or financial condition Enacted and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us to obtain marketing approval of and commercialize our product candidates and may affect the prices we may set In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could among other things prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidates restrict or regulate postapproval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell any products for which we obtain marketing approval For example in March 2010 the ACA was enacted to broaden access to health insurance reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending enhance remedies against fraud and abuse add new transparency requirements for health care and health insurance industries impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy 106 Table of Contents reforms As implementation of the ACA is ongoing the law appears likely to continue the downward pressure on pharmaceutical pricing especially under the Medicare program and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs There remain judicial and Congressional challenges as well as efforts by the Trump administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the ACA For example The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 or TCJA includes a provision that repealed effective January 1 2019 the taxbased shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year which is commonly referred to as the individual mandate On December 14 2018 a US District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas or Texas District Court Judge ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the ACA and therefore because it was repealed as part of the TCJA the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well On December 18 2019 the US Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the District Court ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the Affordable Care Act are invalid as well The United States Supreme Court is currently reviewing this case but it is unclear when a decision will be made It is also unclear how such litigation and other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA will impact the ACA Moreover the Drug Supply Chain Security Act imposes new obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products related to product tracking and tracing Legislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand postapproval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products We are not sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted or whether the current regulations guidance or interpretations will be changed or what the impact of such changes on our business if any may be There has been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over pharmaceutical pricing practices in light of the rising cost of prescription drugs and biologics Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent Congressional inquiries executive orders and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to among other things bring more transparency to product pricing review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products In addition state legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product and medical device pricing including price or patient reimbursement constraints discounts restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures and in some cases designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing We are not sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted or whether the current regulations guidance or interpretations will be changed particularly in light of the recent presidential election or what the impact of such changes on our business if any may be Further it is possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the COVID19 pandemic Our operations and relationships with customers and thirdparty payors will be subject to applicable antikickback fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations which could expose us to penalties including criminal sanctions civil penalties contractual damages reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings Healthcare providers and thirdparty payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval Our future arrangements with providers thirdparty payors and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market sell and distribute any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval Restrictions under applicable US federal and state healthcare laws and regulations may include the following  the federal AntiKickback Statute prohibits among other things persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting offering receiving or providing remuneration directly or indirectly in cash or in kind to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for or the purchase order or recommendation of any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid 107 Table of Contents  federal false claims laws including the federal False Claims Act imposes criminal and civil penalties including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting or causing to be presented to the federal government claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government  the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 or HIPAA imposes criminal and civil liability for among other things knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters  HIPAA as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health or HITECH Act and its implementing regulations also imposes obligations including mandatory contractual terms on certain types of people and entities with respect to safeguarding the privacy security and transmission of individually identifiable health information  the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act requires applicable manufacturers of covered drugs devices biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare Medicaid or the Childrens Health Insurance Program with specific exceptions to report payments and other transfers of value to physicians defined to include doctors dentists optometrists podiatrists and chiropractors and teaching hospitals as well as certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family which includes annual data collection and reporting obligations Beginning in 2022 applicable manufacturers also will be required to report such information regarding its relationships with physician assistants nurse practitioners clinical nurse specialists certified registered nurse anesthetists anesthesiologist assistants and certified nurse midwives during the previous year and  analogous state and foreign laws and regulations such as state antikickback and false claims laws may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by nongovernmental thirdparty payors including private insurers  Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industrys voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government and may require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures Other state laws require reporting of certain pricing information including price increases State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA thus complicating compliance efforts Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us we may be subject to significant civil criminal and administrative penalties damages fines imprisonment exclusion of product candidates from governmentfunded healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid disgorgement oversight monitoring contractual damages reputational harm diminished profits and future earnings and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found to be not in compliance with applicable laws they may be subject to criminal civil or administrative sanctions including exclusions from governmentfunded healthcare programs Risks Related to Employee Matters Managing Growth and Other Risks Related to Our Business We expect to rapidly expand our manufacturing development and regulatory capabilities and as a result we may encounter difficulties in managing our growth which could disrupt our operations We expect to experience significant growth in the number of our employees and the scope of our operations particularly in the areas of manufacturing and clinical strategy and growing our capability to conduct clinical trials To manage our current development programs and anticipated future growth we must continue to implement and improve our managerial operational and financial systems expand our facilities and continue to recruit and train additional qualified 108 Table of Contents personnel Due to our limited financial resources and the limited experience of our management team in managing a company with such anticipated growth we may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations or recruit and train additional qualified personnel The expansion of our operations may lead to significant costs and may divert our management and business development resources Any inability to manage growth could delay the execution of our business plans or disrupt our operations Our future success depends on our ability to retain key executives and to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel We are highly dependent on the research and development clinical and business development expertise of our management scientific and clinical team We also benefit from the research expertise of Dr Wilson our Chief Scientific Advisor Although we have entered into a consulting agreement with Dr Wilson he may terminate his relationship with us at any time Although we have entered into employment letter agreements or employment agreements with our executive officers each of them may terminate their employment with us at any time We do not maintain key person insurance for any of our executives or other employees In addition we rely on consultants and advisors including scientific and clinical advisors to assist us in formulating our research and development and manufacturing strategy Our consultants and advisors may be employed by employers other than us and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us If we are unable to continue to attract and retain high quality personnel our ability to pursue our growth strategy will be limited Recruiting and retaining qualified scientific clinical manufacturing and if needed sales and marketing personnel will also be critical to our success The loss of the services of our executive officers or other key employees could impede the achievement of our research development and commercialization objectives and seriously harm our ability to successfully implement our business strategy Furthermore replacing executive officers and key employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in our industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to successfully develop gain regulatory approval of and commercialize drugs particularly within the gene therapy space Competition to hire from this limited pool is intense and we may be unable to hire train retain or motivate these key personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for similar personnel We also experience competition for the hiring of scientific and clinical personnel from universities and research institutions Failure to succeed in clinical trials may make it more challenging to recruit and retain qualified scientific personnel Our internal computer systems or those of our thirdparty collaborators or other contractors may fail or suffer security breaches which could result in a material disruption of our development programs We believe that we take reasonable steps that are designed to protect the security integrity and confidentiality of the information we collect use store and disclose but inadvertent or unauthorized data access may occur despite our efforts For example our system protections may be ineffective or inadequate or we could be impacted by software bugs or other technical malfunctions as well as employee error or malfeasance While we have not experienced any material losses as a result of any system failure accident or security breach to date we have been the subject of certain phishing attempts in the past If such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations it could result in a material disruption of our development programs and our business operations whether due to a loss of our trade secrets or other proprietary information or other similar disruptions For example the loss of clinical trial data from completed or future clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data In addition insurance coverage to compensate for any losses associated with such events may not be adequate to cover all potential losses The development and maintenance of these systems controls and processes is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become increasingly sophisticated To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of or damage to our data or applications or inappropriate disclosure of personal confidential or proprietary information we could incur liability our competitive position could be harmed and the further development and commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed 109 Table of Contents Our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to limitation As of December 31 2020 we had federal state and local net operating loss carryforwards or NOLs of 693 million 693 million and 691 million respectively an aggregate of 15 million of the federal and state NOLs will begin to expire in 2037 if unused and the remainder will carryforward indefinitely To the extent that we continue to generate taxable losses unused losses will carry forward to offset future taxable income if any Under legislative changes made by US federal tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act or the TCJA US federal net operating losses incurred in 2018 and in future years may be carried forward indefinitely but the ability to utilize such federal net operating losses to offset taxable income is limited to 80 of our taxable income before the deduction for such net operating loss carryovers It is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the TCJA Under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as amended or the IRC if a corporation undergoes an ownership change generally defined as a greater than 50 change by value in its equity ownership over a threeyear period the corporations ability to use its prechange NOLs and other prechange tax attributes such as research tax credits to offset its postchange income may be limited We have not undertaken a Section 382 study and it is possible that we have previously undergone one or more ownership changes so that our use of net operating losses is subject to limitation We may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership As a result if we earn net taxable income our ability to use our prechange NOLs to offset US federal taxable income may be subject to limitations which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us In addition at the state level there may be periods during which the use of NOLs is suspended or otherwise limited which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed US federal income tax reform and changes in other tax laws could adversely affect us In December 2017 the TCJA was signed into law significantly reforming the IRC The TCJA among other things includes changes to US federal tax rates imposes significant additional limitations on the deductibility of business interest allows for the expensing of capital expenditures taxes certain foreign earnings on a current basis and modifies or repeals many business deductions and credits We are still awaiting guidance from the IRS and other tax authorities on some of the TCJA changes that may affect us and components of the TCJA could be repealed or modified in future legislation Furthermore it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the TCJA or any newly enacted federal legislation In addition new legislation or regulation which could affect our tax burden could be enacted by any governmental authority We cannot predict the timing or extent of such taxrelated developments which could have a negative impact on our financial results Additionally we use our best judgment in attempting to quantify and reserve for these tax obligations However a challenge by a taxing authority our ability to utilize tax benefits such as carryforwards or tax credits or a deviation from other taxrelated assumptions could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition Our employees principal investigators CROs and consultants may engage in misconduct or other improper activities including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements and insider trading We are exposed to the risk of fraud or other misconduct by our employees principal investigators consultants and commercial partners Misconduct by these parties could include intentional failures to comply with the regulations of FDA and nonUS regulators provide accurate information to the FDA and nonUS regulators comply with healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations in the United States and abroad report financial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us In particular sales marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud misconduct kickbacks selfdealing and other abusive practices These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing discounting marketing and promotion sales commission customer incentive programs and other business arrangements Such misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical studies which could result in regulatory sanctions and cause serious harm to our reputation We have adopted a code of conduct applicable to all of our employees but it is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in 110 Table of Contents protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations If any such actions are instituted against us and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights those actions could have a significant impact on our business including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions Product liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and could limit commercialization of any product candidates that we may develop We will face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of our product candidates in clinical trials and will face an even greater risk if we commercialize any of our product candidates If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that our product candidates caused injuries we could incur substantial liabilities Regardless of merit or eventual outcome liability claims may result in  decreased demand for any product candidates that we may develop  injury to our reputation and significant negative media attention  initiation of investigations by regulators  withdrawal of clinical trial participants  significant time and costs to defend the related litigation  diversion of management and scientific resources from our business operations  substantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients  loss of revenue and  the inability to commercialize any product candidates that we may develop  We currently hold limited product liability insurance coverage We will need to purchase additional product liability insurance coverage as we expand our clinical trials and if we commence commercialization of our product candidates Insurance coverage is increasingly expensive We may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could decrease our cash and adversely affect our business and financial condition We are subject to US and certain foreign export and import controls sanctions embargoes anticorruption laws and antimoney laundering laws and regulations Compliance with these legal standards could impair our ability to compete in domestic and international markets We can face criminal liability and other serious consequences for violations which can harm our business We are subject to export control and import laws and regulations including the US Export Administration Regulations US Customs regulations various economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the US Treasury Departments Office of Foreign Assets Controls the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 as amended the US domestic bribery statute contained in 18 USC  201 the US Travel Act the USA PATRIOT Act and other state and national antibribery and antimoney laundering laws in the countries in which we conduct activities Anticorruption laws are interpreted broadly and prohibit companies and their employees agents contractors and other partners from authorizing promising offering or providing directly or indirectly improper payments or anything else of value to recipients in the public or private sector We may engage third parties for clinical trials outside of the United States to sell our products abroad once we enter a commercialization phase andor to obtain necessary permits licenses patent registrations and other regulatory approvals We have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or governmentaffiliated hospitals universities and other organizations We can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of our employees agents contractors and other partners even if we do not explicitly authorize or have actual knowledge of such activities Any violations of the laws and regulations described above may result in substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties imprisonment the loss of export or import privileges debarment tax reassessments breach of contract and fraud litigation reputational harm and other consequences 111 Table of Contents Risks Related to Our Common Stock The price of our common stock may be volatile and fluctuate substantially which could result in substantial losses for holders of our common stock Our stock price has been and is likely to continue to be volatile The stock market in general and the market for biotechnology companies in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors including  results of preclinical studies or clinical trials of our product candidates or those of our competitors  unanticipated or serious safety concerns related to the use of any of our product candidates  adverse regulatory decisions including failure to receive regulatory approval for any of our product candidates  the success of competitive drugs or technologies  regulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries applicable to our product candidates  the size and growth of our prospective patient populations  developments concerning our collaborators our external manufacturers or inhouse manufacturing capabilities  inability to obtain adequate product supply for any product candidate for preclinical studies clinical trials or future commercial sale or inability to do so at acceptable prices  developments or disputes concerning patent applications issued patents or other proprietary rights  the recruitment or departure of key personnel  the level of expenses related to any of our product candidates or clinical development programs  the results of our efforts to discover develop acquire or inlicense additional product candidates or drugs  actual or anticipated changes in estimates as to financial results development timelines or recommendations by securities analysts or publications of research reports about us or our industry  variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us  changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems  market conditions in the biotechnology sector  our cash position or the announcement or expectation of additional financing efforts  general economic industry and market conditions and  other factors including those described in this Risk Factors section many of which are beyond are control Our executive officers directors principal stockholders and their affiliates exercise significant influence over our company which will limit your ability to influence corporate matters and could delay or prevent a change in corporate control As of December 31 2020 our executive officers directors beneficial owners of 5 or more of our capital stock and their respective affiliates beneficially owned shares representing a substantial portion of our capital stock This group of stockholders has the ability to control us through this ownership position and may be able to determine all matters requiring stockholder approval For example these stockholders may be able to control elections of directors amendments of our organizational documents or approval of any merger sale of assets or other major corporate transaction This may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that you may feel are in your best interest as one of our stockholders The interests of this group of stockholders may not always coincide with your interests or the interests of other stockholders and they may act in a manner that advances their best interests and not necessarily those of other stockholders including seeking a premium value for their common stock and might affect the prevailing market price for our common stock 112 Table of Contents Because we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future capital appreciation if any will be your sole source of gain We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not currently intend to do so for the foreseeable future We currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future Any return to stockholders will be limited to the appreciation of stock Therefore the success of an investment in shares of our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in value of the stock We cannot guarantee you that shares of our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which our stockholders have purchased their shares If we fail to establish and maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting in the future our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired which could harm our operating results investors views of us and as a result the value of our common stock We are not currently required to comply with the Securities and Exchange Commissions or SECs rules that implement Section 404 of the SarbanesOxley Act and are therefore not required to make a formal assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for that purpose Pursuant to Section 404 we will be required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting However while we remain an emerging growth company we will not be required to include an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting issued by our independent registered public accounting firm To achieve compliance with Section 404 within the prescribed period we will be engaged in a process to document and evaluate our internal control over financial reporting which is both costly and challenging In this regard we will need to continue to dedicate internal resources potentially engage outside consultants and adopt a detailed work plan to assess and document the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting continue steps to improve control processes as appropriate validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting Despite our efforts there is a risk that we will not be able to conclude within the prescribed timeframe or at all that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as required by Section 404 If we identify one or more material weaknesses it could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements In addition if we are not able to continue to meet these requirements we may not be able to remain listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC or Nasdaq As we grow we expect to hire additional personnel and may utilize external temporary resources to implement document and modify policies and procedures to maintain effective internal controls However it is possible that we may identify deficiencies and weaknesses in our internal controls If material weaknesses or deficiencies in our internal controls exist and go undetected or unremediated our financial statements could contain material misstatements that when discovered in the future could cause us to fail to meet our future reporting obligations and cause the price of our common stock to decline We will continue to incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company and our management will continue to be required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives As a public company particularly after we are no longer an emerging growth company we will continue to incur significant legal accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company In addition the SarbanesOxley Act of 2002 and rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and Nasdaq have imposed various requirements on public companies including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives Moreover these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more timeconsuming and costly We are an emerging growth company and smaller reporting company and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies and smaller reporting companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors We are an emerging growth company as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 or the JOBS Act We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of i the last day of the fiscal year in which we have 113 Table of Contents total annual gross revenue of 107 billion or more ii December 31 2025 iii the date on which we have issued more than 10 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years or iv the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC which means the market value of our common stock that is held by nonaffiliates exceeds 7000 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter For so long as we remain an emerging growth company we are permitted and intend to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies These exemptions include  not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the SarbanesOxley Act of 2002  not being required to comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditors report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements  being permitted to present only two years of audited financial statements in addition to any required unaudited interim financial statements with correspondingly reduced Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations disclosure in this Form 10K  reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation and  exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved  We may choose to take advantage of some but not all of the available exemptions Even after we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company we may still qualify as a smaller reporting company which would allow us to take advantage of many of the same exemptions from disclosure requirements including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the SarbanesOxley Act and reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile In addition the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards This allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and therefore we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies We are also a smaller reporting company meaning that the market value of our stock held by nonaffiliates is less than 7000 million and our annual revenue is less than 1000 million during the most recently completed fiscal year We will continue to be a smaller reporting company if either i the market value of our stock held by nonaffiliates is less than 2500 million or ii our annual revenue is less than 1000 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and the market value of our stock held by nonaffiliates is less than 7000 million If we are a smaller reporting company at the time we cease to be an emerging growth company we may continue to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are available to smaller reporting companies Specifically as a smaller reporting company we may choose to present only the two most recent fiscal years of audited financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10K and similar to emerging growth companies smaller reporting companies have reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation The exclusive forum provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may limit a stockholders ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors officers or other employees which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims Our restated certificate of incorporation to the fullest extent permitted by law provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General 114 Table of Contents Corporation Law or the DGCL our restated certificate of incorporation or our restated bylaws or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine This exclusive forum provision does not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended or the Exchange Act It could apply however to a suit that falls within one or more of the categories enumerated in the exclusive forum provision and asserts claims under the Securities Act inasmuch as Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rule and regulations thereunder There is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce such provision with respect to claims under the Securities Act and our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder In March 2020 we amended and restated our restated bylaws to provide that the federal district courts of the United States of America will to the fullest extent permitted by law be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act or a Federal Forum Provision Our decision to adopt a Federal Forum Provision followed a decision by the Supreme Court of the State of Delaware holding that such provisions are facially valid under Delaware law While there can be no assurance that federal or state courts will follow the holding of the Delaware Supreme Court or determine that the Federal Forum Provision should be enforced in a particular case application of the Federal Forum Provision means that suits brought by our stockholders to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act must be brought in federal court and cannot be brought in state court These choice of forum provisions may limit a stockholders ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors officers or other employees which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims Alternatively if a court were to find the choice of forum provisions contained in our restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions which could harm our business results of operations and financial condition In addition Section 203 of the DGCL may discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company Section 203 imposes certain restrictions on mergers business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15 or more of our common stock Provisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us which may be beneficial to our stockholders more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management Provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and our restated bylaws may discourage delay or prevent a merger acquisition or other change in control of our company that stockholders may consider favorable including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock thereby depressing the market price of our common stock In addition because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors Among other things these provisions  establish a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board are elected at one time  permit only the board of directors to establish the number of directors and fill vacancies on the board  provide that directors may only be removed for cause and only with the approval of twothirds of our stockholders  require supermajority voting to amend some provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws  authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock that our board could use to implement a stockholder rights plan also known as a poison pill  eliminate the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders  prohibit stockholder action by written consent which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders 115 Table of Contents  prohibit cumulative voting and  establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings  Moreover we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law which prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15 of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15 of our outstanding voting stock unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner Any of these provisions of our charter documents or Delaware law could under certain circumstances depress the market price of our common stock General Risk Factors We may be subject to securities litigation which is expensive and could divert management attention The market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile The stock market in general and Nasdaq and biopharmaceutical companies in particular have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies In the past companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our managements attention from other business concerns which could seriously harm our business If securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they publish negative evaluations of our stock the price of our stock could decline The trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business We do not have any control over the analysts or the content and opinions included in their reports If one or more of the analysts covering our business downgrade their evaluations of our stock the trading price of our stock would likely decrease Even if we do obtain analyst coverage if one or more of the analysts covering our business downgrade their evaluations of our stock the price of our stock could decline If one or more of these analysts cease to cover our stock we could lose visibility in the market for our stock which in turn could cause our stock price to decline We are subject to a variety of privacy and data security laws and our failure to comply with them could harm our business We maintain a large quantity of sensitive information including confidential business and personal information in connection with our preclinical studies and our employees and are subject to laws and regulations governing the privacy and security of such information In the United States there are numerous federal and state privacy and data security laws and regulations governing the collection use disclosure and protection of personal information including federal and state health information privacy laws federal and state security breach notification laws and federal and state consumer protection laws Each of these constantly evolving laws can be subject to varying interpretations In May 2018 a new privacy regime the General Data Protection Regulation or the GDPR took effect in the European Economic Area or the EEA The GDPR governs the collection use disclosure transfer or other processing of personal data of European persons Among other things the GDPR imposes requirements regarding the security of personal data and notification of data processing obligations to the competent national data processing authorities changes the lawful bases on which personal data can be processed expands the definition of personal data and requires changes to informed consent practices as well as more detailed notices for clinical trial subjects and investigators In addition the GDPR increases the scrutiny of transfers of personal data from clinical trial sites located in the EEA to the United States and other jurisdictions that the European Commission does not recognize as having adequate data protection laws and imposes substantial fines for breaches and violations up to the greater of 20 million or 4 of our consolidated annual worldwide gross revenue The GDPR also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations 116 Table of Contents to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities seek judicial remedies and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the GDPR Compliance with these and any other applicable privacy and data security laws and regulations is a rigorous and timeintensive process and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the new data protection rules If we fail to comply with any such laws or regulations we may face significant fines and penalties that could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations Furthermore the laws are not consistent and compliance in the event of a widespread data breach is costly In addition states are constantly adopting new laws or amending existing laws requiring attention to frequently changing regulatory requirements For example California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act or the CCPA on June 28 2018 which takes effect on January 1 2020 and has been dubbed the first GDPRlike law in the United States The CCPA gives California residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information opt out of certain personal information sharing and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used by requiring covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers as that term is broadly defined and provide such consumers new ways to optout of certain sales of personal information The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation And California voters recently approved the California Privacy Rights Act or CPRA The CPRA significantly modifies the CCPA and will impose additional data protection obligations on companies doing business in California including additional consumer rights processes and opt outs for certain uses of sensitive data While the CPRA will not take effect until January 2023 it will establish a California privacy regulator before that date The CCPA and CPRA may increase our compliance costs and potential liability Some observers have noted that the CCPA could mark the beginning of a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the United States Other states are beginning to pass similar laws For example an amendment to Nevadas privacy laws which went into effect October 1 2019 requires us to offer to consumers the right to optout of the sale of their personal information Unfavorable global economic conditions could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations Our results of operations could be adversely affected by general conditions in the global economy and in the global financial markets For example the global financial crisis caused extreme volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets A severe or prolonged economic downturn such as the global financial crisis could result in a variety of risks to our business including weakened demand for our product candidates and our ability to raise additional capital when needed on acceptable terms if at all A weak or declining economy could also strain our suppliers possibly resulting in supply disruption or cause our customers to delay making payments for our services Any of the foregoing could harm our business and we cannot anticipate all of the ways in which the current economic climate and financial market conditions could adversely impact our business We or the third parties upon whom we depend may be adversely affected by natural disasters and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from a serious disaster Natural disasters could severely disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and prospects If a natural disaster power outage or other event occurred that prevented us from using all or a significant portion of our headquarters that damaged critical infrastructure such as our manufacturing facilities or that otherwise disrupted operations it may be difficult or in certain cases impossible for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time The disaster recovery and business continuity plans we have in place may prove inadequate in the event of a serious disaster or similar event We may incur substantial expenses as a result of the limited nature of our disaster recovery and business continuity plans which could have a material adverse effect on our business  117 Table of Contents Item 1B Unresolved Staff Comments None  118 Table of Contents Item 2 Properties and Facilities Our principal executive office is located in Philadelphia Pennsylvania where we lease a total of 8887 square feet of office space that we use for our administrative research and development and other activities In April 2020 we entered into a lease agreement for new principal executive offices which we expect to commence in March 2021 and amended our existing lease to terminate upon commencement of the new lease This new office lease is for approximately 37000 square feet of office space in Philadelphia Pennsylvania which will expire in January 2031 subject to our option to extend the term of the lease by up to two additional fiveyear terms We also lease approximately 62000 square feet

sufficient delivery condition We have an option to extend the term of the lease by up to two additional fiveyear terms  119 Table of Contents Item 3 Legal Proceedings From time to time we may be involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business We are not presently a party to any legal proceedings that in the opinion of management would have a material adverse
