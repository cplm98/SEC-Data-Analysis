Business and Growth Strategies Business Strategies Our primary business objective is to maximize return on investment to provide our investors with the greatest possible total return in all points of the economic cycle Our strategies to achieve this objective are  to target a few carefully selected geographic marketsBoston Los Angeles New York San Francisco and Washington DCand to be one of the leading if not the leading developers owners and managers in each of those markets with a fullservice office in each market providing property management leasing development construction and legal expertise We select markets and submarkets with a diverse economic base and a deep pool of prospective tenants in various industries and where tenants have demonstrated a preference for highquality office buildings and other facilities Additionally our markets have historically been able to recruit new talent to them and as such created job growth that results in growth in rental rates and occupancy over time We have explored and may continue to explore for future investment select domestic and international markets that exhibit these same traits 6 Table of Contents  to emphasize markets and submarkets within those markets where the difficulty of receiving the necessary approvals for development and the necessary financing constitute high barriers to the creation of new supply and where skill financial strength and diligence are required to successfully develop finance and manage highquality office research and development space as well as selected retail and residential space  to take on complex technically challenging development projects leveraging the skills of our management team to successfully develop acquire or reposition properties that other organizations may not have the capacity or resources to pursue  to own and develop highquality real estate designed to meet the demands of todays tenants who require sophisticated telecommunications and related infrastructure support services sustainable features and amenities and to manage those facilities so as to become the landlord of choice for both existing and prospective clients  to opportunistically acquire assets that increase our market share in the markets in which we have chosen to concentrate as well as potential new markets which exhibit an opportunity to improve returns through repositioning through a combination of capital improvements and shift in marketing strategy changes in management focus and leasing  to explore joint venture opportunities with existing property owners located in desirable locations who seek to benefit from the depth of development and management expertise we are able to provide and our access to capital andor to explore joint venture opportunities with strategic institutional partners leveraging our skills as developers owners and managers of Class A office space and mixeduse complexes  to pursue on a selective basis the sale of properties or interests therein including core properties to either 1 take advantage of the demand for our premier properties and realize the value we have created or 2 pare from our portfolio properties that we believe have slower future growth potential  to seek thirdparty development contracts to enable us to retain and utilize our existing development and construction management staff especially when our internal development is less active or when new development is lesswarranted due to market conditions and  to enhance our capital structure through our access to a variety of sources of capital and proactively manage our debt expirations In the current economic climate with relatively low interest rates we have and will continue to attempt to lower the cost of our debt capital and seek opportunities to lock in such low rates through early debt repayment refinancings and interest rate hedges Growth Strategies External Growth Strategies We believe that our development experience our organizational depth and our balance sheet position us to continue to selectively develop a range of property types including highrise urban developments mixeduse developments including office residential and retail lowrise suburban office properties and research and laboratory space within budget and on schedule We believe we are also well positioned to achieve external growth through acquisitions Other factors that contribute to our competitive position include  our control of sites including sites under contract or option to acquire in our markets that could support approximately 155 million additional square feet of new office retail and residential development  our reputation gained through 50 years of successful operations and the stability and strength of our existing portfolio of properties  our relationships with leading national corporations universities and public institutions including government agencies seeking new facilities and development services  our relationships with nationally recognized financial institutions that provide capital to the real estate industry  our track record and reputation for executing acquisitions efficiently provide comfort to domestic and foreign institutions private investors and corporations who seek to sell commercial real estate in our market areas 7 Table of Contents  our ability to act quickly on due diligence and financing  our relationships with institutional buyers and sellers of highquality real estate assets  our ability to procure entitlements from multiple municipalities to develop sites and attract land owners to sell or partner with us and  our relationship with domestic and foreign investors who seek to partner with companies like ours Opportunities to execute our external growth strategy fall into three categories  Development in selected submarkets We believe the selected development of wellpositioned office buildings residential buildings and mixeduse complexes may be justified in our markets We believe in acquiring land after taking into consideration timing factors relating to economic cycles and in response to market conditions that allow for its development at the appropriate time While we purposely concentrate in markets with high barrierstoentry we have demonstrated throughout our 50 year history an ability to make carefully timed land acquisitions in submarkets where we can become one of the market leaders in establishing rent and other business terms We believe that there are opportunities at key locations in our existing and other markets for a wellcapitalized developer to acquire land with development potential In the past we have been particularly successful at acquiring sites or options to purchase sites that need governmental approvals for development Because of our development expertise knowledge of the governmental approval process and reputation for quality development with local government regulatory bodies we generally have been able to secure the permits necessary to allow development and to profit from the resulting increase in land value We seek complex projects where we can add value through the efforts of our experienced and skilled management team leading to attractive returns on investment Our strong regional relationships and recognized development expertise have enabled us to capitalize on unique buildtosuit opportunities We intend to seek and expect to continue to be presented with such opportunities in the near term allowing us to earn relatively significant returns on these development opportunities through multiple business cycles  Acquisition of assets and portfolios of assets from institutions or individuals We believe that due to our size management strength and reputation we are well positioned to acquire portfolios of assets or individual properties from institutions or individuals if valuations meet our criteria In addition we believe that our market knowledge and our liquidity and access to capital may provide us with a competitive advantage when pursuing acquisitions Opportunities to acquire properties may also come through the purchase of first mortgage or mezzanine debt We are also able to appeal to sellers wishing to contribute on a taxdeferred basis their ownership of property for equity in a diversified real estate operating company that offers liquidity through access to the public equity markets in addition to a quarterly distribution Our ability to offer common and preferred units of limited partnership in BPLP to sellers who would otherwise recognize a taxable gain upon a sale of assets for cash or BXPs common stock may facilitate this type of transaction on a taxefficient basis Recent Treasury regulations may limit certain of the tax benefits previously available to sellers in these transactions  Acquisition of underperforming assets and portfolios of assets  We believe that because of our indepth market knowledge and development experience in each of our markets our national reputation with brokers financial institutions owners of real estate and others involved in the real estate market and our access to competitivelypriced capital we are wellpositioned to identify and acquire existing underperforming properties for competitive prices and to add significant additional value to such properties through our effective marketing strategies repositioningredevelopment expertise and a responsive property management program 8 Table of Contents Internal Growth Strategies We believe that opportunities will exist to increase cash flow from our existing properties through an increase in occupancy and rental rates because they are of high quality and in desirable locations Additionally our markets have diversified economies that have historically experienced job growth and increased use of office space resulting in growth in rental rates and occupancy over time Our strategy for maximizing the benefits from these opportunities is threefold 1 to provide highquality property management services using our employees in order to encourage tenants to renew expand and relocate in our properties 2 to achieve speed and transaction cost efficiency in replacing departing tenants through the use of inhouse services for marketing lease negotiation and construction of tenant and capital improvements and 3 to work with new or existing tenants with space expansion or contraction needs leveraging our expertise and clustering of assets to maximize the cash flow from our assets We expect to continue our internal growth as a result of our ability to  Cultivate existing submarkets and longterm relationships with credit tenants In choosing locations for our properties we have paid particular attention to transportation and commuting patterns physical environment adjacency to established business centers and amenities proximity to sources of business growth and other local factors The weightedaverage lease term of our inplace leases including leases signed by our unconsolidated joint ventures was approximately 84 years at December 31 2019  and we continue to cultivate longterm leasing relationships with a diverse base of highquality financially stable tenants Based on leases in place at December 31 2019  leases with respect to approximately 70 of the total square feet in our portfolio including unconsolidated joint ventures will expire in calendar year 2020  Directly manage our office properties to maximize the potential for tenant retention We provide property management services ourselves rather than contracting for this service to maintain awareness of and responsiveness to tenant needs We and our properties also benefit from cost efficiencies produced by an experienced work force attentive to preventive maintenance and energy management and from our continuing programs to assure that our property management personnel at all levels remain aware of their important role in tenant relations In addition we reinvest in our properties by adding new services and amenities that are desirable to our tenants  Replace tenants quickly at best available market terms and lowest possible transaction costs  We believe that we are wellpositioned to attract new tenants and achieve relatively high rental and occupancy rates as a result of our welllocated welldesigned and wellmaintained properties our reputation for highquality building services and responsiveness to tenants and our ability to offer expansion and relocation alternatives within our submarkets  Extend terms of existing leases to existing tenants prior to expiration  We have also successfully structured early tenant renewals which have reduced the cost associated with lease downtime while securing the tenancy of our highest quality creditworthy tenants on a longterm basis and enhancing relationships  Redevelopment of existing assets We believe the select redevelopment of assets within our portfolio where through the ability to increase the building size andor to increase cash flow and generate appropriate returns on incremental investment after consideration of the assets current and future cash flows may be desirable This generally occurs in situations in which we are able to increase the buildings size improve building systems and sustainability features andor add tenant amenities thereby increasing tenant demand generating acceptable returns on incremental investment and enhancing the longterm value of the property and the company In the past we have been particularly successful at gaining local government approval for increased density at several of our assets providing the opportunity to enhance value at a particular location Our strong regional relationships and recognized redevelopment expertise have enabled us to capitalize on unique buildtosuit opportunities We intend to seek and expect to continue to be presented with such opportunities in the near term allowing us to earn attractive returns on these development opportunities through multiple business cycles Policies with Respect to Certain Activities The discussion below sets forth certain additional information regarding our investment financing and other policies These policies have been determined by BXPs Board of Directors and in general may be amended or revised from time to time by the Board of Directors 9 Table of Contents Investment Policies Investments in Real Estate or Interests in Real Estate Our investment objectives are to provide quarterly cash dividendsdistributions to our securityholders and to achieve longterm capital appreciation through increases in our value We have not established a specific policy regarding the relative priority of these investment objectives We expect to continue to pursue our investment objectives primarily through the ownership of our current properties development projects and other acquired properties We currently intend to continue to invest primarily in developments of properties and acquisitions of existing improved properties or properties in need of redevelopment and acquisitions of land that we believe have development potential primarily in our existing markets of Boston Los Angeles New York San Francisco and Washington DC We have explored and may continue to explore for future investment select domestic and international markets that exhibit these same traits Future investment or development activities will not be limited to a specified percentage of our assets We intend to engage in such future investment or development activities in a manner that is consistent with the maintenance of BXPs status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes In addition we may purchase or lease incomeproducing commercial and other types of properties for longterm investment expand and improve the real estate presently owned or other properties purchased or sell such real estate properties in whole or in part when circumstances warrant We do not have a policy that restricts the amount or percentage of assets that will be invested in any specific property however our investments may be restricted by our debt covenants We may also continue to participate with third parties in property ownership through joint ventures or other types of coownership These investments may permit us to own interests in larger assets without unduly restricting diversification and therefore add flexibility in structuring our portfolio Equity investments may be subject to existing mortgage financing and other indebtedness or such financing or indebtedness as may be incurred in connection with acquiring or refinancing these investments Debt service on such financing or indebtedness will have a priority over any distributions with respect to BXPs common stock Investments are also subject to our policy not to be treated as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 as amended the 1940 Act Investments in Real Estate Mortgages While our current portfolio consists primarily of and our business objectives emphasize equity investments in commercial real estate we may at the discretion of the Board of Directors of BXP invest in mortgages and other types of real estate interests consistent with BXPs qualification as a REIT Investments in real estate mortgages run the risk that one or more borrowers may default under such mortgages and that the collateral securing such mortgages may not be sufficient to enable us to recoup our full investment We may invest in participating convertible or traditional mortgages if we conclude that we may benefit from the cash flow or any appreciation in value of the property or as an entrance to the fee ownership As of December 31 2019  we had two note receivables outstanding which aggregated approximately 959 million  Securities of or Interests in Entities Primarily Engaged in Real Estate Activities Subject to the percentage of ownership limitations and gross income and asset tests necessary for BXPs REIT qualification we also may invest in securities of other REITs other entities engaged in real estate activities or securities of other issuers including for the purpose of exercising control over such entities Dispositions Our decision to dispose or partially dispose of properties is based upon the periodic review of our portfolio and the determination by the Board of Directors of BXP that such action would be in our best interests Any decision to dispose of a property will be authorized by the Board of Directors of BXP or a committee thereof Some holders of limited partnership interests in BPLP could incur adverse tax consequences upon the sale of certain of our properties that differ from the tax consequences to BXP Consequently holders of limited partnership interests in BPLP may have different objectives regarding the appropriate pricing and timing of any such sale Such different tax treatment derives in most cases from the fact that we acquired these properties in exchange for partnership interests in contribution transactions structured to allow the prior owners to defer taxable gain Generally this deferral continues so long as we do not dispose of the properties in a taxable transaction Unless a sale by us of these properties is structured as a likekind exchange under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue of 1986 as amended the Code or in a manner that otherwise allows deferral to continue recognition of the deferred tax gain 10 Table of Contents allocable to these prior owners is generally triggered by a sale As of December 31 2019  we have no properties that are subject to a tax protection agreement Financing Policies The agreement of limited partnership of BPLP and BXPs certificate of incorporation and bylaws do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness that we may incur Further we do not have a policy limiting the amount of indebtedness that we may incur nor have we established any limit on the number or amount of mortgages that may be placed on any single property or on our portfolio as a whole However our mortgages credit facilities joint venture agreements and unsecured debt securities contain customary restrictions requirements and other limitations on our ability to incur indebtedness In addition we evaluate the impact of incremental leverage on our debt metrics and the credit ratings of BPLPs publicly traded debt A reduction in BPLPs credit ratings could result in us borrowing money at higher interest rates The Board of Directors of BXP will consider a number of factors when evaluating our level of indebtedness and when making decisions regarding the incurrence of indebtedness including the purchase price of properties to be acquired with debt financing the estimated market value of our properties upon refinancing the entering into agreements such as interest rate swaps caps floors and other interest rate hedging contracts and the ability of particular properties and us as a whole to generate cash flow to cover expected debt service Policies with Respect to Other Activities As the sole general partner of BPLP BXP has the authority to issue additional common and preferred units of limited partnership interest of BPLP BXP has issued and may in the future issue common or preferred units of limited partnership interest to persons who contribute their direct or indirect interests in properties to us in exchange for such common or preferred units We have not engaged in trading underwriting or agency distribution or sale of securities of issuers other than BXP and BPLP does not intend to do so At all times we intend to make investments in such a manner as to enable BXP to maintain its qualification as a REIT unless due to changes in circumstances or to the tax code the Board of Directors of BXP determines that it is no longer in the best interest of BXP to qualify as a REIT We may make loans to third parties including without limitation to joint ventures in which we participate or in connection with the disposition of a property We intend to make investments in such a way that we will not be treated as an investment company under the 1940 Act Our policies with respect to these and other activities may be reviewed and modified or amended from time to time by the Board of Directors of BXP Sustainability Our Sustainability Strategy As the largest publiclytraded office REIT based on total market capitalization as of December 31 2019 in the United States that develops

metrics designed for disclosure in mandatory filings such as the Annual Report on Form 10K and serves as the framework against which we have aligned our disclosures for sustainability information The recommended energy and water management activity metrics for the real estate industry include energy consumption data coverage as a percentage of floor area Energy Intensity percentage of eligible portfolio that is certified ENERGY STAR ENERGY STAR certified total energy consumed by portfolio area Total Energy Consumption water withdrawal as a percentage of total floor area Water Intensity and total water withdrawn by portfolio area Total Water Consumption Energy and water data is collected from utility bills and submeters and is assured by a thirdparty including all SASB 2018 energy and water metrics which have been assured During the 2018 calendar year 68 buildings representing 71 of our eligible portfolio were ENERGY STAR certified A licensed professional has verified all ENERGY STAR applications The charts below detail our Energy Intensity Total Energy Consumption Water Intensity and Total Water Consumption for 2015 through 2018 for which data on occupied and activelymanaged properties was available 12345  1 Full 2019 calendar year energy and water data will not be available to be assured by a third party until March 31 2020 2018 is the most recent year for which complete energy and water data is available and assured by a third party 12 Table of Contents 2 The charts reflect the performance of our occupied and activelymanaged office building portfolio in Boston Los Angeles New York San Francisco and Washington DC Occupied office buildings are buildings with no more than 50 vacancy Activelymanaged buildings are buildings where we have operational control of building system performance and investment decisions At the end of the 2018 calendar year this included 97 buildings totaling 392 million gross square feet 3 Floor area is considered to have complete energy consumption data coverage when energy consumption data ie energy types and amounts consumed is obtained by us for all types of energy consumed in the relevant floor area during the calendar year regardless of when such data was obtained 4 The scope of energy includes energy purchased from sources external to us and our tenants or produced by us or our tenants and energy from all sources including fuel gas electricity and steam Energy use intensity kBtuSF has been weather normalized 5 Water sources include surface water including water from wetlands rivers lakes and oceans groundwater rainwater collected directly and stored by the registrant wastewater obtained from other entities municipal water supplies or supply from other water utilities Climate Resilience We are focused on climate preparedness and resiliency in advancement of our sustainability strategy As a longterm owner and active manager of real estate assets in operation and under development we strive to obtain adaptive capacity by continuing to proactively implement measures and planning and decisionmaking processes to protect our investments by improving resilience We are preparing for longterm climate risk by considering climate change scenarios and will continue to assess climate change vulnerabilities resulting from potential future climate scenarios and sea level rise Eventdriven acute and longerterm chronic physical risks that may result from climate change could have a material adverse effect on our properties operations and business Managements role in assessing and managing these climaterelated risks and initiatives is spread across multiple teams across our organization including our executive leadership and our Sustainability Risk Management Development Construction and Property Management departments Climate resilience measures include training and implementation of emergency response plans and the engagement of our executives and BXPs Board of Directors on climate change and other environmental social and governance ESG aspects Reporting A notable part of our commitment to sustainable development and operations is our commitment to transparent reporting of ESG performance indicators as we recognize the importance of this information to investors lenders and others in understanding how BXP assesses sustainability information and evaluates risks and opportunities We publish an annual sustainability report that is aligned with the Global Reporting Initiative reporting framework United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and the SASB framework and includes our strategy key performance indicators annual likeforlike comparisons achievements and historical sustainability reports which is available on our website at httpwwwbxpcom under the heading Sustainability In addition we continue to work to further align our reporting with the recommendations of the Financial Stability Boards Task Force on Climaterelated Financial Disclosures TCFD to disclose climaterelated financial risks and opportunities In 2018 and 2019 BPLP issued an aggregate of 185 billion of green bonds The terms of the green bonds have use of proceeds restrictions limiting its allocation to eligible green projects We published our first Green Bond Allocation Report in June 2019 disclosing the full allocation of approximately 988 million in net proceeds from BPLPs inaugural green bond offering to the eligible green project at our Salesforce Tower property in San Francisco California The Green Bond Allocation Report is available on our website at httpwwwbxpcom under the heading Sustainability Except for the documents specifically incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10K information contained on our website or that can be accessed through our website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10K Environmental Matters It is our policy to retain independent environmental consultants to conduct or update Phase I environmental assessments which generally do not involve invasive techniques such as soil or ground water sampling and asbestos surveys in connection with our acquisition of properties These prepurchase environmental assessments have not revealed environmental conditions that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our business assets financial condition results of operations or liquidity and we are not otherwise aware of environmental conditions with respect to our properties that we believe would have such a material adverse effect However from 13 Table of Contents time to time environmental conditions at our properties have required and may in the future require environmental testing andor regulatory filings as well as remedial action In February 1999 we through a joint venture acquired from Exxon Corporation a property in Massachusetts that was formerly used as a petroleum bulk storage and distribution facility and was known by the state regulatory authority to contain soil and groundwater contamination We developed an office park on the property We engaged a specially licensed environmental consultant to oversee the management of contaminated soil and groundwater that was disturbed in the course of construction Under the property acquisition agreement Exxon agreed to 1 bear the liability arising from releases or discharges of oil and hazardous substances which occurred at the site prior to our ownership 2 continue monitoring andor remediating such releases and discharges as necessary and appropriate to comply with applicable requirements and 3 indemnify us for certain losses arising from preexisting site conditions Any indemnity claim may be subject to various defenses and there can be no assurance that the amounts paid under the indemnity if any would be sufficient to cover the liabilities arising from any such releases and discharges Environmental investigations at some of our properties and certain properties owned by our affiliates have identified groundwater contamination migrating from offsite source properties In each case we engaged a licensed environmental consultant to perform the necessary investigations and assessments and to prepare any required submittals to the regulatory authorities In each case the environmental consultant concluded that the properties qualify under the regulatory program or the regulatory practice for a status which eliminates certain deadlines for conducting response actions at a site We also believe that these properties qualify for liability relief under certain statutory provisions or regulatory practices regarding upgradient releases Although we believe that the current or former owners of the upgradient source properties may bear responsibility for some or all of the costs of addressing the identified groundwater contamination we will take such further response actions if any that we deem necessary or advisable Other than periodic testing at some of these properties no such additional response actions are anticipated at this time Some of our properties and certain properties owned by our affiliates are located in urban industrial and other previously developed areas where fill or current or historical use of the areas have caused site contamination Accordingly it is sometimes necessary to institute special soil andor groundwater handling procedures andor include particular building design features in connection with development construction and other property operations in order to achieve regulatory closure andor ensure that contaminated materials are addressed in an appropriate manner In these situations it is our practice to investigate the nature and extent of detected contamination including potential issues associated with contaminant migration assess potential liability risks and estimate the costs of required response actions and special handling procedures We then use this information as part of our decisionmaking process with respect to the acquisition deal structure andor development of the property For example we own a parcel in Massachusetts which was formerly used as a quarryasphalt batching facility Prepurchase testing indicated that the site contained relatively low levels of certain contaminants We have developed an office park on this property Prior to and during redevelopment activities we engaged a specially licensed environmental consultant to monitor environmental conditions at the site and prepare necessary regulatory submittals based on the results of an environmental risk characterization A submittal has been made to the regulatory authorities in order to achieve regulatory closure at this site The submittal included an environmental deed restriction that mandates compliance with certain protective measures in a portion of the site where low levels of residual soil contamination have been left in place in accordance with applicable laws We expect that resolution of the environmental matters described above will not have a material impact on our business assets financial condition results of operations or liquidity However we cannot assure you that we have identified all environmental liabilities at our properties that all necessary remediation actions have been or will be undertaken at our properties that we will be indemnified in full or at all or that we will have insurance coverage in the event that such environmental liabilities arise Corporate Governance BXP is currently governed by an elevenmember

corporate governance documents and procedures in place  The Board of Directors has adopted charters for each of its Audit Compensation and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees A copy of each of these charters is available on our website at httpwwwbxpcom under the heading Corporate Governance and subheading Committees and Charters  The Board of Directors has adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines a copy of which is available on our website at httpwwwbxpcom under the heading Corporate Governance and subheading Governance Guidelines  The Board of Directors has adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics which governs business decisions made and actions taken by BXPs directors officers and employees A copy of this code is available on our website at httpwwwbxpcom under the heading Corporate Governance and subheading Code of Conduct and Ethics BXP intends to disclose on this website any amendment to or waiver of any provisions of this Code applicable to the directors and executive officers of BXP that would otherwise be required to be disclosed under the rules of the SEC or the New York Stock Exchange  The Board of Directors has established an ethics reporting system that employees may use to anonymously report possible violations of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics including concerns regarding questionable accounting internal accounting controls or auditing matters by telephone or over the internet  The Board of Directors has adopted a Policy on our Political Spending a copy of which is available on our website at httpwwwbxpcom under the heading Corporate Governance and subheading Policy on Political Spending Competition We compete in the leasing of office retail and residential space with a considerable number of other real estate companies some of which may have greater marketing and financial resources than are available to us In addition our hotel property competes for guests with other hotels some of which may have greater marketing and financial resources than are available to us and to the manager of our one hotel Marriott International Inc Principal factors of competition in our primary business of owning acquiring and developing office properties are the quality of properties leasing terms including rent and other charges and allowances for tenant improvements attractiveness and convenience of location the quality and breadth of tenant services and amenities provided and reputation as an owner and operator of quality office properties in the relevant market Additionally our ability to compete depends upon among other factors trends in the national and local economies investment alternatives financial condition and operating results of current and prospective tenants availability and cost of capital construction and renovation costs taxes utilities governmental regulations legislation and population trends 15 Table of Contents In addition we currently have six residential properties including two properties under construction and may in the future decide to acquire or develop additional residential properties As an owner we will also face competition for prospective residents from other operatorsowners whose properties may be perceived to offer a better location or better amenities or whose rent may be perceived as a better value given the quality location and amenities that the resident seeks We will also compete against condominiums and singlefamily homes that are for sale or rent Because the scale of our residential portfolio is relatively small we expect to continue to retain third parties to manage our residential properties Our Hotel Property We operate our hotel property through a taxable REIT subsidiary The taxable REIT subsidiary a whollyowned subsidiary of BPLP is the lessee pursuant to a lease for the hotel property As lessor BPLP is entitled to a percentage of gross receipts from the hotel property The hotel lease is intended to provide the economic benefits of ownership of the underlying real estate to flow to us as rental income while our taxable REIT subsidiary earns the profit from operating the property as a hotel Marriott International Inc continues to manage the hotel property under the Marriott name and under terms of the existing management agreements Marriott has been engaged under a separate longterm incentive management agreement to operate and manage the hotel on behalf of the taxable REIT subsidiary Recent Tax Legislation Affecting BXP and BPLP The following discussion supplements and updates the disclosures under United States Federal Income Tax Considerations in the prospectus dated June 2 2017 contained in our Registration Statement on Form S3 filed with the SEC on June 2 2017 as well as the disclosures under United States Federal Income Tax Considerations in the prospectus supplement dated June 2 2017 Qualified Group Legal Services Section 501c20 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as amended the Code has been repealed Therefore the reference to qualified group legal services plans under  United States Federal Income Tax ConsiderationsTaxation of TaxExempt Stockholders  is no longer applicable Backup Withholding The rate for backup withholding has recently been reduced It is now 24 not 28 as stated in  United States Federal Income Tax ConsiderationsTaxation of Holders of Certain Fixed Rate Debt SecuritiesTaxation of Taxable US Holders  Certain Foreign Income Inclusions The Internal Revenue Service has advised that if a REIT is a shareholder of a controlled foreign corporation or a passive foreign investment company the income it must recognize on account of such ownership under sections 951a1 951A 1291a  1293a1 or  1296a will generally be treated as qualifying income for purposes of the 95 gross income test In addition foreign currency gain with respect to distributions of previously taxed earnings and profits will generally be excluded from income for purposes of the 95 gross income test Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 the TCJA generally applicable for tax years beginning after December 31 2017 made significant changes to the Code including a number of provisions of the Code that affect the taxation of businesses and their owners including REITs and their stockholders Among other changes these include the following  For tax years beginning before January 1 2026 noncorporate taxpayers are permitted to take a 20 deduction for certain passthrough business income including dividends received from REITs that are not designated as capital gain dividends or qualified dividend income subject to certain limitations The maximum US federal income tax rate for individuals has been reduced from 396 to 37 16 Table of Contents  The maximum US federal income tax rate for corporations has been reduced from 35 to 21 and the alternative minimum tax has been eliminated for corporations which would generally reduce the amount of US federal income tax payable by our taxable REIT subsidiaries and by us to the extent we were subject corporate US federal income tax for example if we distributed less than 100 of our taxable income or recognized builtin gains in assets acquired from C corporations In addition the maximum withholding rate on distributions by us to nonUS stockholders that are treated as attributable to gain from the sale or exchange of a US real property interest was reduced from 35 to 21  Certain new limitations on the deductibility of interest expense now apply which limitations may affect the deductibility of interest paid or accrued by us or our taxable REIT subsidiaries Alternatively we may be able to avoid the new limitations on interest expense by irrevocably electing to treat an investment as an electing real property trade or business As a consequence of making such election we would be required to use an alternative depreciation system with generally longer recovery periods We have made this election for our own leasing business and will determine whether to make such election for any investment held through an entity we control  Certain new limitations on net operating losses now apply which limitations may affect net operating losses generated by us or our taxable REIT subsidiaries  New accounting rules generally require us to recognize certain income items for federal income tax purposes no later than when we take the item into account for financial statement purposes which may accelerate our recognition of certain income items This summary does not purport to be a detailed discussion of the changes to US federal income tax laws as a result of the enactment of the TCJA Technical corrections or other amendments to the TCJA or administrative guidance interpreting the TCJA may be forthcoming at any time We cannot predict the longterm effect of the TCJA or any future law changes on REITs or their stockholders Investors are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the effect of the TCJA based on their particular circumstances Consolidated Appropriations Act On March 23 2018 President Donald J Trump signed into law the Consolidated

to US Stockholders unless an applicable income tax treaty provides otherwise and may be subject to the 30 branch profits tax on its effectively connected earnings and profits subject to adjustments in the case of a foreign corporation FATCA Proposed Regulations On December 18 2018 the Internal Revenue Service promulgated proposed regulations under Sections 14711474 of the Code commonly referred to as FATCA which proposed regulations eliminate FATCA withholding on gross proceeds and thus implicate certain taxrelated disclosures contained in the prospectus and the prospectus supplement While

furnishes identifying information regarding each substantial United States owner Withholdable payment generally means any payment of interest dividends and certain other types of generally passive income if such payment is from sources within the United States If the payee is a foreign financial institution it must enter into an agreement with the United States Treasury requiring among other things that it undertakes to identify accounts held by certain United States persons or United Statesowned foreign entities annually report certain information about such accounts and withhold 30 on payments to account holders whose actions prevent them from complying with these reporting and other requirements Investors in jurisdictions that have entered into intergovernmental agreements may in lieu of the foregoing requirements be required to report such information to their home jurisdictions Prospective investors should consult their tax advisors regarding this legislation 18 Table of Contents Item 1A Risk Factors Set forth below are the risks that we believe are material to our investors We refer to the equity and debt securities of both BXP and BPLP as our securities and the investors who own securities or both as our securityholders This section contains forwardlooking statements You should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forwardlooking statements beginning on page 55  Our performance and value are subject to risks associated with our real estate assets and with the real estate industry Our economic performance and the value of our real estate assets and consequently the value of our securities are subject to the risk that if our properties do not generate revenues sufficient to meet our operating expenses including debt service and capital expenditures our cash flow and ability to pay distributions to our securityholders will be adversely affected The following factors among others may adversely affect the income generated by our properties  downturns in the national regional and local economic conditions particularly increases in unemployment  competition from other office hotel retail and residential buildings  local real estate market conditions such as oversupply or reduction in demand for office hotel retail or residential space  changes in interest rates and availability of financing  vacancies changes in market rental rates and the need to periodically repair renovate and relet space  changes in space utilization by our tenants due to technology economic conditions and business culture  increased operating costs including insurance expense utilities real estate taxes state and local taxes and heightened security costs  civil disturbances earthquakes and other natural disasters or terrorist acts or acts of war which may result in uninsured or underinsured losses or decrease the desirability to our tenants in impacted locations  significant expenditures associated with each investment such as debt service payments real estate taxes including reassessments and changes in tax laws insurance and maintenance costs which are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in revenues from a property  declines in the financial condition of our tenants and our ability to collect rents from our tenants and  decreases in the underlying value of our real estate We are dependent upon the economic climates of our marketsBoston Los Angeles New York San Francisco and Washington DC Substantially all of our revenue is derived from properties located in five markets Boston Los Angeles New York San Francisco and Washington DC A downturn in the economies of these markets or the impact that a downturn in the overall national economy may have upon these economies could result in reduced demand for office space andor a reduction in rents Because our portfolio consists primarily of office buildings as compared to a more diversified real estate portfolio a decrease in demand for office space in turn could adversely affect our results of operations Additionally there are submarkets within our markets that are dependent upon a limited number of industries For example in our Washington DC market we focus on leasing office properties to governmental agencies and contractors as well as legal firms A reduction in spending by the federal government could result in reduced demand for office space and adversely affect our results of operations In addition in our New York market we have historically leased properties to financial legal and other professional firms A significant downturn in one or more of these sectors could adversely affect our results of operations In addition a significant economic downturn over a period of time could result in an event or change in circumstances that results in an impairment in the value of our properties or our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the asset 1 is not recoverable over its expected holding period and 2 exceeds its fair value There can be no assurance that we will not take charges in 19 Table of Contents the future related to the impairment of our assets or investments Any future impairment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the charge is taken Our actual costs to develop properties may exceed our budgeted costs We intend to continue to develop and substantially renovate office retail and residential properties Our current and future development and construction activities may be exposed to the following risks  we may be unable to proceed with the development of properties because we cannot obtain financing on favorable terms or at all  we may incur construction costs for a development project that exceed our original estimates due to increases in interest rates and increased materials labor leasing or other costs which could make completion of the project less profitable because market rents may not increase sufficiently to compensate for the increase in construction costs  we may be unable to obtain or face delays in obtaining required zoning landuse building occupancy and other governmental permits and authorizations which could result in increased costs and could require us to abandon our activities entirely with respect to a project  we may abandon development opportunities after we begin to explore them and as a result we may lose deposits or fail to recover expenses already incurred  we may expend funds on and devote managements time to projects that we do not complete  we may be unable to complete construction andor leasing of a property on schedule or at all and  we may suspend development projects after construction has begun due to changes in economic conditions or other factors and this may result in the writeoff of costs payment of additional costs or increases in overall costs when the development project is restarted Investment returns from our developed properties may be less than anticipated Our developed properties may be exposed to the following risks  we may lease developed properties at rental rates that are less than the rates projected at the time we decide to undertake the development  operating expenses and construction costs may be greater than projected at the time of development resulting in our investment being less profitable than we expected and  occupancy rates and rents at newly developed properties may fluctuate depending on a number of factors including market and economic conditions and may result in our investments being less profitable than we expected or not profitable at all We face risks associated with the development of mixeduse commercial properties We operate are currently developing and may in the future develop properties either alone or through joint ventures with other persons that are known as mixeduse developments This means that in addition to the development of office space the project may also include space for residential retail hotel or other commercial purposes We have less experience in developing and managing nonoffice and nonretail real estate than we do with office real estate As a result if a development project includes a nonoffice or nonretail use we may seek to develop that component ourselves sell the rights to that component to a thirdparty developer with experience in that use or we may seek to partner with such a developer If we do not sell the rights or partner with such a developer or if we choose to develop the other component ourselves we would be exposed not only to those risks typically associated with the development of commercial real estate generally but also to specific risks associated with the development and ownership of nonoffice and nonretail real estate In addition even if we sell the rights to develop the other component or elect to participate in the development through a joint venture we may be exposed to the risks associated with the failure of the other party to complete the development as expected These include the risk that the other party would default on its obligations necessitating that we complete the other component ourselves including providing any necessary financing In the case of residential properties these risks include competition for prospective residents from other operators whose properties may be perceived to offer a better location or better amenities or whose rent may be perceived as a better value given the quality location and 20 Table of Contents amenities that the resident seeks We will also compete against condominiums and singlefamily homes that are for sale or rent Because we have less experience with residential properties than with office and retail properties we expect to retain third parties to manage our residential properties If we decide to not sell or participate in a joint venture and instead hire a third party manager we would be dependent on them and their key personnel who provide services to us and we may not find a suitable replacement if the management agreement is terminated or if key personnel leave or otherwise become unavailable to us Our properties face significant competition We face significant competition from developers owners and managers of office and residential properties and other commercial real estate including sublease space available from our tenants Substantially all of our properties face competition from similar properties in the same market This competition may affect our ability to attract and retain tenants and may reduce the rents we are able to charge These competing properties may have vacancy rates higher than our properties which may result in their owners being willing to lease available space at lower rates than the space in our properties We face potential difficulties or delays renewing leases or releasing space We derive most of our income from rent received from our tenants If a tenant experiences a downturn in its business or other types of financial distress including the costs of additional federal state or local tax burdens it may be unable to make timely rental payments Also when our tenants decide not to renew their leases or terminate early we may not be able to relet the space or there could be a substantial delay in reletting the space Even if tenants decide to renew or lease new space the terms of renewals or new leases including the cost of required renovations or concessions to tenants may be less favorable to us than current lease terms As a result our cash flow could decrease and our ability to make distributions to our securityholders could be adversely affected Changes in rent control or rent stabilization and eviction laws and regulations in our markets could have a material adverse effect on our residential portfolios results of operations and residential property values Various state and local governments have enacted and may continue to enact rent control or rent stabilization laws and regulations or take other actions that could limit our ability to raise rents or charge certain fees such as pet fees or application fees We have seen a recent increase in governments considering or being urged by advocacy groups to consider rent control or rent stabilization laws and regulations Depending on the extent and terms of future enactments of rent control or rent stabilization laws and regulations as well as any lawsuits against us arising from such issues such future enactments could have a material adverse effect on our residential portfolios results of operations and the value of our residential properties State and local governments may also make changes to eviction and other tenants rights laws and regulations that could have a material adverse effect on our residential portfolios results of operations and the value of our residential properties If we are restricted from releasing apartment units due to the inability to evict delinquent residents our results of operations and property values for our residential properties may be adversely effected We face potential adverse effects from major tenants bankruptcies or insolvencies The bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant may adversely affect the income produced by our properties Our tenants could file for bankruptcy protection or become insolvent in the future We cannot evict a tenant solely because of its bankruptcy On the other hand a bankrupt tenant may reject and terminate its lease with us In such case our claim against the bankrupt tenant for unpaid and future rent would be subject to a statutory cap that might be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed under the lease and even so our claim for unpaid rent would likely not be paid in full This shortfall could adversely affect our cash flow and results of operations We face the risk that third parties will not be able to service or repay loans we make to them From time to time we have loaned and in the future may loan funds to 1 a thirdparty buyer to facilitate the sale of an asset by us to such third party or 2 a third party in connection with the formation of a joint venture to acquire andor develop a property Making these loans subjects us to the following risks each of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow results of operations andor financial condition 21 Table of Contents  the third party may be unable to make full and timely payments of interest and principal on the loan when due  if the thirdparty buyer to whom we provide seller financing and utilizes the assets as collateral does not manage the property well or the property otherwise fails to meet financial projections performs poorly or declines in value then the buyer may not have the funds or ability to raise new debt with which to make required payments of interest and principal to us  if we loan funds to a joint venture and the joint venture is unable to make required payments of interest or principal or both or there are disagreements with respect to the repayment of the loan or other matters then we could have a resulting dispute with our partners and such a dispute could harm our relationships with our partners and cause delays in developing or selling the property or the failure to properly manage the property and  if we loan funds to a joint venture and the joint venture is unable to make required payments of interest and principal or both then we may exercise remedies available to us in the joint venture agreement that could allow us to increase our ownership interest or our control over major decisions or both which could result in an unconsolidated joint venture becoming consolidated with our financial statement doing so could require us to reallocate the purchase price among the various asset and liability components and this could result in material changes to our reported results of operations and financial condition We face risks associated with the use of debt to fund acquisitions and developments including refinancing risk We are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest We anticipate that only a small portion of the principal of our debt will be repaid prior to maturity Therefore we are likely to need to refinance at least a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures There is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of our existing debt If principal payments due at maturity cannot be refinanced extended or repaid with proceeds from other sources such as new equity capital our cash flow may not be sufficient to repay all maturing debt in years when significant balloon payments come due In addition we may rely on debt to fund a portion of our new investments such as our acquisition and development activity There is a risk that we may be unable to finance these activities on favorable terms or at all These conditions which increase the cost and reduce the availability of debt may continue or worsen in the future We have had and may have in the future agreements with a number of limited partners of BPLP who contributed properties in exchange for partnership interests that require BPLP to maintain for specified periods of time secured debt on certain of our assets andor allocate partnership debt to such limited partners to enable them to continue to defer recognition of their taxable gain with respect to the contributed property These tax protection and debt allocation agreements may restrict our ability to repay or refinance debt As of December 31 2019  we had no tax protection or debt allocation agreement requirements that may restrict our ability to repay or finance debt Adverse economic and geopolitical conditions health crises and dislocations in the credit markets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and ability to pay distributions Our business may be affected by market and economic challenges experienced by the US and global economies or real estate industry as a whole by the local economic conditions in the markets in which our properties are located including the impact of high unemployment volatility in the public equity and debt markets and international economic and other conditions including pandemics These current conditions or similar conditions existing in the future may adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and ability to pay distributions as a result of the following among other potential consequences  the financial condition of our tenants many of which are media and technology financial government legal and other professional firms may be adversely affected which may result in tenant defaults under leases due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity lack of funding operational failures or for other reasons  significant job losses in the financial and professional services industries may occur which may decrease demand for our office space causing market rental rates and property values to be negatively impacted 22 Table of Contents  our ability to borrow on terms and conditions that we find acceptable or at all may be limited which could reduce our ability to pursue acquisition and development opportunities and refinance existing debt reduce our returns from our acquisition and development activities and increase our future interest expense  reduced values of our properties may limit our ability to dispose of assets at attractive prices or to obtain debt financing secured by our properties and may reduce the availability of unsecured loans  the value and liquidity of our shortterm investments and cash deposits could be reduced as a result of a deterioration of the financial condition of the institutions that hold our cash deposits or the institutions or assets in which we have made shortterm investments a dislocation of the markets for our shortterm investments increased volatility in market rates for such investments or other factors  one or more lenders under our line of credit could refuse to fund their financing commitment to us or could fail and we may not be able to replace the financing commitment of any such lenders on favorable terms or at all and  to the extent we enter into derivative financial instruments one or more counterparties to our derivative financial instruments could default on their obligations to us or could fail increasing the risk that we may not realize the benefits of these instruments In addition public health crises pandemics and epidemics such as those caused by the novel coronavirus COVID19 could have a material adverse effect on global national and local economies as well as on our business and our tenants businesses by disrupting supply chains and delaying transactional activities In addition to the potential consequences listed above these same factors may cause prospective tenants to delay their leasing decisions or choose to lease less space The potential impact of a pandemic epidemic or outbreak of a contagious disease on our tenants and our properties is difficult to predict and they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition An increase in interest rates would increase our interest costs on variable rate debt and could adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt or sell assets on favorable terms or at all As of February 21 2020  we had approximately 500 million of outstanding indebtedness excluding our unconsolidated joint ventures that bears interest at variable rates and we may incur more indebtedness in the future If interest rates increase then so would the interest costs on our unhedged variable rate debt which could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt and our ability to make distributions to our securityholders Further rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures or significantly increase our future interest expense From time to time we enter into interest rate swap agreements and other interest rate hedging contracts including swaps caps and floors While these agreements are intended to lessen the impact of rising interest rates on us they also expose us to the risk that the other parties to the agreements will not perform we could incur significant costs associated with the settlement of the agreements the agreements will be unenforceable and the underlying transactions will fail to qualify as highlyeffective cash flow hedges under guidance included in ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging In addition an increase in interest rates could decrease the amounts thirdparties are willing to pay for our assets thereby limiting our ability to change our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions We may be adversely affected by the potential discontinuation of LIBOR In July 2017 the Financial Conduct Authority the FCA announced it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021 As a result the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York organized the Alternative Reference Rates Committee which identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR as its preferred alternative to USDLIBOR We are not able to predict when LIBOR will cease to be published or precisely how SOFR will be calculated and published Any changes adopted by the FCA or other governing bodies in the method used for determining LIBOR may result in a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in reported LIBOR If that were to occur our interest payments could change In addition uncertainty about the extent and manner of future changes may result in interest rates andor payments that are higher or lower than if LIBOR were to remain available in its current form We have contracts that are indexed to LIBOR and are monitoring and evaluating the related risks which include interest amounts on our variable rate debt our unconsolidated joint ventures variable rate debt and the swap rate for our unconsolidated joint ventures interest rate swaps In the event that LIBOR is discontinued the interest rates will be based on an alternative variable rate specified in the applicable documentation governing such 23 Table of Contents debt or swaps or as otherwise agreed upon Such an event would not affect our ability to borrow or maintain already outstanding borrowings or swaps but the alternative variable rate could be higher and more volatile than LIBOR prior to its discontinuance Certain risks arise in connection with transitioning contracts to an alternative variable rate including any resulting value transfer that may occur The value of loans securities or derivative instruments tied to LIBOR could also be impacted if LIBOR is limited or discontinued For some instruments the method of transitioning to an alternative rate may be challenging as they may require substantial negotiation with each respective counterparty If a contract is not transitioned to an alternative variable rate and LIBOR is discontinued the impact is likely to vary by contract If LIBOR is discontinued or if the method of calculating LIBOR changes from its current form interest rates on our current or future indebtedness may be adversely affected While we expect LIBOR to be available in substantially its current form until the end of 2021 it is possible that LIBOR will become unavailable prior to that point This could result for example if sufficient banks decline to make submissions to the LIBOR administrator In that case the risks associated with the transition to an alternative variable rate will be accelerated and magnified Covenants in our debt agreements could adversely affect our financial condition The mortgages on our properties contain customary covenants such as those that limit our ability without the prior consent of the lender to further mortgage the applicable property or to modify or discontinue insurance coverage Our unsecured credit facility unsecured debt securities and certain secured loans contain customary restrictions requirements and other limitations on our ability to incur indebtedness including total debt to asset ratios secured debt to total asset ratios debt service coverage ratios and minimum ratios of unencumbered assets to unsecured debt which we must maintain Our continued ability to borrow under our credit facilities is subject to compliance with our financial and other covenants In addition our failure to comply with such covenants could cause a default under the applicable debt agreement and we may then be required to repay such debt with capital from other sources Under those circumstances other sources of capital may not be available to us or be available only on unattractive terms Additionally in the future our ability to satisfy current or prospective lenders insurance requirements may be adversely affected if lenders generally insist upon greater insurance coverage against acts of terrorism or losses resulting from earthquakes than is available to us in the marketplace or on commercially reasonable terms We rely on debt financing including borrowings under our unsecured credit facility issuances of unsecured debt securities and debt secured by individual properties to finance our existing portfolio our acquisition and development activities and for working capital If we are unable to obtain debt financing from these or other sources or to refinance existing indebtedness upon maturity our financial condition and results of operations would likely be adversely affected If we breach covenants in our debt agreements the lenders can declare a default and if the debt is secured can take possession of the property securing the defaulted loan In addition our unsecured debt agreements contain specific crossdefault provisions with respect to specified other indebtedness giving the unsecured lenders the right to declare a default if we are in default under other loans in some circumstances Defaults under our debt agreements could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations Our degree of leverage could limit our ability to obtain additional financing or affect the market price of our equity and debt securities As of February 21 2020  our Consolidated Debt was approximately 119 billion excluding unconsolidated joint venture debt 24 Table of Contents The following table presents Consolidated Market Capitalization as well as the corresponding ratios of

between 2018 and 2020 Our degree of leverage could affect our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions development or other general corporate purposes Our senior unsecured debt is currently rated investment grade by two major rating agencies However there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain this rating and in the event our senior debt is downgraded from its current rating we would likely incur higher borrowing costs andor difficulty in obtaining additional financing Our degree of leverage could also make us more vulnerable to a downturn in business or the economy generally There is a risk that changes in our debt to market capitalization ratio which is in part a function of BXPs stock price or BPLPs ratio of indebtedness to other measures of asset value used by financial analysts may have an adverse effect on the market price of our equity or debt securities We face risks associated with property acquisitions We have acquired in the past and intend to continue to pursue the acquisition of properties and portfolios of properties including large portfolios that could increase our size and result in alterations to our capital structure Our acquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks  even if we enter into an acquisition agreement for a property we may be unable to complete that acquisition after making a nonrefundable deposit and incurring certain other acquisitionrelated costs  we may be unable to obtain or assume financing for acquisitions on favorable terms or at all  acquired properties may fail to perform as expected  the actual costs of repositioning redeveloping or maintaining acquired properties may be greater than our estimates  the acquisition agreement will likely contain conditions to closing including completion of due diligence investigations to our satisfaction or other conditions that are not within our control which may not be satisfied  acquired properties may be located in new markets either within or outside the United States where we may face risks associated with a lack of market knowledge or understanding of the local economy lack of business relationships in the area costs associated with opening a new regional office and unfamiliarity with local governmental and permitting procedures 25 Table of Contents  we may acquire real estate through the acquisition of the ownership entity subjecting us to the risks of that entity and  we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions particularly acquisitions of portfolios of properties into our existing operations and this could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition We have acquired in the past and in the future may acquire properties through the acquisition of first mortgage or mezzanine debt Investments in these loans must be carefully structured to ensure that BXP continues to satisfy the various asset and income requirements applicable to REITs If we fail to structure any such acquisition properly BXP could fail to qualify as a REIT In addition acquisitions of first mortgage or mezzanine loans subject us to the risks associated with the borrowers default including potential bankruptcy and there may be significant delays and costs associated with the process of foreclosure on collateral securing or supporting these investments There can be no assurance that we would recover any or all of our investment in the event of such a default or bankruptcy We have acquired in the past and in the future may acquire properties or portfolios of properties through tax deferred contribution transactions in exchange for partnership interests in BPLP This acquisition structure has the effect among others of reducing the amount of tax depreciation we can deduct over the tax life of the acquired properties and typically requires that we agree to protect the contributors ability to defer recognition of taxable gain through restrictions on our ability to dispose of the acquired properties andor the allocation of partnership debt to the contributors to maintain their tax bases These restrictions could limit our ability to sell an asset at a time or on terms that would be favorable absent such restrictions Acquired properties may expose us to unknown liability We may acquire properties or invest in joint ventures that own properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse or with only limited recourse against the prior owners or other third parties with respect to unknown liabilities As a result if a liability were asserted against us based upon ownership of those properties we might have to pay substantial sums to settle or contest it which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow Unknown liabilities with respect to acquired properties might include  liabilities for cleanup of undisclosed environmental contamination  claims by tenants vendors or other persons against the former owners of the properties  liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business and  claims for indemnification by general partners directors officers and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties Competition for acquisitions may result in increased prices for properties We plan to continue to acquire properties as we are presented with attractive opportunities We may face competition for acquisition opportunities with other investors and this competition may adversely affect us by subjecting us to the following risks  we may be unable to acquire a desired property because of competition from other wellcapitalized real estate investors including publicly traded and private REITs institutional investment funds and other real estate investors and  even if we are able to acquire a desired property competition from other real estate investors may significantly increase the purchase price Any future international activities will be subject to special risks and we may not be able to effectively manage our international business We have underwritten and in the future may acquire properties portfolios of properties or interests in real estaterelated entities on a strategic or selective basis in international markets that are new to us If we acquire properties or platforms located in these markets we will face risks associated with a lack of market knowledge and understanding of the local economy forging new business relationships in the area and unfamiliarity with local laws and government and permitting procedures In addition our international operations will be subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad such as possible revisions in tax treaties or other laws and regulations including those governing the taxation of our international income restrictions on the transfer of funds and uncertainty over 26 Table of Contents terrorist activities We cannot predict the likelihood that any of these developments may occur Further we may in the future enter into agreements with nonUS entities that are governed by the laws of and are subject to dispute resolution in the courts of another country or region We cannot accurately predict whether such a forum would provide us with an effective and efficient means of resolving disputes that may arise Investments in international markets may also subject us to risks associated with funding increasing headcount integrating new offices and establishing effective controls and procedures to regulate the operations of new offices and to monitor compliance with US laws and regulations such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign laws and regulations such as the UK Bribery Act We may be subject to risks from potential fluctuations in exchange rates between the US dollar and the currencies of the other countries in which we invest If we invest in countries where the US dollar is not the national currency we will be subject to international currency risks from the potential fluctuations in exchange rates between the US dollar and the currencies of those other countries A significant depreciation in the value of the currency of one or more countries where we have a significant investment may materially affect our results of operations We may attempt to mitigate any such effects by borrowing in the currency of the country in which we are investing and under certain circumstances by hedging exchange rate fluctuations however access to capital may be more restricted or unavailable on favorable terms or at all in certain locations For leases denominated in international currencies we may use derivative financial instruments to manage the international currency exchange risk We cannot assure you however that our efforts will successfully neutralize all international currency risks Our use of joint ventures may limit our flexibility with jointly owned investments In appropriate circumstances we intend to develop acquire and recapitalize properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities We currently have joint ventures that are and are not consolidated within our financial statements Our participation in joint ventures subjects us to risks including but not limited to the following risks that  we could become engaged in a dispute with any of our joint venture partners that might affect our ability to develop finance or operate a property and could lead to the sale of either parties ownership interest or the property  some of our joint ventures are subject to debt and in the current credit markets the refinancing of such debt may require equity capital calls  our joint venture partners may default on their obligations necessitating that we fulfill their obligation ourselves  our joint venture partners may have different objectives than we have regarding the appropriate timing and terms of any sale or refinancing of properties or the commencement of development activities  our joint venture partners may be structured differently than us for tax purposes and this could create conflicts of interest  our joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflicts of interest  our joint ventures may be unable to repay any amounts that we may loan to them and  our joint venture agreements may contain provisions limiting the liquidity of our interest for sale or sale of the entire asset We may have difficulty selling our properties which may limit our flexibility Properties like the ones that we own could be difficult to sell This may limit our ability to change our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions In addition federal tax laws limit our ability to sell properties and this may affect our ability to sell properties without adversely affecting returns to our securityholders These restrictions reduce our ability to respond to changes in the performance of our investments and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 27 Table of Contents Our ability to dispose of some of our properties is constrained by their tax attributes Properties which we developed and have owned for a significant period of time or which we acquired through tax deferred contribution transactions in exchange for partnership interests in BPLP often have low tax bases Furthermore as a REIT BXP may be subject to a 100 prohibited transactions tax on the gain from dispositions of property if BXP is deemed to hold the property primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business unless the disposition qualifies under a safe harbor exception for properties that have been held for at least two years and with respect to which certain other requirements are met The potential application of the prohibited transactions tax could cause us to forego potential dispositions of property or other opportunities that might otherwise be attractive to us or to undertake such dispositions or other opportunities through a taxable REIT subsidiary which would generally result in income taxes being incurred If we dispose of these properties outright in taxable transactions we may be required to distribute a significant amount of the taxable gain to our securityholders under the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code for REITs which in turn would impact our future cash flow and may increase our leverage In some cases without incurring additional costs we may be restricted from disposing of properties contributed in exchange for our partnership interests under tax protection agreements with contributors To dispose of low basis or taxprotected properties efficiently we from time to time use likekind exchanges which are intended to qualify for nonrecognition of taxable gain but can be difficult to consummate and result in the property for which the disposed assets are exchanged inheriting their low tax bases and other tax attributes including tax protection covenants Conflicts of interest exist with holders of interests in BPLP Sales of properties and repayment of related indebtedness will have different effects on holders of interests in BPLP than on BXPs stockholders Some holders of interests in BPLP could incur adverse tax consequences upon the sale of certain of our properties and on the repayment of related debt which differ from the tax consequences to BXP and its stockholders Consequently such holders of partnership interests in BPLP may have different objectives regarding the appropriate pricing and timing of any such sale or repayment of debt While BXP has exclusive authority under the limited partnership agreement of BPLP to determine when to refinance or repay debt or whether when and on what terms to sell a property subject in the case of certain properties to the contractual commitments described below any such decision would require the approval of BXPs Board of Directors While the Board of Directors has a policy with respect to these matters directors and executive officers could exercise their influence in a manner inconsistent with the interests of some or a majority of BXPs stockholders including in a manner which could prevent completion of a sale of a property or the repayment of indebtedness Agreement not to sell some properties We have had and may have in the future agreements with the contributors of some properties that we have acquired in exchange for partnership interests in BPLP pursuant to which we have agreed not to sell or otherwise transfer the properties prior to specified dates in any transaction that would trigger taxable income to the contributor In addition we are responsible for the reimbursement of certain taxrelated costs to the prior owners if the subject properties are sold in a taxable sale In general our obligations to the prior owners are limited in time and only apply to actual damages suffered Also BPLP has had and may have in the future agreements providing prior owners of properties with the right to guarantee specific amounts of indebtedness and in the event that the specific indebtedness they guarantee is repaid or reduced additional andor substitute indebtedness These agreements may hinder actions that BPLP may otherwise desire to take to repay or refinance guaranteed indebtedness because BPLP would be required to make payments to the beneficiaries of such agreements if it violates these agreements Because we own a hotel property we face the risks associated with the hospitality industry The following factors among others are common to the hotel industry and may reduce the receipts generated by our hotel property  our hotel property competes for guests with other hotels a number of which may have greater marketing and financial resources than our hoteloperating business partners  if there is an increase in operating costs resulting from inflation and other factors our hoteloperating business partners may not be able to offset such increase by increasing room rates  our hotel property is subject to the fluctuating and seasonal demands of business travelers and tourism and 28 Table of Contents  our hotel property is subject to general and local economic and social conditions that may affect demand for travel in general including war and terrorism In addition because our hotel property is located in Cambridge Massachusetts it is subject to the Cambridge markets fluctuations in demand increases in operating costs and increased competition from additions in supply We face risks associated with shortterm liquid investments We may invest cash balances in a variety of shortterm investments that are intended to preserve principal value and maintain a high degree of liquidity while providing current income From time to time these investments may include either directly or indirectly  direct obligations issued by the US Treasury  obligations issued or guaranteed by the US Government or its agencies  taxable municipal securities  obligations including certificates of deposit of banks and thrifts  commercial paper and other instruments consisting of shortterm US dollar denominated obligations issued by corporations and banks  repurchase agreements collateralized by corporate and assetbacked obligations  both registered and unregistered money market funds and  other highly rated shortterm securities Investments in these securities and funds are not insured against loss of principal Under certain circumstances we may be required to redeem all or part of our investment and our right to redeem some or all of our investment may be delayed or suspended In addition there is no guarantee that our investments in these securities or funds will be redeemable at par value A decline in the value of our investment or a delay or suspension of our right to redeem may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition Our success depends on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed We depend on the efforts of key personnel particularly Owen D Thomas Chief Executive Officer Douglas T Linde President and Raymond A Ritchey Senior Executive Vice President Among the reasons that Messrs Thomas Linde and Ritchey are important to our success is that each has a national reputation which attracts business and investment opportunities and assists us in negotiations with lenders joint venture partners and other investors If we lost their services our relationships with lenders potential tenants and industry personnel could diminish Our Chief Financial Officer and Regional Managers also have strong reputations Their reputations aid us in identifying opportunities having opportunities brought to us and negotiating with tenants and buildtosuit prospects While we believe that we could find replacements for these key personnel the loss of their services could materially and adversely affect our operations because of diminished relationships with lenders prospective tenants and industry personnel Compliance or failure to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act or other safety regulations and requirements could result in substantial costs The Americans with Disabilities Act generally requires that certain buildings including office buildings residential buildings and hotels be made accessible to disabled persons Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants If under the Americans with Disabilities Act we are required to make substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or more of our properties including the removal of access barriers it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations as well as the amount of cash available for distribution to our securityholders 29 Table of Contents Our properties are subject to various federal state and local regulatory requirements such as state and local fire and life safety requirements If we fail to comply with these requirements we could incur fines or private damage awards We do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements will require significant unanticipated expenditures that will affect our cash flow and results of operations Failure to comply with Federal Government contractor requirements could result in substantial costs and loss of substantial revenue As of December 31 2019  the US Government was our largest tenant by square feet We are subject to compliance with a wide variety of complex legal requirements because we are a Federal Government contractor These laws regulate how we conduct business require us to administer various compliance programs and require us to impose compliance responsibilities on some of our contractors Our failure to comply with these laws could subject us to fines penalties and damages cause us to be in default of our leases and other contracts with the Federal Government and bar us from entering into future leases and other contracts with the Federal Government There can be no assurance that these costs and loss of revenue will not have a material adverse effect on our properties operations or business Some potential losses are not covered by insurance Our property insurance program per occurrence limits are 10 billion for its portfolio insurance program including coverage for acts of terrorism other than nuclear biological chemical or radiological terrorism Terrorism Coverage We also carry 250 million of Terrorism Coverage for 601 Lexington Avenue New York New York 601 Lexington Avenue in excess of the 10 billion of coverage in our property insurance program Certain properties including the General Motors Building located at 767 Fifth Avenue in New York New York 767 Fifth Avenue are currently insured in separate insurance programs The property insurance program per occurrence limits for 767 Fifth Avenue are 1625 billion including Terrorism Coverage We also currently carry nuclear biological chemical and radiological terrorism insurance coverage for acts of terrorism certified under the Federal Terrorism Risk Insurance Act as amended TRIA NBCR Coverage which is provided by IXP as a direct insurer for the properties in our portfolio including 767 Fifth Avenue but excluding certain other properties owned in joint ventures with third parties or which we manage The per occurrence limit for NBCR Coverage is 10 billion Under TRIA after the payment of the required deductible and coinsurance the NBCR Coverage provided by IXP is backstopped by the Federal Government if the aggregate industry insured losses resulting from a certified act of terrorism exceed a program trigger In 2019 the program trigger was 180 million and the coinsurance was 19 however both will increase in subsequent years pursuant to TRIA If the Federal Government pays out for a loss under TRIA it is mandatory that the Federal Government recoup the full amount of the loss from insurers offering TRIA coverage after the payment of the loss pursuant to a formula in TRIA We may elect to terminate the NBCR Coverage if the Federal Government seeks recoupment for losses paid under TRIA if TRIA is not extended after its expiration on December 31 2027 if there is a change in our portfolio or for any other reason We intend to continue to monitor the scope nature and cost of available terrorism insurance We also currently carry earthquake insurance on our properties located in areas known to be subject to earthquakes In addition this insurance is subject to a deductible in the amount of 3 of the value of the affected property Specifically we currently carry earthquake insurance which covers our San Francisco and Los Angeles regions with a 240 million per occurrence limit and a 240 million annual aggregate limit 20 million of which is provided by IXP as a direct insurer The amount of our earthquake insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover losses from earthquakes In addition the amount of earthquake coverage could impact our ability to finance properties subject to earthquake risk We may discontinue earthquake insurance or change the structure of our earthquake insurance program on some or all of our properties in the future if the premiums exceed our estimation of the value of the coverage IXP a captive insurance company which is a whollyowned subsidiary acts as a direct insurer with respect to a portion of our earthquake insurance coverage for our Greater San Francisco and Los Angeles properties and our NBCR Coverage Insofar as we own IXP we are responsible for its liquidity and capital resources and the accounts of IXP are part of our consolidated financial statements In particular if a loss occurs which is covered by our NBCR Coverage but is less than the applicable program trigger under TRIA IXP would be responsible for the full amount of the loss without any backstop by the Federal Government IXP would also be responsible for any recoupment charges by the Federal Government in the event losses are paid out and its insurance policy is maintained after the payout by the Federal Government If we experience a loss and IXP is required to pay under its insurance policy we would ultimately record the loss to the extent of the required payment Therefore insurance 30 Table of Contents coverage provided by IXP should not be considered as the equivalent of thirdparty insurance but rather as a modified form of selfinsurance In addition BPLP has issued a guarantee to cover liabilities of IXP in the amount of 200 million We continue to monitor the state of the insurance market in general and the scope and costs of coverage for acts of terrorism and California earthquake risk in particular but we cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially reasonable terms in future policy years There are other types of losses such as from wars for which we cannot obtain insurance at all or at a reasonable cost With respect to such losses and losses from acts of terrorism earthquakes or other catastrophic events if we experience a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds policy limits we could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties as well as the anticipated future revenues from those properties Depending on the specific circumstances of each affected property it is possible that we could be liable for mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the property Any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition and results of operations Actual or threatened terrorist attacks may adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and the value of our properties We have significant investments in large metropolitan markets that have been or may be in the future the targets of actual or threatened terrorism attacks including Boston Los Angeles New York San Francisco and Washington DC As a result some tenants in these markets may choose to relocate their businesses to other markets or to lowerprofile office buildings within these markets that may be perceived to be less likely targets of future terrorist activity This could result in an overall decrease in the demand for office space in these markets generally or in our properties in particular which could increase vacancies in our properties or necessitate that we lease our properties on less favorable terms or both In addition future terrorist attacks in these markets could directly or indirectly damage our properties both physically and financially or cause losses that materially exceed our insurance coverage As a result of the foregoing our ability to generate revenues and the value of our properties could decline materially See also  Some potential losses are not covered by insurance  We face risks associated with our tenants and contractual counterparties being designated Prohibited Persons by the Office of Foreign Assets Control Pursuant to Executive Order 13224 and other laws the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the United States Department of the Treasury OFAC maintains a list of persons designated as terrorists or who are otherwise blocked or banned Prohibited Persons OFAC regulations and other laws prohibit conducting business or engaging in transactions with Prohibited Persons the OFAC Requirements Certain of our loan and other agreements require us to comply with OFAC Requirements We have established a compliance program whereby tenants and others with whom we conduct business are checked against the OFAC list of Prohibited Persons prior to entering into any agreement and on a periodic basis thereafter Our leases and other agreements in general require the other party to comply with OFAC Requirements If a tenant or other party with whom we contract is placed on the OFAC list we may be required by the OFAC Requirements to terminate the lease or other agreement Any such termination could result in a loss of revenue or a damage claim by the other party that the termination was wrongful We face possible risks associated with the physical effects of climate change The physical effects of climate change could have a material adverse effect on our properties operations and business For example many of our properties are located along the East and West coasts particularly those in the central business districts of Boston Los Angeles New York San Francisco and Washington DC To the extent climate change causes changes in weather patterns our markets could experience increases in storm intensity extreme temperatures rising sealevels andor drought Over time these conditions could result in declining demand for office space in our buildings or costs associated with infrastructurerelated remediation projects Climate change may also have indirect effects on our business by making property insurance unavailable or by increasing the cost of i property insurance on terms we find acceptable ii real estate taxes or other assessments iii energy and iv snow removal at our properties There can be no assurance that climate change will not have a material adverse effect on our properties operations or business For additional discussion regarding our approach to climate resiliency and our continued commitment to transparent reporting of ESG performance indicators see  Item 1 BusinessBusiness and Growth StrategiesPolicies with Respect to Certain ActivitiesSustainability  and our annual sustainability report available on our website at httpwwwbxpcom under the heading Sustainability 31 Table of Contents Potential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs Under federal state and local environmental laws ordinances and regulations we may be required to investigate and clean up the effects of releases of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products at or migrating from our properties simply because of our current or past ownership or operation of the real estate If unidentified environmental problems arise we may have to make substantial payments which could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to make distributions to our securityholders because as owner or operator we may have to pay for property damage and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred in connection with the contamination the law typically imposes cleanup responsibility and liability regardless of whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the contamination even if more than one person may be responsible for the contamination each person who shares legal liability under the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the cleanup costs and governmental entities and third parties may sue the owner or operator of a contaminated site for damages and costs These costs could be substantial and in extreme cases could exceed the amount of our insurance or the value of the contaminated property We currently carry environmental insurance in an amount and subject to deductibles that we believe are commercially reasonable Specifically we carry a pollution legal liability policy with a 20 million limit per incident and a policy aggregate limit of 40 million The presence or migration of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products or the failure to properly remediate contamination may give rise to thirdparty claims for bodily injury property damage andor response costs and may materially and adversely affect our ability to borrow against sell or rent an affected property In addition applicable environmental laws create liens on contaminated sites in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with contamination Changes in laws regulations and practices and their implementation increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing at our properties or increasing the restrictions on the handling storage or discharge of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products or other actions may result in significant unanticipated expenditures Environmental laws also govern the presence maintenance and removal of asbestos and other building materials For example laws require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos  properly manage and maintain the asbestos  notify and train those who may come into contact with asbestos and  undertake special precautions including removal or other abatement if asbestos would be disturbed during renovation or demolition of a building Such laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos fibers Some of our properties are located in urban and previously developed areas where fill or current or historic industrial uses of the areas have caused site contamination It is our policy to retain independent environmental consultants to conduct or update Phase I environmental site assessments and asbestos surveys with respect to our acquisition of properties These assessments generally include a visual inspection of the properties and the surrounding areas an examination of current and historical uses of the properties and the surrounding areas and a review of relevant state federal and historical documents but do not involve invasive techniques such as soil and ground water sampling Where appropriate on a propertybyproperty basis our practice is to have these consultants conduct additional testing including sampling for asbestos for lead and other contaminants in drinking water and for soil andor groundwater contamination where underground storage tanks are or were located or where other past site usage creates a potential environmental problem Even though these environmental assessments are conducted there is still the risk that  the environmental assessments and updates did not identify or properly address all potential environmental liabilities  a prior owner created a material environmental condition that is not known to us or the independent consultants preparing the assessments  new environmental liabilities have developed since the environmental assessments were conducted and 32 Table of Contents  future uses or conditions such as changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations could result in environmental liability for us Inquiries about indoor air quality may necessitate special investigation and depending on the results remediation beyond our regular indoor air quality testing and maintenance programs Indoor air quality issues can stem from inadequate ventilation chemical contaminants from indoor or outdoor sources and biological contaminants such as molds pollen viruses and bacteria Indoor exposure to chemical or biological contaminants above certain levels can be alleged to be connected to allergic reactions or other health effects and symptoms in susceptible individuals If these conditions were to occur at one of our properties we may be subject to thirdparty claims for personal injury or may need to undertake a targeted remediation program including without limitation steps to increase indoor ventilation rates and eliminate sources of contaminants Such remediation programs could be costly necessitate the temporary relocation of some or all of the propertys tenants or require rehabilitation of the affected property We face risks associated with security breaches through cyber attacks cyber intrusions or otherwise as well as other significant disruptions of our information technology IT networks and related systems We face risks associated with security breaches whether through cyber attacks or cyber intrusions over the Internet malware computer viruses attachments to emails persons inside our organization or persons with access to systems inside our organization and other significant disruptions of our IT networks and related systems The risk of a security breach or disruption particularly through cyber attack or cyber intrusion including by computer hackers foreign governments and cyber terrorists has generally increased as the number intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased Our IT networks and related systems are essential to the operation of our business and our ability to perform daytoday operations including managing our building systems and in some cases may be critical to the operations of certain of our tenants Although we make efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of IT networks and related systems and we have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging Even the most wellprotected information networks systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because the techniques used in such attempted security breaches evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target and in some cases are designed not be detected and in fact may not be detected Accordingly we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures and thus it is impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk A security breach or other significant disruption involving our IT networks and related systems could  disrupt the proper functioning of our networks and systems and therefore our operations andor those of certain of our tenants  result in misstated financial reports violations of loan covenants missed reporting deadlines andor missed permitting deadlines  result in our inability to properly monitor our compliance with the rules and regulations regarding BXPs qualification as a REIT  result in the unauthorized access to and destruction loss theft misappropriation or release of proprietary confidential sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours or others which others could use to compete against us or which could expose us to damage claims by thirdparties for disruptive destructive or otherwise harmful purposes and outcomes  result in our inability to maintain the building systems relied upon by our tenants for the efficient use of their leased space  require significant management attention and resources to remedy any damages that result  subject us to claims for breach of contract damages credits penalties or termination of leases or other agreements and  damage our reputation among our tenants and investors generally 33 Table of Contents Any or all of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows We did not obtain new owners title insurance policies in connection with properties acquired during BXPs initial public offering We acquired many of our properties from our predecessors at the completion of BXPs initial public offering in June 1997 Before we acquired these properties each of them was insured by a title insurance policy We did not obtain new owners title insurance policies in connection with the acquisition of these properties To the extent we have financed properties after acquiring them in connection with the initial public offering we have obtained new title insurance policies however the amount of these policies may be less than the current or future value of the applicable properties Nevertheless because in many instances we acquired these properties indirectly by acquiring ownership of the entity that owned the property and those owners remain in existence as our subsidiaries some of these title insurance policies may continue to benefit us Many of these title insurance policies may be for amounts less than the current or future values of the applicable properties If there was a title defect related to any of these properties or to any of the properties acquired at the time of the initial public offering of BXP that is no longer covered by a title insurance policy we could lose both our capital invested in and our anticipated profits from such property We have obtained title insurance policies for all properties that we have acquired after the initial public offering of BXP however these policies may be for amounts less than the current or future values of the applicable properties We may be subject to adverse legislative or regulatory tax changes that could negatively impact our financial condition At any time the US federal income tax laws governing REITs or the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended including with respect to our hotel ownership structure We cannot predict if or when any new US federal income tax law regulation or administrative interpretation or any amendment to any existing US federal income tax law Treasury regulation or administrative interpretation will be adopted promulgated or become effective and any such law regulation or interpretation may take effect retroactively BXP its taxable REIT subsidiaries and our securityholders could be adversely affected by any such change in or any new US federal income tax law Treasury regulation or administrative interpretation The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 the TCJA signed into law on December 22 2017 represents sweeping tax reform legislation that makes significant changes to corporate and individual tax rates and the calculation of taxes While we currently do not expect the TCJA will have a significant direct impact on us it may impact us indirectly as our tenants and the jurisdictions in which we do business as well as the overall investment thesis for REITs may be impacted both positively and negatively in ways that are difficult to predict Additionally the overall impact of the TCJA depends on future interpretations and regulations that may be issued by federal tax authorities as well as changes in state and local taxation in response to the TCJA and it is possible that such future interpretations regulations and other changes could adversely impact us We face possible adverse state local tax audits and changes in state and local tax law Because BXP is organized and qualifies as a REIT it is generally not subject to federal income taxes but we are subject to certain state and local taxes In the normal course of business certain entities through which we own real estate either have undergone or are currently undergoing tax audits Although we believe that we have substantial arguments in favor of our positions in the ongoing audits in some instances there is no controlling precedent or interpretive guidance on the specific point at issue Collectively tax deficiency notices received to date from the jurisdictions conducting the ongoing audits have not been material However there can be no assurance that future audits will not occur with increased frequency or that the ultimate result of such audits will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations From time to time changes in state and local tax laws or regulations are enacted which may result in an increase in our tax liability A shortfall in tax revenues for states and municipalities in which we operate may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes If such changes occur we may be required to pay additional taxes on our assets or income These increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and the amount of cash available for the payment of dividends and distributions to our securityholders 34 Table of Contents Litigation could have a material adverse effect From time to time we are involved in legal proceedings and other claims We may also be named as defendants in lawsuits allegedly arising out of our actions or the actions of our vendors contractors tenants or other contractual parties in which such parties have agreed to indemnify defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective businesses andor added as an additional insured under certain insurance policies An unfavorable resolution of any legal proceeding or other claim could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results from operations Regardless of its outcome legal proceedings and other claims may result in substantial costs and expenses and significantly divert the attention of our management With respect to any legal proceeding or other claim there can be no assurance that we will be able to prevail or achieve a favorable settlement or outcome or that our insurance or the insurance andor any contractual indemnities of our vendors contractors tenants or other contractual parties will be enough to cover all of our defense costs or any resulting liabilities Changes in accounting pronouncements could adversely affect our operating results in addition to the reported financial performance of our tenants Accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations Uncertainties posed by various initiatives of accounting standardsetting by the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission which create and interpret applicable accounting standards for US companies may change the financial accounting and reporting standards or their interpretation and application of these standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements Changes include but are not limited to changes in revenue recognition lease accounting and the adoption of accounting standards likely to require the increased use of fairvalue measures These changes could have a material impact on our reported financial condition and results of operations In some cases we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively resulting in potentially material restatements of prior period financial statements Similarly these changes could have a material impact on our tenants reported financial condition or results of operations or could affect our tenants preferences regarding leasing real estate Failure to qualify as a REIT would cause BXP to be taxed as a corporation which would substantially reduce funds available for payment of dividends If BXP fails to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes it will be taxed as a corporation unless certain relief provisions apply We believe that BXP is organized and qualified as a REIT and intends to operate in a manner that will allow BXP to continue to qualify as a REIT However we cannot assure you that BXP is qualified as such or that it will remain qualified as such in the future This is because qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code as to which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of facts and circumstances not entirely within our control Future legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly change the tax laws or the application of the tax laws with respect to qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification In addition we currently hold certain of our properties through subsidiaries that have elected to be taxed as REITs and we may in the future determine that it is in our best interests to hold one or more of our other properties through one or more subsidiaries that elect to be taxed as REITs If any of these subsidiaries fails to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes then BXP may also fail to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes If BXP or any of its subsidiaries that are REITs fails to qualify as a REIT then unless certain relief provisions apply it will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available for payment of dividends for each of the years involved because  BXP would not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to stockholders in computing its taxable income and would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates  BXP also could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax for tax years ending before January 1 2018 and possibly increased state and local taxes and  unless BXP is entitled to relief under statutory provisions BXP could not elect to be subject to tax as a REIT for four taxable years following the year during which it was disqualified 35 Table of Contents In addition if BXP fails to qualify as a REIT and the relief provisions do not apply it will no longer be required to pay dividends As a result of all these factors BXPs failure to qualify as a REIT could impair our ability to raise capital and expand our business and it would adversely affect the value of BXPs common stock If BXP or any of its subsidiaries that are REITs fails to qualify as a REIT but is eligible for certain relief provisions then it may retain its status as a REIT but may be required to pay a penalty tax which could be substantial In order to maintain BXPs REIT status we may be forced to borrow funds during unfavorable market conditions In order to maintain BXPs REIT status we may need to borrow funds on a shortterm basis to meet the REIT distribution requirements even if the thenprevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings To qualify as a REIT BXP generally must distribute to its stockholders at least 90 of its taxable income each year excluding capital gains and with certain other adjustments In addition BXP will be subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax on the amount if any by which dividends paid in any calendar year are less than the sum of 85 of ordinary income 95 of capital gain net income and 100 of undistributed income from prior years We may need shortterm debt or longterm debt or proceeds from asset sales creation of joint ventures or sales of common stock to fund required distributions as a result of differences in timing between the actual receipt of income and the recognition of income for federal income tax purposes or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments Any inability of our cash flows to cover our distribution requirements could have an adverse impact on our ability to raise short and longterm debt or sell equity securities in order to fund distributions required to maintain BXPs REIT status Limits on changes in control may discourage takeover attempts beneficial to stockholders Provisions in BXPs charter and bylaws BXPs shareholder rights agreement and the limited partnership agreement of BPLP as well as provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and Delaware corporate law may  delay or prevent a change of control over BXP or a tender offer even if such action might be beneficial to BXPs stockholders and  limit BXPs stockholders opportunity to receive a potential premium for their shares of common stock over thenprevailing market prices Stock Ownership Limit To facilitate maintenance of BXPs qualification as a REIT and to otherwise address concerns relating to concentration of stock ownership BXPs charter generally prohibits ownership directly indirectly or beneficially by any single stockholder of more than 66 of the number of outstanding shares of any class or series of its common stock We refer to this limitation as the ownership limit BXPs Board of Directors may waive in its sole discretion or modify the ownership limit with respect to one or more persons if it is satisfied that ownership in excess of this limit will not jeopardize BXPs status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes In addition under BXPs charter each of Mortimer B Zuckerman and the respective families and affiliates of Mortimer B Zuckerman and Edward H Linde as well as in general pension plans and mutual funds may actually and beneficially own up to 15 of the number of outstanding shares of any class or series of BXPs equity common stock Shares owned in violation of the ownership limit will be subject to the loss of rights to distributions and voting and other penalties The ownership limit may have the effect of inhibiting or impeding a change in control BPLPs Partnership Agreement BXP has agreed in the limited partnership agreement of BPLP not to engage in specified extraordinary transactions including among others business combinations unless limited partners of BPLP other than BXP receives or have the opportunity to receive either 1 the same consideration for their partnership interests as holders of BXP common stock in the transaction or 2 limited partnership units that among other things would entitle the holders upon redemption of these units to receive shares of common equity of a publicly traded company or the same consideration as holders of BXP common stock received in the transaction If these limited partners would not receive such consideration we cannot engage in the transaction unless limited partners holding at least 75 of the common units of limited partnership interest other than those held by BXP or its affiliates consent to the transaction In addition BXP has agreed in the limited partnership agreement of BPLP that it will not complete specified extraordinary transactions including among others business combinations in which BXP receive the approval of its common stockholders unless 1 limited partners holding at least 75 of the common units of limited partnership interest other than those held by BXP or its affiliates consent to the transaction or 2 36 Table of Contents the limited partners of BPLP are also allowed to vote and the transaction would have been approved had these limited partners been able to vote as common stockholders on the transaction Therefore if BXPs common stockholders approve a specified extraordinary transaction the partnership agreement requires the following before it can complete the transaction  holders of partnership interests in BPLP including BXP must vote on the matter  BXP must vote its partnership interests in the same proportion as its stockholders voted on the transaction and  the result of the vote of holders of partnership interests in BPLP must be such that had such vote been a vote of stockholders the business combination would have been approved With respect to specified extraordinary transactions BXP has agreed in BPLPs partnership agreement to use its commercially reasonable efforts to structure such a transaction to avoid causing its limited partners to recognize gain for federal income tax purposes by virtue of the occurrence of or their participation in such a transaction As a result of these provisions a potential acquirer may be deterred from making an acquisition proposal and BXP may be prohibited by contract from engaging in a proposed extraordinary transaction including a proposed business combination even though BXP stockholders approve of the transaction Changes in market conditions could adversely affect the market price of BXPs common stock As with other publicly traded equity securities the value of BXPs common stock depends on various market conditions that may change from time to time Among the market conditions that may affect the value of BXPs common stock are the following  the extent of investor interest in our securities  the general reputation of REITs and the attractiveness of our equity securities in comparison to other equity securities including securities issued by other real estatebased companies  our underlying asset value  investor confidence in the stock and bond markets generally  national economic conditions  changes in tax laws  our financial performance  changes in our credit ratings and  general stock and bond market conditions including changes in interest rates The market value of BXPs common stock is based primarily upon the markets perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and cash dividends Consequently BXPs common stock may trade at prices that are greater or less than BXPs net asset value per share of common stock If our future earnings or cash dividends are less than expected it is likely that the market price of BXPs common stock will diminish Further issuances of equity securities may be dilutive to current securityholders The interests of our existing securityholders could be diluted if additional equity securities are issued to finance future developments acquisitions or repay indebtedness Our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt financing including unsecured lines of credit and other forms of secured and unsecured debt and equity financing including common and preferred equity The number of shares available for future sale could adversely affect the market price of BXPs stock In connection with and subsequent to BXPs initial public offering we have completed many private placement transactions in which shares of stock of BXP or partnership interests in BPLP were issued to owners of properties we acquired or to institutional investors This common stock or common stock issuable in exchange for such partnership interests in BPLP may be sold in the public securities markets over time under registration rights we 37 Table of Contents granted to these investors Additional common stock issuable under our employee benefit and other incentive plans including as a result of the grant of stock options and restricted equity securities may also be sold in the market at some time in the future Future sales of BXP common stock in the market could adversely affect the price of its common stock We cannot predict the effect the perception in the market that such sales may occur will have on the market price of BXPs common stock We may change our policies without obtaining the approval of our stockholders Our operating and financial policies including our policies with respect to acquisitions of real estate growth operations indebtedness capitalization and dividends are exclusively determined by BXPs Board of Directors Accordingly our securityholders do not control these policies Item 1B Unresolved Staff Comments None 38 Table of
