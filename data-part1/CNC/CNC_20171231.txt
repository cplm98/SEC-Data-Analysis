PART I ITEM 1 Business OVERVIEW We are a diversified multinational healthcare enterprise that provides a portfolio of services to government sponsored and commercial healthcare programs focusing on underinsured and uninsured individuals We provide memberfocused services through locally based staff by assisting in accessing care coordinating referrals to related health and social services and addressing member concerns and questions We also provide education and outreach programs to inform and assist members in accessing quality appropriate healthcare services We believe our local approach including member and provider services enables us to provide accessible quality culturallysensitive healthcare coverage to our communities Our health management educational and other initiatives are designed to help members best utilize the healthcare system to ensure they receive appropriate medically necessary services and effective management of routine severe and chronic health problems resulting in better health outcomes We combine our decentralized local approach for care with a centralized infrastructure of support functions such as finance information systems and claims processing In September 2017 we signed a definitive agreement under which Fidelis Care will become our health plan in New York State Under the terms of the agreement we will acquire substantially all of the assets of Fidelis Care for 375 billion  subject to certain adjustments We operate in two segments Managed Care and Specialty Services Our Managed Care segment provides health plan coverage to individuals through government subsidized and commercial programs including Medicaid the State Childrens Health Insurance Program CHIP LongTerm Services and Supports LTSS Medicare Foster Care Supplemental Security Income Program also known as the Aged Blind or Disabled or collectively ABD and MedicareMedicaid Plans MMP which cover beneficiaries who are dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid In addition our commercial operations which include our members through the Health Insurance Marketplace are included within the Managed Care segment Our Specialty Services segment consists of our specialty companies offering diversified healthcare services and products to state programs correctional facilities healthcare organizations employer groups military service members and their families and other commercial organizations as well as to our own subsidiaries For the year ended December 31 2017  our Managed Care and Specialty Services segments accounted for 95 and 5  respectively of our total external revenues Our membership totaled 122 million as of December 31 2017  For the year ended December 31 2017  our total revenues and net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Centene were 484 billion and 828 million  respectively and our total cash flow from operations was 15 billion  Our initial health plan commenced operations in Wisconsin in 1984 We were organized in Wisconsin in 1993 as a holding company for our initial health plan and reincorporated in Delaware in 2001 Our corporate office is located at 7700 Forsyth Boulevard St Louis Missouri 63105 and our telephone number is 314 7254477 Our stock is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol CNC INDUSTRY We provide a full spectrum of managed healthcare products and services primarily through Medicaid which includes CHIP LTSS Foster Care ABD and MMP Medicare and commercial products We currently have operations domestically and internationally Medicaid Established in 1965 Medicaid is the largest publicly funded program in the United States and provides health insurance to lowincome families and individuals with disabilities Authorized by Title XIX of the Social Security Act Medicaid is an entitlement program funded jointly by the federal and state governments and administered by the states The majority of funding is provided at the federal level Each state establishes its own eligibility standards benefit packages payment rates and program administration within federal standards As a result there are 56 Medicaid programs  one for each US state each US territory and the District of Columbia Eligibility is based on a combination of household income and assets often determined by an income level relative to the federal poverty level Historically children have represented the largest eligibility group Many states have selected Medicaid managed care as a means of delivering quality healthcare and controlling costs We refer to these states as mandatory managed care states 1 Table of Contents Established in 1972 and authorized by Title XVI of the Social Security Act ABD covers lowincome persons with chronic physical disabilities or behavioral health impairments ABD beneficiaries represent a growing portion of all Medicaid recipients In addition ABD recipients typically utilize more services as a result of their health status The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 created CHIP to help states expand coverage primarily to children whose families earned too much to qualify for Medicaid yet not enough to afford private health insurance Costs related to the largest eligibility group children are primarily composed of pediatrics and family care These costs tend to be more predictable than those associated with other healthcare issues which predominantly affect the adult population LTSS is a Medicaid product that covers InstitutionalResidential Care Nursing Facilities Intermediate Care Facilities and Home and Community Based Services HCBS for beneficiaries requiring assistance with their activities of daily living such as bathing dressing and transferring The most common HCBS services include personal care adult day care nonemergent transportation homedelivered meals and personal emergency response systems LTSS services are provided for individuals requiring nursing home level of care receiving waiver services or entitled to state Medicaid LTSS benefits The largest group receiving LTSS by spending are older individuals and individuals with physical disabilities 98 billion in 2015 followed by individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities 44 billion in 2015 those with serious mental illness andor serious emotional disturbance 9 billion in 2015 and other populations 7 billion in 2015 States are increasingly turning to managed care as a solution to provide coordinated holistic care to their LTSS beneficiaries According to the National Association of States United for Aging and Disabilities 20 states utilize some form of LTSS up from eight in 2004 The majority of youth and children in foster care qualify for Medicaid most commonly through Title IVE of the Social Security Act which provides funding to support safe and stable outofhome care for children who are removed from their homes The federal government has enacted legislation establishing guidelines and requirements for state child welfare agencies related to the health and wellbeing of children in foster care including the provision of grants and technical assistance to enable states to meet these needs and make explicit connections with state Medicaid In addition the Affordable Care Act requires states to make former foster care children eligible for Medicaid until they reach the age of 26 provided that they turned 18 while in foster care and were enrolled in Medicaid at that time CMS estimated the total Medicaid market was approximately 566 billion in 2016 and estimated the market will grow to 929 billion by 2025 Medicaid spending increased by 39 in 2016 and is projected to increase at an average annual rate of 57 between 2017 and 2025 While Medicaid programs have directed funds to many individuals who cannot afford or otherwise maintain health insurance coverage they did not initially address the inefficient and costly manner in which the Medicaid population tends to access healthcare Medicaid recipients in nonmanaged care programs typically have not sought preventive care or routine treatment for chronic conditions such as asthma and diabetes Rather they have sought healthcare in hospital emergency rooms which tends to be more expensive As a result many states have found that the costs of providing Medicaid benefits have increased while the medical outcomes for the recipients remained unsatisfactory We believe recognition of the value of managed care as a means of delivering improved health outcomes for Medicaid beneficiaries and effectively controlling costs will continue to strengthen A growing number of states have mandated that their Medicaid recipients enroll in managed care plans Other states are considering moving to a mandated managed care approach As a result we believe a significant market opportunity exists for managed care organizations with operations and programs focused on the distinct socioeconomic cultural and healthcare needs of the uninsured population and the Medicaid CHIP LTSS Foster Care and ABD populations Medicare We contract with CMS under the Medicare Advantage program to provide Medicare Advantage products directly to Medicare beneficiaries as well as through employer and union groups We provide or arrange healthcare benefits for services normally covered by Medicare plus a broad range of healthcare benefits for services not covered by traditional Medicare usually in exchange for a fixed monthly premium per member from CMS that varies based upon the county in which the member resides demographic factors of the member such as age gender and institutionalized status and the health status of the member Any benefits that are not covered by Medicare may result in an additional monthly premium charged to the enrollee or through portions of payments received from CMS that may be allocated to these benefits according to CMS regulations and guidance Many of our Medicare Advantage members pay no monthly premium to us for these additional benefits 2 Table of Contents We provide a wide range of Medicare products including Medicare Advantage plans with and without prescription drug coverage and Medicare supplement products that supplement traditional feeforservice Medicare coverage Our subsidiaries have a number of contracts with CMS under the Medicare Advantage program authorized under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act A portion of Medicare beneficiaries are dualeligible lowincome seniors and people with disabilities who are enrolled in both Medicaid and Medicare According to CMS there were approximately 107 million dualeligible enrollees in 2017  These dualeligible members may receive assistance from Medicaid for benefits such as nursing home care HCBS andor assistance with Medicare premiums and cost sharing Dualeligibles also use more services due to their tendency to have more chronic health issues We serve dualeligibles through our ABD LTSS MMP and Medicare Advantage Dual Special Needs Plan lines of business CMS developed the Medicare Advantage Star ratings system to help consumers choose among competing plans awarding between 10 and 50 stars to Medicare Advantage plans based on performance in certain measures of quality The Star ratings are used by CMS to award quality bonus payments to Medicare Advantage plans Beginning with the 2014 Star ratings calculated in 2013 Medicare Advantage plans are required to achieve a minimum of 40 Stars to qualify for a quality bonus payment The methodology and measures included in the Star ratings system can be modified by CMS annually and Star ratings thresholds are based on performance of Medicare Advantage plans nationally CMS estimated the total Medicare market was approximately 679 billion in 2016 and estimate the market will grow to approximately 13 trillion by 2025 Medicare spending increased 51 in fiscal 2016 and is projected to increase at an average annual rate of 73 between 2017 and 2025 Commercial W e offer commercial healthcare products to individuals and large and small employer groups as well as products to individuals through the Health Insurance Marketplace Our health maintenance organization HMO plans offer comprehensive benefits generally for a fixed fee or premium that does not vary with the extent or frequency of medical services actually received by the member We offer HMO plans with differing benefit designs and varying levels of copayments at different premium rates These plans are offered generally through contracts with participating network physicians hospitals and other providers When an individual enrolls in one of our HMO plans he or she selects a primary care physician PCP from among the physicians participating in our network Our preferred provider organization PPO plans offer coverage for services received from any healthcare provider with benefits generally paid at a higher level when care is received from a participating network provider Coverage typically is subject to deductibles and copayments or coinsurance Our point of service POS plans and our elect open access EOA plans blend the characteristics of HMO PPO and indemnity plans Members can have comprehensive HMOstyle benefits for services received from participating network providers with lower copayments particularly within the medical group but also have coverage generally at higher copayment or coinsurance levels or with coverage limitations for services received outside the network Our Exclusive Provider Organization EPO plans and Healthcare Service Plans HSPs similarly blend elements of traditional HMO and PPO plans In 2010 the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the accompanying Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act collectively referred to as the Affordable Care Act ACA were enacted While the constitutionality of the ACA was subsequently challenged in a number of legal actions in June 2012 the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the ACA with one limited exception relating to the Medicaid expansion provision Medicaid Expansion The Supreme Court held that states could not be required to expand Medicaid and risk losing all federal money for their existing Medicaid programs Under the ACA Medicaid coverage was expanded to all individuals under age 65 with incomes up to 138 of the federal poverty level beginning January 1 2014 subject to the states elections The federal government paid the entire costs for Medicaid Expansion coverage for newly eligible beneficiaries from 2014 through 2016 and 95 of the costs in 2017 Assuming that the current program remains in effect unchanged in 2018 the federal share is scheduled to decline to 94 in 2019 it would be 93 and it would be 90 in 2020 and subsequent years Health Insurance Marketplaces are a key component of the ACA and provide an opportunity for individuals and small businesses to obtain health insurance States have the option of operating their own Marketplace or partnering with the federal government States choosing neither option currently default to a federallyfacilitated Marketplace Premium and cost sharing subsidies are available to make coverage more affordable and access to Marketplaces is limited to US citizens and legal immigrants Insurers are required to offer a minimum level of benefits with coverage that varies based on premiums and outofpocket costs Premium subsidies are provided to families without access to other coverage and with incomes between 100400 of the federal poverty level to help them purchase insurance through the Marketplaces These subsidies are offered on a sliding scale basis 3 Table of Contents International We currently have a growing international presence in Spain and the

as well as Medicare Advantage Through the utilization of a multibusiness line approach we are able to improve the quality of care improve outcomes diversify our revenues and help control our medical costs  Localized Approach with Centralized Support Infrastructure We take a localized approach to managing our subsidiaries including provider and member services This approach enables us to

education transportation and other member support activities For example our community outreach programs work with our members and their communities to promote health and selfimprovement through education on how best to access care We complement this localized approach with a centralized infrastructure of support functions such as finance information systems and claims processing which allows

and Health Insurance Marketplace membership in states in which we currently operate through alliances with key providers outreach efforts development and implementation of communityspecific products and acquisitions For example in 2017 we began providing managed care services to MO HealthNet Managed Care beneficiaries under an expanded statewide contract Also in 2017 we expanded our Medicare Advantage footprint into four of our existing states In 2018 we expanded Medicare Advantage further into nine of our existing states  Diversify Business Lines We seek to broaden our business lines

information systems We engage our executives in the relevant operational units or functional areas to ensure consistency between the diligence and integration process  Address Emerging State Needs We work to assist the states in which we operate in addressing the operating challenges they face We seek to assist the states in balancing premium rates benefit levels member eligibility policies and practices provider compensation and minimizing fraud waste and abuse By helping states structure appropriate programs to cover a wide range of populations including Medicaid CHIP LTSS ABD Intellectual or Developmental Disabilities IDD behavioral health and specialty services among others We seek to ensure that we are able to continue to provide those services on terms that achieve targeted gross margins provide an acceptable return and grow our business 5 Table of Contents  Develop and Acquire Additional Markets We continue to leverage our experience to identify and develop new domestic and international markets by seeking both to acquire existing business and to build our own operations Domestically we focus expansion in states where Medicaid recipients are mandated to enroll in managed care organizations because we believe member enrollment levels are more predictable in these states In addition we provide solutions to states looking to deliver the highest quality of care within their budgetary constraints In 2016 we increased our ownership interest to 75 in The Practice Group Limited TPG one of the largest provider networks for NHS England In 2017 we expanded into Maryland Nebraska and Nevada Also in 2017 we signed a definitive agreement under which Fidelis Care will become our health plan in New York State  Leverage Established Infrastructure to Enhance Operating Efficiencies  We intend to continue to invest in infrastructure to further drive efficiencies in operations and to add functionality to improve the service provided to members and other organizations

team regularly evaluates the financial impact of proposed changes in provider relationships contracts changes in membership and mix of members potential state rate changes and cost reduction initiatives We may divest contracts or health plans in markets where the environment over a longterm basis does not allow us to meet our targeted performance levels For example due to under performance we exited the Arizona individual PPO business effective January 1 2017 In addition in 2016 we took various rate and product design actions for 2017 to address issues and improve profitability in connection with certain lines of business acquired with the Health Net Acquisition Substantially all of our revenues are derived from operations within the United States and its territories and all of our longlived assets are based in the United States and its territories We generally receive a fixed premium per member per month pursuant to our state contracts Our managed care subsidiaries in California and Texas had revenues from their respective state governments that each exceeded 10 of our consolidated total revenues in 2017  In addition the federal government is a significant customer to our Specialty Services segment due to our Federal Services business MANAGED CARE Benefits to Customers We feel that our ability to establish and maintain a leadership position

physicians and hospitals usually are for one to threeyear periods and renew automatically for successive oneyear terms but generally are subject to termination by either party upon prior written notice In the absence of a contract we typically pay providers at applicable state or federal reimbursement levels depending on the product eg Medicaid or Medicare We pay providers under a variety of methods including feeforservice capitation arrangements and valuebased arrangements 9 Table of Contents  Under our feeforservice contracts with providers we pay a negotiated fee for covered services This model is characterized as having no financial risk for the provider  Under our capitated contracts providers can be paid a set amount for their services as outlined in their respective provider agreements A provider groups financial instability or failure to pay secondary providers for services rendered could lead secondary providers to demand payment from us even though we have made our regular capitated payments to the provider group Depending on state law and the regulatory environment it may be necessary for us to pay such claims  Under valuebased arrangements providers are paid under a capitated or feeforservice arrangement The arrangement however contains provisions for additional payments to the providers or reimbursement from the providers based upon cost and quality measures In addition we maintain a network of qualified physicians facilities and ancillary providers in the prime service areas of our TRICARE contract Services are provided on a feeforservice basis

has enabled us to strengthen our provider networks through improved physician recruitment and retention that in turn have helped to increase our membership base The following are among the services we provide to support physicians  Provider Engagement Performance Tools and Processes lead to measurable improvements in quality and health outcomes healthcare costs and member satisfaction High quality and performance levels are important as our key customers are increasingly using performancebased measures to select and pay health plans We have rolled out a suite of network performance tools for use by physicians and other providers which monitor the outcomes and care gaps of their individual patient panel Our specialists meet with the providers to review their performance issues and recommend strategies for improvements in their patient panel outcomes Our tools also allow the physician and others to see where they stand within their valuebased contract  Integrated Care Model is

quality of care in areas that have the greatest impact on our members We employ strategies including health management and complex case management which are adjusted for implementation in our individual markets by a system of physician committees chaired by local physician leaders This process promotes physician participation and support both critical factors in the success of any clinical quality improvement program We have implemented specialized information systems to support our medical quality management activities Information is drawn from our data warehouse clinical databases and our membership and claims processing system to identify opportunities to improve care and to track the outcomes of the interventions implemented to achieve those improvements Some examples of these programs include  use of nationally recognized Interqual or Milliman criteria to help ensure our members receive the right level of care in the most appropriate setting  preauthorized highrisk mediation and services that are commonly over or inappropriately prescribed  member education and the provision of appropriate and easily accessed urgent care services to help members avoid unnecessary and costly emergency room visits and improve their healthcare experience  emphasis on care management and care coordination where clinicians such as nurses and social workers who are employed to assist highrisk and other selected members with the coordination of healthcare services that meet their specific needs  disease management for chronic illnesses such as asthma and diabetes through a comprehensive multidisciplinary and collaborative approach  prenatal case management for women with highrisk pregnancies to help them deliver full healthy infants and  pharmacy treatment compliance programs driven by evidencebased clinical policies and focused on identifying the appropriate medication in the correct dose delivered in an efficient format and utilized for the correct duration We provide reporting on a regular basis using our data warehouse State and Health Employer Data and Information Set HEDIS reporting constitutes the core of the information base that drives our clinical quality performance efforts This reporting is monitored by Plan Quality Improvement Committees and our corporate medical management and quality improvement teams In an effort to ensure the quality of our provider networks we verify the credentials and background of our providers using standards that are supported by the National Committee for Quality Assurance NCQA It is our objective to provide access to the highest quality of care for our members As a validation of that objective we often pursue accreditation by independent organizations that have been established to promote healthcare quality The NCQA Health Plan Accreditation and URAC Health Plan Accreditation programs provide unbiased third party reviews to verify and publicly report results on specific quality care metrics While we have achieved or are pursuing accreditation for all of our plans accreditation is only one measure of our ability to provide access to quality care for our members We currently have NCQA health plan accreditation in 19 of 22 eligible states CMS developed the Medicare Advantage Star ratings system to help consumers choose among competing plans awarding between 10 and 50 stars to Medicare Advantage plans based on performance in certain measures of quality For the 2018 Star rating calculated in 2017 for the quality bonus payment in 2019 our California DSNP Oregon HMO Oregon PPO and Arizona DSNP contracts received 40 out of 50 Stars The California HMO Ohio Texas and Wisconsin DSNPs and Oregon Trillium HMO contracts were measured at 35 Stars and our Arizona HMO and Florida

CORPORATE COMPLIANCE Our Ethics and Compliance program assists the organization in developing effective internal controls that promote prevention and detection of fraud waste and abuse and resolution of instances of conduct that do not conform to federal and state law and private payor healthcare program requirements as well as our own ethics and business policies Responsibilities also include the ongoing maintenance of our privacy program and oversight of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act HIPAA as they pertain to us and our business units from a compliance business and technical perspective Three standards by which corporate compliance programs in the healthcare industry are measured are the Federal Organizational Sentencing Guidelines the CMS Chapter Guidance and the Compliance Program Guidance series issued by the Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General OIG Our program contains each of the seven elements suggested by the Sentencing Guidelines and the OIG guidance These key components are  written standards of conduct  designation of compliance officers and compliance committees  effective training and education  effective lines for reporting and communication  enforcement of standards through well publicized disciplinary guidelines and actions  internal monitoring and auditing and  prompt response to detected

compliance reports on a quarterly basis COMPETITION We operate in a highly competitive environment in an industry subject to ongoing significant changes resulting from the ACA business consolidations new strategic alliances market pressures and regulatory and legislative reform including but not limited to the federal and state healthcare reform legislation described under the heading Regulation In addition changes to the political environment may drive additional changes to the competitive landscape In our business our principal competitors for customers members and providers consist of the following types of organizations   Medicaid Managed Care Organizations that focus on providing healthcare services to Medicaid recipients These organizations consist of national and regional organizations as well as notforprofits and smaller organizations that operate in one city or state and are owned by providers primarily hospitals 13 Table of Contents  National and Regional Commercial Managed Care Organizations that have Medicaid and Medicare members in addition to members in private commercial plans Some of these organizations offer a range of specialty services including pharmacy benefits management behavioral health management health management and nurse triage call support centers  Primary Care Case Management Programs that are established by the states through contracts with primary care providers Under these programs physicians provide primary care services to Medicaid recipients as well as limited medical management oversight  Accountable Care Organizations that consist of groups of doctors hospitals and other healthcare providers who come together to give coordinated high quality care to their patients We compete with other managed care organizations and specialty companies for state federal and commercial contracts In addition the impact of the ACA and potential growth in our segment may attract new competitors including technology companies new joint ventures financial services firms consulting firms and other nontraditional competitors Before granting a contract state and federal government agencies consider many factors These factors include quality of care financial condition stability and resources and established or scalable infrastructure with a demonstrated ability to deliver services and establish adequate provider networks Our specialty companies compete with other providers such as disease management companies individual health insurance companies and pharmacy benefits managers for nongovernmental contracts We also compete to enroll new members and retain existing members People who wish to enroll in a managed healthcare plan or to change healthcare plans typically choose a plan based on the quality of care and services offered ease of access to services a specific provider being part of the network and the availability of supplemental benefits We believe that the principal competitive features affecting our ability to retain and increase membership include the range and prices of benefit plans offered size and quality of provider network quality of service responsiveness to customer demands financial stability comprehensiveness of coverage diversity of product offerings market presence and reputation The relative importance of each of these factors and the identity of our key competitors varies by market and product We believe that we compete effectively against other healthcare industry participants We also compete with other managed care organizations in establishing provider networks When contracting with various health plans we believe that providers consider existing and potential member volume reimbursement rates medical management programs speed of reimbursement and administrative service capabilities See Risk Factors  Competition may limit our ability to increase penetration of the markets that we serve The relative importance of each of the aforementioned competitive factors and the identity of our key competitors varies by market including by geography and by product REGULATION Our operations are comprehensively regulated at local state and federal levels Government regulation of the provision of healthcare products and services is a changing area of law that varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction States have implemented National Association of Insurance Commissioners NAIC model regulations requiring governance practices and risk and solvency assessment reporting States have adopted these or similar measures to enhance regulations relating to corporate governance and internal controls of HMOs and insurance companies We are required to maintain a risk management framework and file reports with state insurance regulators Regulatory agencies generally have substantial discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules Changes in the regulatory environment and applicable laws and rules also may occur periodically including in connection with changes in political party or administration at the state and federal or national levels For example the current administration and certain members of Congress have indicated that they may continue to pursue significant amendments to the ACA Even if the ACA is not amended or repealed the current administration could propose changes impacting implementation of the ACA The ultimate content and timing of any legislation enacted under the current administration that would affect the ACA remains uncertain 14 Table of Contents The ACA transformed the US healthcare system through a series of complex initiatives Some of the ACAs most significant provisions include the imposition of significant fees assessments and taxes including the nondeductible tax technically called a fee on health insurers based on prior year net premiums written the health insurer fee or HIF the establishment of federallyfacilitated and statebased Health Insurance Marketplaces where individuals and small groups may purchase health coverage the implementation of certain premium stabilization programs designed to apportion risk amongst insurers and the optional Medicaid Expansion State and federal regulators have continued to provide additional guidance and specificity to the ACA and we continue to monitor this new information and evaluate its potential impact on our business For a further discussion of the implementation of the ACA as well as the potential repeal of or changes to the ACA see the risk factor below entitled The implementation of Health Reform Legislation as well as potential repeal of or changes to Health Reform Legislation could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows Our regulated subsidiaries are licensed to operate as health maintenance organizations HMOs preferred provider organizations PPOs third party administrators utilization review organizations pharmacies direct care providers andor insurance companies in their respective states In each of the jurisdictions in which we operate we are regulated by the relevant insurance health andor human services departments departments of insurance boards of pharmacy and other healthcare providers and departments of health that oversee the activities of managed care organizations and health plans providing or arranging to provide services to enrollees The process for obtaining authorization to operate as a managed care organization health insurance plan pharmacy or provider organizations is complex and requires us to demonstrate to the regulators the adequacy of the health plans organizational structure financial resources utilization review quality assurance programs proper billing complaint procedures and an adequate provider network and procedures for covering emergency medical conditions For example under both state managed care organization statutes and insurance laws our health plan subsidiaries as well as our applicable specialty companies must comply with minimum statutory capital and other financial solvency requirements such as deposit and surplus requirements Insurance regulations may also require prior state approval of acquisitions of other managed care organization businesses and the payment of dividends as well as notice for loans or the transfer of funds Our subsidiaries are also subject to periodic state and federal reporting requirements In addition each health plan and individual healthcare provider must meet criteria to secure the approval of state regulatory authorities before implementing certain operational changes including without limitation changes to existing offerings the development of new product offerings certain organizational restructurings and in some states the expansion of service areas States have adopted a number of regulations that may affect our business and results of operations These regulations in certain states include  premium taxes or similar assessments imposed on us  stringent prompt payment laws requiring us to pay claims within a specified period of time  disclosure requirements regarding provider fee schedules and coding procedures and  programs to monitor and supervise the activities and financial solvency of provider groups Federal law has also implemented other health programs that are partially funded by the federal government such as the Medicaid program Our Medicaid programs are regulated and administered by various state regulatory bodies Federal funding remains critical to the viability of these programs Federal law permits the federal government to oversee and in some cases to enact regulations and other requirements that must be followed by states with respect to these programs Medicaid is administered at the federal level by CMS Comprehensive legislation specifically Title XVIII of the Social Security Act governs our Medicare program In addition our Medicare contracts are subject to regulation by CMS CMS has the right to audit Medicare contractors and the healthcare providers and administrative contractors who provide certain services on their behalf to determine the quality of care being rendered and the degree of compliance with CMS contracts and regulations We are regulated as an insurance holding company and are subject to the insurance holding company acts of the states in which our insurance company and HMO subsidiaries are domiciled These acts contain certain reporting requirements as well as restrictions on transactions between an insurer or HMO and its affiliates These holding company laws and regulations generally require insurance companies and HMOs within an insurance holding company system to register with the insurance department of each state where they are domiciled and to file with those states insurance departments reports describing capital structure ownership financial condition intercompany transactions and general business operations In addition depending on the size and nature of the transaction there are various notice and reporting requirements that generally apply to transactions between insurance companies and HMOs and their affiliates within an insurance holding company structure Some insurance holding company laws and regulations require prior regulatory approval or in certain circumstances prior notice of certain material intercompany transfers of assets as well as certain transactions between insurance companies HMOs their parent holding companies and affiliates Among other provisions state insurance and HMO laws may restrict the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends 15 Table of Contents Additionally the holding company acts of the states in which our subsidiaries are domiciled restrict the ability of any person to obtain control of an insurance company or HMO without prior regulatory approval Under those statutes without such approval or an exemption no person may acquire any voting security of an insurance holding company which controls an insurance company or HMO or merge with such a holding company if as a result of such transaction such person would control the insurance holding company Control is generally defined as the direct or indirect power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a company and is presumed to exist if a person directly or indirectly owns or controls 10 or more of the voting securities of a company PPO regulation also varies by state and covers all or most of the subject area referred to above Our pharmacies must be licensed to do business as pharmacies in the states in which they are located Our pharmacies must also register with the US Drug Enforcement Administration and individual state controlled substance authorities to dispense controlled substances In many of the states where our pharmacies deliver pharmaceuticals there are laws and regulations that require outofstate mail order pharmacies to register with that states board of pharmacy or similar regulatory body These states generally permit the pharmacy to follow the laws of the state in which the mail order pharmacy is located although some states require that we also comply with certain laws in that state Our healthcare providers must be licensed to practice medicine and do business as care providers in the state in which they are located In addition they must be in good standing with the applicable medical board board of nursing or other applicable entity Furthermore they cannot be excluded from participation at both the state and federal levels Our facilities are periodically reviewed by state departments of health and other regulatory agencies to ensure the environment is safe to provide care We must also comply with laws and regulations related to the award administration and performance of US Government contracts Government contract laws and regulations affect how we do business with our customers and in some instances impose added costs on our business Money laundering is a method of attempting to conceal the origins of money gained through illegal activity and is itself a crime that can result in substantial criminal and civil sanctions including fines and imprisonment To ensure compliance with antimoney laundering laws and regulations it is our policy to conduct business only with legitimate customers and counterparties whose funds are derived from legitimate commercial activity In addition as a result of our international operations we are also subject to the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act FCPA and similar worldwide anticorruption laws including the UK Bribery Act of 2010 which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to nonUS officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business A violation of specific laws and regulations by us andor our agents could result in among other things the imposition of fines and penalties on us changes to our business practices the termination of our contracts or debarment from bidding on contracts State and Federal Contracts In addition to being a licensed insurance company or HMO in order to be a Medicaid managed care organization in each of the states in which we operate we generally must operate under a contract with the states Medicaid agency States generally either use a formal proposal process reviewing a number of bidders or award individual contracts to qualified applicants that apply for entry to the program Under these state Medicaid program contracts we receive monthly payments based on specified capitation rates determined on an actuarial basis These rates differ by membership category and by state depending on the specific benefits and policies adopted by each state In addition several of our Medicaid contracts require us to maintain Medicare Advantage special needs plans which are regulated by CMS for dual eligible individuals within the state We also contract with states to provide healthcare services to correctional facilities We provide Medicare Advantage Dual Eligible Special Needs Plans DSNPs and MedicareMedicaid Plans MMP which are provided under contracts with CMS and subject to federal regulation regarding the award administration and performance of such contracts CMS also has the right to audit our performance to determine our compliance with these contracts as well as other CMS regulations and the quality of care we provide to Medicare beneficiaries under these contracts We additionally provide behavioral and other healthcare services to correctional systems under contracts in certain states which are also subject to state regulation Our government contracts include governmentsponsored managed care and administrative services contracts through the TRICARE program the Department of Defense Military and Family Life Counseling program the US Department of Veterans Affairs Patient Centered Community Care program and certain other healthcarerelated government contracts 16 Table of Contents Our state and federal contracts and the regulatory provisions applicable to us generally set forth the requirements for operating in the Medicaid and Medicare sectors including provisions relating to  eligibility enrollment and disenrollment processes  covered services  eligible providers  subcontractors  recordkeeping and record retention  periodic financial and informational reporting  quality assurance  accreditation  health education and wellness and prevention programs  timeliness of claims payment  financial standards  safeguarding of member information  fraud waste and abuse detection and reporting  grievance procedures  organization and administrative systems A health plan or individual health insurance providers compliance with these requirements is subject to monitoring by state regulators and by CMS A health plan is also subject to periodic comprehensive quality assurance evaluations by a thirdparty reviewing organization and generally by the insurance department of the jurisdiction that licenses the health plan A health plan or individual health insurance provider must also submit reports to various regulatory agencies including quarterly and annual statutory financial statements and utilization reports Our health plans operate through individual state contracts generally with an initial term of one to five years The contracts often have renewal or extension terms or are renewable through the states reprocurement process The contracts generally are subject to termination for cause an event of default or lack of funding among other things Marketplace Contracts We operate in 15 states under federallyfacilitated and statebased Marketplace contracts with CMS that expire annually In 2018 we began operating under Marketplace contracts in Kansas Missouri and Nevada We expect to begin operating under a Marketplace contract in New York pending the closing of the Fidelis Care Transaction We operate under a contract with the Arkansas Department of Human Services Division of Medical Services and the Arkansas Insurance Department to participate in the Medicaid expansion model that Arkansas has adopted referred to as Arkansas Works We also operate under a contract with the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services to participate in the Medicaid expansion model that New Hampshire has adopted referred to as the Premium Assistance Program Privacy Regulations We are subject to various international federal state and local laws and rules regarding the use security and disclosure of protected health information personal information and other categories of confidential or legally protected data that our businesses handle Such laws and rules include without limitation the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act HIPAA the Federal Trade Commission Act the GrammLeachBliley Financial Modernization Act of 1999 GrammLeachBliley Act state privacy and security laws such as the California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act and the California Online Privacy Protection Act Privacy and security laws and regulations often change due to new or amended legislation regulations or administrative interpretation A variety of state and federal regulators enforce these laws including but not limited to the US Department of Health and Human Services HHS the Federal Trade Commission state attorneys general and other state regulators 17 Table of Contents HIPAA is designed to improve the portability and continuity of health insurance coverage simplify the administration of health insurance through standard transactions and ensure the privacy and security of individual health information Among the requirements of HIPAA are the Administrative Simplification provisions which include standards for processing health insurance claims and related transactions Transactions Standards requirements for protecting the privacy and limiting the use and disclosure of medical records and other personal health information Privacy Rule and standards and specifications for safeguarding personal health information which is maintained stored or transmitted in electronic format Security Rule The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health HITECH Act amended certain provisions of HIPAA and enhanced data security obligations for covered entities and their business associates HITECH also mandated individual notifications in instances of a data breach provided enhanced penalties for HIPAA violations and granted enforcement authority to states Attorneys Generals in addition to the HHS Office for Civil Rights The HIPAA Omnibus Rule further enhanced the changes under the HITECH Acts and the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 GINA which clarified that genetic information is protected under HIPAA and prohibits most health plans from using or disclosing genetic information for underwriting purposes This Omnibus rule enhances the privacy protections and strengthens the governments ability to enforce the law These regulations also establish significant criminal penalties and civil sanctions for noncompliance The preemption provisions of HIPAA provide that the federal standards will not preempt state laws that are more stringent than the related federal requirements The Privacy and Security Rules and HITECHOmnibus enhancements established requirements to protect the privacy of medical records and safeguard personal health information maintained and used by healthcare providers health plans healthcare clearinghouses and their business associates The Security Rule requires healthcare providers health plans healthcare clearinghouses and their business associates to implement administrative physical and technical safeguards to ensure the privacy and confidentiality of health information electronically stored maintained or transmitted The HITECH Act and Omnibus Rule enhanced a federal requirement for notification when the security of protected health information is breached In addition there are state laws that have been adopted to provide for among other things private rights of action for breaches of data security and mandatory notification to persons whose identifiable information is obtained without authorization The requirements of the Transactions Standards apply to certain healthcare related transactions conducted using electronic media Since electronic media is defined broadly to include transmissions that are physically moved from one location to another using portable data magnetic tape disk or compact disk media many communications are considered to be electronically transmitted Under HIPAA health plans and providers are required to have the capacity to accept and send all covered transactions in a standardized electronic format Penalties can be imposed for failure to comply with these requirements The transaction standards were modified on October 1 2015 with the implementation of the ICD10 coding system In addition we process and maintain personal card data particularly in connection with our Marketplace business As a result we must maintain compliance with the Payment Card Industry PCI Data Security Standard which is a multifaceted security standard intended to optimize the security of credit debit and cash card transactions and protect cardholders against misuse of their personal information Other Fraud Waste and Abuse Laws Investigating and prosecuting healthcare fraud waste and abuse continues to be a top priority for state and federal law enforcement entities The focus of these efforts has been directed at Medicare Medicaid Health Insurance Marketplace and commercial products The fraud waste and abuse laws include the federal False Claims Act which prohibits the known filing of a false claim or the known use of false statements to obtain payment from the federal government Many states have false claim act statutes that closely resemble the federal False Claims Act The laws and regulations relating to fraud waste and abuse and the requirements applicable to health plans and providers participating in these programs are complex and change regularly Compliance with these laws may require substantial resources We are constantly looking for ways to improve our waste fraud and abuse detection methods While we have both prospective and retrospective processes to identify abusive patterns and fraudulent billing we continue to increase our capabilities to proactively detect inappropriate billing prior to payment EMPLOYEES As of December 31 2017  we had approximately 33700 employees None of our employees are represented by a union We believe our relationships with our employees are positive 18 Table of Contents EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE REGISTRANT The following table sets forth information regarding our executive officers

TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK You should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks in which case you could lose all or part of your investment You should also refer to the other information in this filing including our consolidated financial statements and related notes The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we currently believe may materially affect our Company Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we currently deem immaterial also may become important factors that affect our Company Unless the context otherwise requires the terms the Company we us our or similar terms and Centene i prior to the closing of the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition refer to Centene Corporation together with its consolidated subsidiaries without giving effect to the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition and ii upon and after the closing of the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition refer to us after giving effect to the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition Reductions in funding changes to eligibility requirements for government sponsored healthcare programs in which we participate and any inability on our part to effectively adapt to changes to these programs could substantially affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows The majority of our revenues come from government subsidized healthcare programs including Medicaid Medicare TRICARE VA CHIP LTSS ABD Foster Care and Health Insurance Marketplace premiums Under most programs the base premium rate paid for each program differs depending on a combination of factors such as defined upper payment limits a members health status age gender county or region and benefit mix Since Medicaid was created in 1965 the federal government and the states have shared the costs for this program with the federal share currently averaging around 57 We are therefore exposed to risks associated with US and state government contracting or participating in programs involving a government payor including but not limited to the general ability of the federal andor state government to terminate contracts with it in whole or in part without prior notice for convenience or for default based on performance potential regulatory or legislative action that may materially modify amounts owed and our dependence upon Congressional or legislative appropriation and allotment of funds and the impact that delays in government payments could have on our operating cash flow and liquidity For example future levels of funding and premium rates may be affected by continuing government efforts to contain healthcare costs and may further be affected by state and federal budgetary constraints Governments periodically consider reducing or reallocating the amount of money they spend for Medicaid Medicare TRICARE VA CHIP LTSS ABD and Foster Care Furthermore Medicare remains subject to the automatic spending reductions imposed by the Budget Control Act of 2011 and the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 sequestration subject to a 2 cap In addition reductions in defense spending could have an adverse impact on certain government programs in which we currently participate by among other things terminating or materially changing such programs or by decreasing or delaying payments made under such programs Adverse economic conditions may continue to put pressures on state budgets as tax and other state revenues decrease while the population that is eligible to participate in these programs remains steady or increases creating more need for funding We anticipate this will require government agencies to find funding alternatives which may result in reductions in funding for programs contraction of covered benefits and limited or no premium rate increases or premium rate decreases A reduction or less than expected increase a protracted delay or a change in allocation methodology in government funding for these programs as well as termination of the contract for the convenience of the government may materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows In addition if a federal government shutdown were to occur for a prolonged period of time federal government payment obligations including its obligations under Medicaid Medicare TRICARE VA CHIP LTSS ABD Foster Care and the Health Insurance Marketplaces may be delayed Similarly if state government shutdowns were to occur state payment obligations may be delayed If the federal or state governments fail to make payments under these programs on a timely basis our business could suffer and our financial position results of operations or cash flows may be materially affected Payments from government payors may be delayed in the future which if extended for any significant period of time could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position cash flows or liquidity In addition delays in obtaining or failure to obtain or maintain governmental approvals or moratoria imposed by regulatory authorities could adversely affect our revenues or membership increase costs or adversely affect our ability to bring new products to market as forecasted Other changes to our government programs could affect our willingness or ability to participate in any of these programs or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 20 Table of Contents Finally changes in these programs could reduce the number of persons enrolled in or eligible for these programs or increase our administrative or healthcare costs under these programs For example maintaining current eligibility levels could cause states to reduce reimbursement or reduce benefits in order for states to afford to maintain eligibility levels If any state in which we operate were to decrease premiums paid to us or pay us less than the amount necessary to keep pace with our cost trends it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows Our Medicare programs are subject to a variety of risks that could adversely impact our financial results If we fail to design and maintain programs that are attractive to Medicare participants if our Medicare operations are subject to negative outcomes from program audits sanctions or penalties if we do not submit adequate bids in our existing markets or any expansion markets if our existing contracts are terminated or if we fail to maintain or improve our quality Star ratings our current Medicare business and our ability to expand our Medicare operations could be materially and adversely affected negatively impacting our financial performance As previously announced CMS recently published Medicare Star ratings for the 2018 rating year The achievement of Star ratings of four or higher for the 2018 rating year qualifies Medicare Advantage plans for quality bonus payments in 2019 The results from CMS indicate that Health Net of California Incs Medicare Advantage plan H0562 will move to a 35 Star rating from a 40 Star rating for the 2018 rating year The effect of this Star rating change will lower our parent Star rating for the 2018 rating year from 40 stars to 35 stars and therefore our plans that use the parent rating as well as the Medicare Advantage plan H0562 will not be eligible for the quality bonus payments in 2019 These lowered Star ratings for the 2018 rating year for the Medicare Advantage plan H0562 and the Company may reduce the attractiveness of the affected plans and our other offerings to members reduce revenue from the affected plan and impact our Medicare expansion efforts which are a strategic focus for the Company We continue to evaluate the potential impact of the lowered ratings on our revenues and expansion efforts in 2019 There are also specific additional risks under Title XVIII Part D of the Social Security Act associated with our provision of Medicare Part D prescription drug benefits as part of our Medicare Advantage plan offerings These risks include potential uncollectibility of receivables inadequacy of pricing assumptions inability to receive and process information and increased pharmaceutical costs as well as the underlying seasonality of this business and extended settlement periods for claims submissions Our failure to comply with Part D program requirements can result in financial andor operational sanctions on our Part D products as well as on our Medicare Advantage products that offer no prescription drug coverage Failure to accurately estimate and price our medical expenses or effectively manage our medical costs or related administrative costs could negatively affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows Our profitability to a significant degree depends on our ability to estimate and effectively manage expenses related to health benefits through among other things our ability to contract favorably with hospitals physicians and other healthcare providers For example our Medicaid revenue is often based on bids submitted before the start of the initial contract year If our actual medical expense exceeds our estimates our health benefits ratio HBR or our expenses related to medical services as a percentage of premium revenues would increase and our profits would decline Because of the narrow margins of our health plan business relatively small changes in our HBR can create significant changes in our financial results Changes in healthcare regulations and practices the level of utilization of healthcare services hospital and pharmaceutical costs disasters the potential effects of climate change major epidemics pandemics or newly emergent viruses new medical technologies new pharmaceutical compounds increases in provider fraud and other external factors including general economic conditions such as inflation and unemployment levels are generally beyond our control and could reduce our ability to accurately predict and effectively control the costs of providing health benefits In addition the 2018 marketplace for individual products may continue to be less stable than in previous years because among other things other health plans have changed or stopped offering their Health Insurance Marketplace products in the states we expect to serve in 2018 or have announced plans to change their Health Insurance Marketplace product offerings in 2018 Also member behavior could be influenced by the repeal of the ACAs individual mandate in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 TCJA and further uncertainty surrounding other potential changes to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the accompanying Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act collectively referred to as Affordable Care Act ACA Our medical expense includes claims reported but not paid estimates for claims incurred but not reported and estimates for the costs necessary to process unpaid claims at the end of each period Our development of the medical claims liability estimate is a continuous process which we monitor and refine on a monthly basis as claims receipts and payment information as well as inpatient acuity information becomes available As more complete information becomes available we adjust the amount of the estimate and include the changes in estimates in medical expense in the period in which the changes are identified Given the uncertainties inherent in such estimates there can be no assurance that our medical claims liability estimate will be adequate and any adjustments to the estimate may unfavorably impact our results of operations and may be material 21 Table of Contents Additionally when we commence operations in a new state region or product we have limited information with which to estimate our medical claims liability For a period of time after the inception of the new business we base our estimates on governmentprovided historical actuarial data and limited actual incurred and received claims and inpatient acuity information The addition of new categories of eligible individuals as well as evolving Health Insurance Marketplace plans may pose difficulty in estimating our medical claims liability From time to time in the past our actual results have varied from our estimates particularly in times of significant changes in the number of our members If it is determined that our estimates are significantly different than actual results our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected In addition if there is a significant delay in our receipt of premiums our business operations cash flows or earnings could be negatively impacted The implementation of the ACA as well as potential repeal of or changes to the ACA could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows In March 2010 the ACA was enacted While the constitutionality of the ACA was generally upheld by the Supreme Court in 2012 the Court determined that states could elect to opt out of the Medicaid expansion portion of ACA without losing all federal money for their existing Medicaid programs Under the ACA Medicaid coverage was expanded to all individuals under age 65 with incomes up to 138 of the federal poverty level beginning January 1 2014 subject to each states election The federal government pays the entire costs for Medicaid coverage for newly eligible beneficiaries for three years 2014 through 2016 Beginning in 2017 the federal share begins to decline ending at 90 for 2020 and subsequent years As of December 31 2017 32 states and the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid eligibility and additional states continue to discuss expansion The ACA also maintained CHIP eligibility standards through September 2019 The ACA required the establishment of Health Insurance Marketplaces for individuals and small employers to purchase health insurance coverage The ACA also required insurers participating on the Health Insurance Marketplaces to offer a minimum level of benefits and included guidelines on setting premium rates and coverage limitations On December 22 2017 the TCJA was signed repealing the individual mandate requirement of the ACA beginning in 2019 This change and other potential changes involving the functioning of the Health Insurance Marketplaces as a result of new legislation regulation or executive action could impact our business and results of operations Any failure to adequately price products offered or reduction in products offered in the Health Insurance Marketplaces may have a negative impact on our results of operations financial position and cash flow Among other things due to the repeal of the individual mandate in the TCJA we may be adversely selected by individuals who have higher acuity levels than those individuals who selected us in the past and healthy individuals may decide to opt out of the pool altogether In addition the risk corridor reinsurance and risk adjustment three Rs provisions of the ACA established to apportion risk amongst insurers may not be effective in appropriately mitigating the financial risks related to the Marketplace product Further the three Rs may not be adequately funded Moreover changes in the competitive marketplace over time may exacerbate the uncertainty in these relatively new markets For example competitors seeking to gain a foothold in the changing market may introduce pricing that we may not be able to match which may adversely affect our ability to compete effectively Competitors may also choose to exit the market altogether or otherwise suffer financial difficulty which could adversely impact the pool of potential insured require us to increase premium rates or result in funding issues under the three Rs These potential exits and other continued volatility in this market may be further exacerbated by the conclusion of the risk corridor and reinsurance programs as of January 1 2017 Our continued success in the exchanges is dependent on our ability to successfully respond to these changes in the market over time Any significant variation from our expectations regarding acuity enrollment levels adverse selection the three Rs or other assumptions utilized in setting adequate premium rates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows The US Department of Health and Human Services HHS has stated that it will consider a limited number of premium assistance demonstration proposals from States that want to privatize Medicaid expansion States must provide a choice between at least two qualified health plans and offer very similar benefits as those available in the Health Insurance Marketplaces Arkansas became the first state to obtain federal approval to use Medicaid funding to purchase private insurance for lowincome residents and we began operations under the program beginning January 1 2014 As of December 31 2017 seven states had approved Section 1115 waivers to implement the ACAs Medicaid expansion in ways that extend beyond the flexibility provided by the federal law 22 Table of Contents The ACA imposed an annual insurance industry assessment of 80 billion in 2014 and 113 billion in each of 2015 and 2016 with increasing annual amounts thereafter The health insurer fee payable in 2017 was suspended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2016 However the 143 billion payment resumes in 2018 for the fiscal year 2017 Such assessments are not deductible for federal and most state income tax purposes The fee is allocated based on health insurers premium revenues in the previous year Each health insurers fee is calculated by multiplying its market share by the annual fee Market share is based on commercial Medicare and Medicaid premium revenues Notforprofit insurers may have a competitive advantage since they are exempt from paying the fee if they receive at least 80 of their premium revenues from Medicare Medicaid and CHIP and other notforprofit insurers are allowed to exclude 50 of their premium revenues from the fee calculation If we are not reimbursed by the states for the cost of the federal premium assessment including the associated tax impact or if we are unable to otherwise adjust our business model to address this new assessment our results of operations financial position and cash flows may be materially adversely affected There are numerous steps regulators required for continued implementation of the ACA including the promulgation of a substantial number of new and potentially more onerous federal regulations For example in April 2016 CMS issued final regulations that revised existing Medicaid managed care rules by establishing a minimum MLR standard for Medicaid of 85 and strengthening provisions related to network adequacy and access to care enrollment and disenrollment protections beneficiary support information continued service during beneficiary appeals and delivery system and payment reform initiatives among others If we fail to effectively implement or appropriately adjust our operational and strategic initiatives with respect to the implementation of healthcare reform or do not do so as effectively as our competitors our results of operations may be materially adversely affected In addition House v Hargan previously v Burwell et al and v Price et al  the suit that was brought by House Republicans was settled in December 2017 The new administrations decision to stop the cost sharing subsidies rendered further challenge to the cost sharing subsidy payments unnecessary While 2018 premium rates for Health Insurance Marketplace were set without factoring in the cost sharing subsidy payments from the federal government the new administrations decision to end payments could affect our earnings Changes to or repeal of portions or the entirety of the ACA could materially and adversely affect our business and financial position results of operations or cash flows Even if the ACA is not amended or repealed the new administration could propose changes impacting implementation of the ACA which could materially and adversely affect our financial position or operations However the ultimate content timing or effect of any potential future legislation enacted under the new administration cannot be predicted Our business activities are highly regulated and new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or their enforcement or application could force us to change how we operate and could harm our business Our business is extensively regulated by the states in which we operate and by the federal government In addition the managed care industry has received negative publicity that has led to increased legislation regulation review of industry practices and private litigation in the commercial sector Such negative publicity may adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation in various markets In each of the jurisdictions in which we operate we are regulated by the relevant insurance health andor human services or government departments that oversee the activities of managed care organizations providing or arranging to provide services to Medicaid Medicare Health Insurance Marketplace enrollees or other beneficiaries For example our health plan subsidiaries as well as our applicable specialty companies must comply with minimum statutory capital and other financial solvency requirements such as deposit and surplus requirements The frequent enactment of changes to or interpretations of laws and regulations could among other things force us to restructure our relationships with providers within our network require us to implement additional or different programs and systems restrict revenue and enrollment growth increase our healthcare and administrative costs impose additional capital and surplus requirements and increase or change our liability to members in the event of malpractice by our contracted providers In addition changes in political party or administrations at the state federal or country level may change the attitude towards healthcare programs and result in changes to the existing legislative or regulatory environment Additionally the taxes and fees paid to federal state and local governments may increase due to several factors including enactment of changes to or interpretations of tax laws and regulations audits by governmental authorities geographic expansions into higher taxing jurisdictions and the effect of expansions into international markets 23 Table of Contents Our contracts with states may require us to maintain a minimum HBR or may require us to share profits in excess of certain levels In certain circumstances our plans may be required to return premium back to the state in the event profits exceed established levels or HBR does not meet the minimum requirement Other states may require us to meet certain performance and quality metrics in order to maintain our contract or receive additional or full contractual revenue The governmental healthcare programs in which we participate are subject to the satisfaction of certain regulations and performance standards For example under the ACA Congress authorized CMS and the states to implement managed care demonstration programs to serve dually eligible beneficiaries to improve the coordination of their care Participation in these demonstration programs is subject to CMS approval and the satisfaction of conditions to participation including meeting certain performance requirements Our inability to improve or maintain adequate quality scores and Star ratings to meet government performance requirements or to match the performance of our competitors could result in limitations to our participation in or exclusion from these or other government programs Specifically several of our Medicaid contracts require us to maintain a Medicare health plan Although we strive to comply with all existing regulations and to meet performance standards applicable to our business failure to meet these requirements could result in financial fines and penalties Also states or other governmental entities may not allow us to continue to participate in their government programs or we may fail to win procurements to participate in such programs which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows In addition as a result of the expansion of our businesses and operations conducted in foreign countries we face political economic legal compliance regulatory operational and other risks and exposures that are unique and vary by jurisdiction These foreign regulatory requirements with respect to among other items environmental tax licensing intellectual property privacy data protection investment capital management control labor relations and fraud and corruption regulations are different than those faced by our domestic businesses In addition we are subject to US laws that regulate the conduct and activities of USbased businesses operating abroad such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Our failure to comply with laws and regulations governing our conduct outside the United States or to successfully navigate international regulatory regimes that apply to us could adversely affect our ability to market our products and services which may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations Our businesses providing pharmacy benefit management PBM and specialty pharmacy services face regulatory and other risks and uncertainties which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows We provide PBM and specialty pharmacy services including through our Envolve Pharmacy Solutions product These businesses are subject to federal and state laws that govern the relationships of the business with pharmaceutical manufacturers physicians pharmacies customers and consumers We also conduct business as a mail order pharmacy and specialty pharmacy which subjects these businesses to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations In addition federal and state legislatures regularly consider new regulations for the industry that could materially and adversely affect current industry practices including the receipt or disclosure of rebates from pharmaceutical companies the development and use of formularies and the use of average wholesale prices Our PBM and specialty pharmacy businesses would be materially and adversely affected by an inability to contract on favorable terms with pharmaceutical manufacturers and other suppliers including with respect to the pricing of new specialty and generic drugs In addition our PBM and specialty pharmacy businesses could face potential claims in connection with purported errors by our mail order or specialty pharmacies including in connection with the risks inherent in the authorization compounding packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other healthcare products Disruptions at any of our mail order or specialty pharmacies due to an event that is beyond our control could affect our ability to process and dispense prescriptions in a timely manner and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 24 Table of Contents If any of our government contracts are terminated or are not renewed on favorable terms or at all or if we receive an adverse finding or review resulting from an audit or investigation our business may be adversely affected A substantial portion of our business relates to the provision of managed care programs and selected services to individuals receiving benefits under governmental assistance or entitlement programs We provide these and other healthcare services under contracts with government entities in the areas in which we operate Our government contracts are generally intended to run for a fixed number of years and may be extended for an additional specified number of years if the contracting entity or its agent elects to do so When our contracts with the government expire they may be opened for bidding by competing healthcare providers and there is no guarantee that our contracts will be renewed or extended Competitors may buy their way into the market by submitting bids with lower pricing Even if our responsive bids are successful the bids may be based upon assumptions or other factors which could result in the contracts being less profitable than we had anticipated Further our government contracts contain certain provisions regarding eligibility enrollment and disenrollment processes for covered services eligible providers periodic financial and informational reporting quality assurance timeliness of claims payment and agreement to maintain a Medicare plan in the state and financial standards among other things and are subject to cancellation if we fail to perform in accordance with the standards set by regulatory agencies We are also subject to various reviews audits and investigations to verify our compliance with the terms of our contracts with various governmental agencies as well as compliance with applicable laws and regulations Any adverse review audit or investigation could result in among other things cancellation of our contracts refunding of amounts we have been paid pursuant to our contracts imposition of fines penalties and other sanctions on us loss of our right to participate in various programs increased difficulty in selling our products and services loss of one or more of our licenses lowered quality Star ratings or require changes to the way we do business In addition under government procurement regulations and practices a negative determination resulting from a government audit of our business practices could result in a contractor being fined debarred andor suspended from being able to bid on or be awarded new government contracts for a period of time If any of our government contracts are terminated not renewed renewed on less favorable terms or not renewed on a timely basis or if we receive an adverse finding or review resulting from an audit or investigation our business and reputation may be adversely impacted our goodwill could be impaired and our financial position results of operations or cash flows may be materially affected We contract with independent third party vendors and service providers who provide services to us and our subsidiaries or to whom we delegate selected functions Violations of or noncompliance with laws and regulations governing our business by such third parties or governing our dealings with such parties could among other things subject us to additional audits reviews and investigations and other adverse effects Ineffectiveness of stateoperated systems and subcontractors could adversely affect our business A number of our health plans rely on other stateoperated systems or subcontractors to qualify solicit educate and assign eligible members into managed care plans The effectiveness of these state operations and subcontractors can have a material effect on a health plans enrollment in a particular month or over an extended period When a state implements new programs to determine eligibility new processes to assign or enroll eligible members into health plans or chooses new subcontractors there is an increased potential for an unanticipated impact on the overall number of members assigned to managed care plans Our investment portfolio may suffer losses which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or liquidity We maintain a significant investment portfolio of cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm investments in a variety of securities which are subject to general credit liquidity market and interest rate risks and will decline in value if interest rates increase or one of the issuers credit ratings is reduced As a result we may experience a reduction in value or loss of our investments which may have a negative adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity and financial condition Execution of our growth strategy may increase costs or liabilities or create disruptions in our business Our growth strategy includes without limitation the acquisition and expansion of health plans participating in government sponsored healthcare programs and specialty services businesses contract rights and related assets of other health plans both in our existing service areas and in new markets and startup operations in new markets or new products in existing markets Although we review the records of companies or businesses we plan to acquire it is possible that we could assume unanticipated liabilities or adverse operating conditions or an acquisition may not perform as well as expected or may not achieve timely profitability We also face the risk that we will not be able to effectively integrate acquisitions into our existing operations effectively without substantial expense delay or other operational or financial problems and we may need to divert more management resources to integration than we planned 25 Table of Contents In connection with startup operations and system migrations we may incur significant expenses prior to commencement of operations and the receipt of revenue For example in order to obtain a certificate of authority in most jurisdictions we must first establish a provider network have systems in place and demonstrate our ability to administer a state contract and process claims We may experience delays in operational start dates As a result of these factors startup operations may decrease our profitability In addition we are planning to expand our business internationally and we will be subject to additional risks including but not limited to political risk an unfamiliar regulatory regime currency exchange risk and exchange controls cultural and language differences foreign tax issues and different labor laws and practices If we are unable to effectively execute our growth strategy our future growth will suffer and our results of operations could be harmed If competing managed care programs are unwilling to purchase specialty services from us we may not be able to successfully implement our strategy of diversifying our business lines We are seeking to diversify our business lines into areas that complement our government sponsored health plan business in order to grow our revenue stream and balance our dependence on risk reimbursement In order to diversify our business we must succeed in selling the services of our specialty subsidiaries not only to our managed care plans but to programs operated by thirdparties Some of these thirdparty programs may compete with us in some markets and they therefore may be unwilling to purchase specialty services from us In any event the offering of these services will require marketing activities that differ significantly from the manner in which we seek to increase revenues from our government sponsored programs Our ineffectiveness in marketing specialty services to thirdparties may impair our ability to execute our business strategy Adverse credit market conditions may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity or our ability to obtain credit on acceptable terms In the past the securities and credit markets have experienced extreme volatility and disruption The availability of credit from virtually all types of lenders has at times been restricted In the event we need access to additional capital to pay our operating expenses fund subsidiary surplus requirements make payments on or refinance our indebtedness pay capital expenditures or fund acquisitions our ability to obtain such capital may be limited and the cost of any such capital may be significant particularly if we are unable to access our existing credit facility Our access to additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as prevailing economic and credit market conditions the general availability of credit the overall availability of credit to our industry our credit ratings and credit capacity and perceptions of our financial prospects Similarly our access to funds may be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us If a combination of these factors were to occur our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient and in such case we may not be able to successfully obtain sufficient additional financing on favorable terms within an acceptable time or at all If state regulators do not approve payments of dividends and distributions by our subsidiaries to us we may not have sufficient funds to implement our business strategy We principally operate through our health plan subsidiaries As part of normal operations we may make requests for dividends and distributions from our subsidiaries to fund our operations These subsidiaries are subject to regulations that limit the amount of dividends and distributions that can be paid to us without prior approval of or notification to state regulators If these regulators were to deny our subsidiaries request to pay dividends the funds available to us would be limited which could harm our ability to implement our business strategy We derive a majority of our premium revenues from operations in a limited number of states and our financial position results of operations or cash flows would be materially affected by a decrease in premium revenues or profitability in any one of those states Operations in a limited number of states have accounted for most of our premium revenues to date If we were unable to continue to operate in any of those states or if our current operations in any portion of one of those states were significantly curtailed our revenues could decrease materially Our reliance on operations in a limited number of states could cause our revenues and profitability to change suddenly and unexpectedly depending on legislative or other governmental or regulatory actions and decisions economic conditions and similar factors in those states For example states we currently serve may open the bidding for their Medicaid program to other health insurers through a request for proposal process Our inability to continue to operate in any of the states in which we operate could harm our business 26 Table of Contents Competition may limit our ability to increase penetration of the markets that we serve We compete for members principally on the basis of size and quality of provider networks benefits provided and quality of service We compete with numerous types of competitors including other health plans and traditional state Medicaid programs that reimburse providers as care is provided as well as technology companies new joint ventures financial services firms consulting firms and other nontraditional competitors In addition the administration of the ACA has the potential to shift the competitive landscape in our segment Some of the health plans with which we compete have greater financial and other resources and offer a broader scope of products than we do In addition significant merger and acquisition activity has occurred in the managed care industry as well as complementary industries such as the hospital physician pharmaceutical medical device and health information systems businesses To the extent that competition intensifies in any market that we serve as a result of industry consolidation or otherwise our ability to retain or increase members and providers or maintain or increase our revenue growth pricing flexibility and control over medical cost trends may be adversely affected If we are unable to maintain relationships with our provider networks our profitability may be harmed Our profitability depends in large part upon our ability to contract at competitive prices with hospitals physicians and other healthcare providers Our provider arrangements with our primary care physicians specialists and hospitals generally may be canceled by either party without cause upon 90 to 120 days prior written notice We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to continue to renew our existing contracts or enter into new contracts on a timely basis or under favorable terms enabling us to service our members profitably Healthcare providers with whom we contract may not properly manage the costs of services maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our operations In any particular market physicians and other healthcare providers could refuse to contract demand higher payments or take other actions that could result in higher medical costs or difficulty in meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements among other things In some markets certain healthcare providers particularly hospitals physicianhospital organizations or multispecialty physician groups may have significant market positions or near monopolies that could result in diminished bargaining power on our part In addition accountable care organizations practice management companies which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency and marketing leverage and other organizational structures that physicians hospitals and other healthcare providers choose may change the way in which these providers interact with us and may change the competitive landscape Such organizations or groups of healthcare providers may compete directly with us which could adversely affect our operations and our results of operations financial position and cash flows by impacting our relationships with these providers or affecting the way that we price our products and estimate our costs which might require us to incur costs to change our operations Provider networks may consolidate resulting in a reduction in the competitive environment In addition if these providers refuse to contract with us use their market position to negotiate contracts unfavorable to us or place us at a competitive disadvantage our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be materially and adversely affected From time to time healthcare providers assert or threaten to assert claims seeking to terminate noncancelable agreements due to alleged actions or inactions by us If we are unable to retain our current provider contract terms or enter into new provider contracts timely or on favorable terms our profitability may be harmed In addition from time to time we may be subject to class action or other lawsuits by healthcare providers with respect to claim payment procedures or similar matters For example our wholly owned subsidiary Health Net Life Insurance Company HNL is and may continue to be subject to such disputes with respect to HNLs payment levels in connection with the processing of outofnetwork provider reimbursement claims for the provision of certain substance abuse related services HNL expects to vigorously defend its claims payment practices Nevertheless in the event HNL receives an adverse finding in any related legal proceeding or from a regulator or is otherwise required to reimburse providers for these claims at rates that are higher than expected or for claims HNL otherwise believes are unallowable our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected In addition regardless of whether any such lawsuits brought against us are successful or have merit they will still be timeconsuming and costly and could distract our managements attention As a result under such circumstances we may incur significant expenses and may be unable to operate our business effectively 27 Table of Contents We may be unable to attract retain or effectively manage the succession of key personnel We are highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to operate and expand our business We would be adversely impacted if we are unable to adequately plan for the succession of our executives and senior management While we have succession plans in place for members of our executive and senior management team these plans do not guarantee that the services of our executive and senior management team will continue to be available to us Our ability to replace any departed members of our executive and senior management or other key employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in the managed care and specialty services industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to operate and successfully expand a business such as ours Competition to hire from this limited pool is intense and we may be unable to hire train retain or motivate these personnel If we are unable to attract retain and effectively manage the succession plans for key personnel executives and senior management our business and financial position results of operations or cash flows could be harmed If we are unable to integrate and manage our information systems effectively our operations could be disrupted Our operations depend significantly on effective information systems The information gathered and processed by our information systems assists us in among other things monitoring utilization and other cost factors processing provider claims and providing data to our regulators Our healthcare providers also depend upon our information systems for membership verifications claims status and other information Our information systems and applications require continual maintenance upgrading and enhancement to meet our operational needs and regulatory requirements We regularly upgrade and expand our information systems capabilities If we experience difficulties with the transition to or from information systems or do not appropriately integrate maintain enhance or expand our information systems we could suffer among other things operational disruptions loss of existing members and difficulty in attracting new members regulatory problems and increases in administrative expenses In addition our ability to integrate and manage our information systems may be impaired as the result of events outside our control including acts of nature such as earthquakes or fires or acts of terrorists From time to time we may become involved in costly and timeconsuming litigation and other regulatory proceedings which require significant attention from our management From time to time we are a defendant in lawsuits and regulatory actions and are subject to investigations relating to our business including without limitation medical malpractice claims claims by members alleging failure to pay for or provide healthcare claims related to nonpayment or insufficient payments for outofnetwork services claims alleging bad faith investigations regarding our submission of risk adjuster claims putative securities class actions and claims related to the imposition of new taxes including but not limited to claims that may have retroactive application Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings An unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial position results of operations andor cash flows and may affect our reputation In addition regardless of the outcome of any litigation or regulatory proceedings such proceedings are costly and time consuming and require significant attention from our management and could therefore harm our business and financial position results of operations or cash flows An impairment charge with respect to our recorded goodwill and intangible assets could have a material impact on our results of operations We periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may be impaired in which case a charge to earnings may be necessary Changes in business strategy government regulations or economic or market conditions have resulted and may result in impairments of our goodwill and other intangible assets at any time in the future Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on among other things legal factors market conditions and operational performance For example the nonrenewal of our health plan contracts with the state in which they operate may be an indicator of impairment If an event or events occur that would cause us to revise our estimates and assumptions used in analyzing the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets such revision could result in a noncash impairment charge that could have a material impact on our results of operations in the period in which the impairment occurs 28 Table of Contents If we fail to comply with applicable privacy security and data laws regulations and standards including with respect to thirdparty service providers that utilize sensitive personal information on our behalf our business reputation results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected As part of our normal operations we collect process and retain confidential member information We are subject to various federal and state laws and rules regarding the use and disclosure of confidential member information including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 HIPAA and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health HITECH Act of 2009 and the GrammLeachBliley Act which require us to protect the privacy of medical records and safeguard personal health information we maintain and use Certain of our businesses are also subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard which is a multifaceted security standard that is designed to protect credit card account data as mandated by payment card industry entities Despite our best attempts to maintain adherence to information privacy and security best practices as well as compliance with applicable laws rules and contractual requirements our facilities and systems and those of our third party service providers may be vulnerable to privacy or security breaches acts of vandalism or theft malware or other forms of cyberattack misplaced or lost data including paper or electronic media programming andor human errors or other similar events In the past we have had data breaches resulting in disclosure of confidential or protected health information that have not resulted in any material financial loss or penalty to date However future data breaches could require us to expend significant resources to remediate any damage interrupt our operations and damage our reputation subject us to state or federal agency review and could also result in enforcement actions material fines and penalties litigation or other actions which could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation and results of operations financial position and cash flows In addition HIPAA broadened the scope of fraud and abuse laws applicable to healthcare companies HIPAA established new enforcement mechanisms to combat fraud and abuse including civil and in some instances criminal penalties for failure to comply with specific standards relating to the privacy security and electronic transmission of protected health information The HITECH Act expanded the scope of these provisions by mandating individual notification in instances of breaches of protected health information providing enhanced penalties for HIPAA violations and granting enforcement authority to states Attorneys General in addition to the HHS Office for Civil Rights It is possible that Congress may enact additional legislation in the future to increase penalties and to create a private right of action under HIPAA which could entitle patients to seek monetary damages for violations of the privacy rules Additionally HHS continued its auditing program in 2016 to assess compliance efforts by covered entities and business associates Through a second phase of audits which commenced for covered entities in July 2016 HHS focused on a review of policies and procedures adopted and employed by covered entities and their business associates to meet selected standards and implementation specifications of the HIPAA Privacy Security and Breach Notification Rules An audit resulting in findings or allegations of noncompliance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows If we fail to comply with the extensive federal and state fraud and abuse laws our business reputation results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected We along with all other companies involved in public healthcare programs are the subject of fraud and abuse investigations from time to time The regulations and contractual requirements applicable to participants in these public sector programs are complex and subject to change Violations of fraud and abuse laws applicable to us could result in civil monetary penalties criminal fines and imprisonment andor exclusion from participation in Medicaid Medicare TRICARE VA and other federal healthcare programs and federally funded state health programs Fraud and abuse prohibitions encompass a wide range of activities including kickbacks for referral of members incorrect and unsubstantiated billing or billing for unnecessary medical services improper marketing and violations of patient privacy rights These fraud and abuse laws include the federal False Claims Act which prohibits the known filing of a false claim or the known use of false statements to obtain payment from the federal government and the federal antikickback statute which prohibits the payment or receipt of remuneration to induce referrals or recommendations of healthcare items or services Many states have false claim act and antikickback statutes that closely resemble the federal False Claims Act and the federal antikickback statute In addition the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 encouraged states to enact stateversions of the federal False Claims Act that establish liability to the state for false and fraudulent Medicaid claims and that provide for among other things claims to be filed by qui tam relators Federal and state governments have made investigating and prosecuting healthcare fraud and abuse a priority In the event we fail to comply with the extensive federal and state fraud and abuse laws our business reputation results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 29 Table of Contents A failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure or those of third parties with which we do business including as a result of cyberattacks could have an adverse effect on our business Information security risks have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct our operations and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime hackers terrorists and other external parties including foreign state agents Our operations rely on the secure processing transmission and storage of confidential proprietary and other information in our computer systems and networks Security breaches may arise from external or internal threats External breaches include hacking personal information for financial gain attempting to cause harm or interruption to our operations or intending to obtain competitive information We experience attempted external hacking or malicious attacks on a regular basis We maintain a rigorous system of preventive and detective controls through our security programs however our prevention and detection controls may not prevent or identify all such attacks on a timely basis or at all Internal breaches may result from inappropriate security access to confidential information by rogue employees consultants or third party service providers Any security breach involving the misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential member information financial data competitively sensitive information or other proprietary data whether by us or a third party could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation financial condition cash flows or results of operations The market price of our common stock may decline as a result of significant acquisitions The market price of our common stock is generally subject to volatility and there can be no assurances regarding the level or stability of our share price at any time The market price of our common stock may decline as a result of acquisitions if among other things we are unable to achieve the expected growth in earnings or if the operational cost savings estimates in connection with the integration of acquired businesses with ours are not realized or if the transaction costs related to the acquisitions and integrations are greater than expected The market price also may decline if we do not achieve the perceived benefits of the acquisitions as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts or if the effect of the acquisitions on our financial position results of operations or cash flows is not consistent with the expectations of financial or industry analysts We may be unable to successfully integrate our business with Health Net and realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition We completed the acquisition of Health Net on March 24 2016 The success of the acquisition of Health Net will depend in part on our ability to successfully combine the businesses of the Company and Health Net and realize the anticipated benefits including synergies cost savings growth in earnings innovation and operational efficiencies from the combination If we are unable to achieve these objectives within the anticipated time frame or at all the anticipated benefits may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected and the value of our common stock may be harmed The integration of Health Nets business with our existing business is a complex costly and timeconsuming process We have not previously completed a transaction comparable in size or scope to the acquisition of Health Net The integration of the two companies may result in material challenges including without limitation  the diversion of managements attention from ongoing business concerns and performance shortfalls as a result of the devotion of managements attention to the integration  managing a larger combined company  maintaining employee morale and retaining key management and other employees  the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding the integration process  retaining existing business and operational relationships and attracting new business and operational relationships  consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating duplicative operations  coordinating geographically separate organizations  unanticipated issues in integrating information technology communications and other systems  unanticipated changes in federal or state laws or regulations including changes with respect to government healthcare programs the ACA and any regulations enacted thereunder and  unforeseen expenses or delays associated with the acquisition andor integration Many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in delays increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of managements time and energy which could materially affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows 30 Table of Contents We have incurred substantial expenses related to the completion of the acquisition of Health Net and are incurring substantial expenses related to the integration of Health Net We are in the process of integrating a large number of processes policies procedures operations technologies and systems including sales pricing and marketing among other things In addition the businesses of Centene and Health Net will continue to maintain a presence in St Louis Missouri and Woodland Hills California respectively The substantial majority of these costs will be nonrecurring expenses related to the acquisition including financing of the acquisition facilities and systems consolidation costs We may incur additional costs to maintain employee morale and to retain key employees We are also incurring transaction fees and costs related to formulating integration plans for the combined business and the execution of these plans may lead to additional unanticipated costs These incremental transaction and acquisition related costs may exceed the savings we expect to achieve from the elimination of duplicative costs and the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses particularly in the near term and in the event there are material unanticipated costs Our future results may be adversely impacted if we do not effectively manage our expanded operations following the completion of our acquisition of Health Net The size of our business following the acquisition of Health Net is significantly larger than the size of either our or Health Nets respective businesses prior to the acquisition Our ability to successfully manage the expanded business will depend in part upon managements ability to design and implement strategic initiatives that address the increased scale and scope of the combined business with its associated increased costs and complexity We will also have to manage our expanded operations in compliance with certain undertakings with regulators that were agreed to in connection with the approval of the acquisition These undertakings require significant investments by us may restrict or impose additional material costs on our future operations and strategic initiatives in certain geographies and subject us to various enforcement mechanisms There can be no assurances that we will be successful in managing our expanded operations or that we will realize the expected growth in earnings operating efficiencies cost savings and other benefits We have substantial indebtedness outstanding and may incur additional indebtedness in the future Such indebtedness could reduce our agility and may adversely affect our financial condition As of December 31 2017  we had consolidated indebtedness of approximately 4699 million  We may further increase our indebtedness in the future This increased indebtedness and higher debttoequity ratio will have the effect among other things of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and increasing borrowing costs Among other things our revolving credit facility requires us to comply with various covenants that impose restrictions on our operations including our ability to incur additional indebtedness create liens pay dividends make investments or other restricted payments sell or otherwise dispose of substantially all of our assets and engage in other activities Our revolving credit facility also requires us to comply with a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio These restrictive covenants could limit our ability to pursue our business strategies In addition any failure by us to comply with these restrictive covenants could result in an event of default under the revolving credit facility and in some circumstances under the indentures governing our notes which in any case could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition The Proposed Fidelis Acquisition may not occur and if it does it may not be accretive and may cause dilution to our earnings per share which may negatively affect the market price of our common stock Although we currently anticipate that the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition will occur and will be accretive to earnings per share on an adjusted earnings basis that is not pursuant to GAAP from and after the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition this expectation is based on assumptions about our and Fidelis Cares business and preliminary estimates which may change materially As a result should the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition occur certain other amounts to be paid in connection with the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition may cause dilution to our earnings per share or decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition and cause a decrease in the market price of our common stock The Proposed Fidelis Acquisition may not occur as a result In addition we could also encounter additional transactionrelated costs or other factors such as the failure to realize all of the benefits anticipated in the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition including cost and revenue synergies All of these factors could cause dilution to our earnings per share or decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition and cause a decrease in the market price of our common stock 31 Table of Contents The Proposed Fidelis Acquisition is subject to conditions some or all of which may not be satisfied or completed on a timely basis if at all Failure to complete the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition could have material adverse effects on our business The completion of the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition is subject to a number of conditions including among others the receipt of certain regulatory approvals which make the completion and timing of the completion of the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition uncertain Also either we or Fidelis Care may terminate the asset purchase agreement if the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition has not been consummated by July 1 2018 or September 1 2018 if the extension is exercised except that this right to terminate the asset purchase agreement will not be available to any party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under the asset purchase agreement has been the cause of or resulted in the failure of the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition to be consummated on or before that date If the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition is not completed our ongoing business may be materially adversely affected and without realizing any of the benefits that we could have realized had the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition been completed we will be subject to a number of risks including the following  the market price of our common stock could decline  if the asset purchase agreement is terminated and our board of directors Board seeks another business combination our stockholders cannot be certain that we will be able to find a party willing to enter into any transaction on terms equivalent to or more attractive than the terms that we and Fidelis Care have agreed to in the asset purchase agreement  time and resources committed by our management to matters relating to the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition could otherwise have been devoted to pursuing other beneficial opportunities  we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets or from our customers or employees and  we will be required to pay our costs relating to the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition such as legal accounting financial advisory and printing fees whether or not the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition is completed In addition if the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition is not completed we could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition or related to any enforcement proceeding commenced against us to perform our obligations under the asset purchase agreement If any such risk materializes it could adversely impact our ongoing business Similarly delays in the completion of the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition could among other things result in additional transaction costs loss of revenue or other negative effects associated with uncertainty about completion of the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition and cause us not to realize some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve if the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition is successfully completed within its expected timeframe We cannot assure you that the conditions to the closing of the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition will be satisfied or waived or that the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition will be consummated Centene and Fidelis Care are each subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the proposed acquisition is pending which could adversely affect the business and operations of us or the combined company In connection with the pendency of the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition it is possible that some customers suppliers and other persons with whom we or Fidelis Care has a business relationship may delay or defer certain business decisions or might decide to seek to terminate change or renegotiate their relationships with us or Fidelis Care as the case may be as a result of the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition which could negatively affect our current or the combined companys future revenues earnings and cash flows as well as the market price of our common stock regardless of whether the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition is completed Under the terms of the asset purchase agreement Fidelis Care is subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of its business prior to completing the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition which may adversely affect its ability to execute certain of its business strategies including the ability in certain cases to enter into or amend contracts acquire or dispose of assets incur indebtedness or incur capital expenditures Such limitations could adversely affect Fidelis Cares business and operations prior to the completion of the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition Each of the risks described above may be exacerbated by delays or other adverse developments with respect to the completion of the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition 32 Table of Contents The Proposed Fidelis Acquisition is subject to the receipt of approvals consents or clearances from regulatory authorities that may impose conditions that could have an adverse effect on us or the combined company or if not obtained could prevent completion of the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition Before the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition may be completed any approvals consents or clearances required in connection with the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition must have been obtained in each case under applicable law including pursuant to the insurance laws notforprofit laws and in some instances state healthcare laws In deciding whether to grant the required regulatory approval consent or clearance the relevant governmental entities will consider the effect of the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition on competition within their relevant jurisdiction The terms and conditions of the approvals consents and clearances that are granted may impose requirements limitations or costs or place restrictions on the conduct of the combined companys business Under the asset purchase agreement we have agreed with Fidelis Care to use our reasonable best efforts to obtain such approvals consents and clearances and therefore may be required to comply with conditions or limitations imposed by governmental authorities except that i we may not be required to agree to any term limitation restriction or requirement that individually or in the aggregate a would have or could reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse effect on the financial condition results of operations or business of us or Fidelis Care in each case as currently conducted b would or could reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse effect on any lines or types of business in the aggregate in which we or Fidelis Care shall be permitted to engage or c would have or could reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse effect on the overall benefits that we reasonably expect to derive from the consummation of the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition and ii Fidelis Care may not be required to agree to any term limitation restriction or requirement that individually or in the aggregate would have or could reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse effect on the overall benefits that Fidelis Care reasonably expects to derive from the consummation of the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition In addition regulators may impose conditions terms obligations or restrictions in connection with their approval of or consent to the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition and such conditions terms obligations or restrictions may delay completion of the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition or impose additional material costs on or materially limit the revenues of the combined company following the completion of the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition Regulators may impose such conditions terms obligations or restrictions and if imposed such conditions terms obligations or restrictions may delay or lead to the abandonment of the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition Uncertainties associated with the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition may cause a loss of management personnel and other key employees which could adversely affect the future business and operations of the combined company We and Fidelis Care are each dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of their officers and other key employees to execute their business plans The combined companys success after the completion of the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition will depend in part upon the ability of each of us and Fidelis Care to retain key management personnel and other key employees Prior to completion of the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition current and prospective employees of each of us and Fidelis Care may experience uncertainty about their roles within the combined company following the completion of the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition which may have an adverse effect on the ability of each of us and Fidelis Care to attract or retain key management and other key personnel In addition no assurance can be given that the combined company will be able to attract or retain key management personnel and other key employees of each of us and Fidelis Care to the same extent that we and Fidelis Care have previously been able to attract or retain their own employees Completion of the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition may trigger change in control or other provisions in certain agreements to which Fidelis Care is a party which may have an adverse impact on the combined companys business and results of operations The completion of the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition may trigger change in control and other provisions in certain agreements to which Fidelis Care is a party If we are unable to negotiate waivers of those provisions with Fidelis Care the counterparties may exercise their rights and remedies under the agreements potentially terminating the agreements or seeking monetary damages Even if we are able to negotiate waivers with Fidelis Care the counterparties may require a fee for such waivers or seek to renegotiate the agreements on terms less favorable to Fidelis Care or the combined company Any of the foregoing or similar developments may have an adverse impact on the combined companys business and results of operations 33 Table of Contents The combined company may be unable to successfully integrate our business with the assets acquired in the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition and realize the anticipated benefits of the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition The success of the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition will depend in part on the combined companys ability to successfully combine our business and the assets acquired in the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition and realize the anticipated benefits including synergies cost savings innovation and operational efficiencies from the combination If the combined company is unable to achieve these objectives within the anticipated time frame or at all the anticipated benefits may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected and the value of its common stock may be harmed Additionally rating agencies may take negative actions against the combined company The Proposed Fidelis Acquisition involves the integration of certain assets of Fidelis Care with our existing business which is expected to be a complex costly and timeconsuming process The integration may result in material challenges including without limitation  the diversion of managements attention from ongoing business concerns and performance shortfalls at one or both of the companies as a result of the devotion of managements attention to the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition  managing a larger combined company  maintaining employee morale and retaining key management and other employees  the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding the integration process  retaining existing business and operational relationships and attracting new business and operational relationships  consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating duplicative operations  coordinating geographically separate organizations  unanticipated issues in integrating information technology communications and other systems  unanticipated changes in federal or state laws or regulations including the ACA and any regulations enacted thereunder  decreases in premiums paid under government sponsored healthcare programs by any state in which the combined company operates and  unforeseen expenses or delays associated with the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition Many of these factors will be outside of the combined companys control and any one of them could result in delays increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of managements time and energy which could materially affect the combined companys financial position results of operations and cash flows The integration of Fidelis Care with our business may result in unforeseen expenses and the anticipated benefits of the integration plan may not be realized These integration matters could have an adverse effect on i each of us and Fidelis Care during this transition period and ii the combined company for an undetermined period after completion of the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition In addition any actual cost savings of the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition could be less than anticipated The future results of the combined company may be adversely impacted if the combined company does not effectively manage its expanded operations following the completion of the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition Following the completion of the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition the size of the combined companys business will be significantly larger than the current size of our business The combined companys ability to successfully manage this expanded business will depend in part upon managements ability to design and implement strategic initiatives that address not only the integration of two discrete companies but also the increased scale and scope of the combined business with its associated increased costs and complexity The combined company may not be successful or may not realize the expected operating efficiencies cost savings and other benefits currently anticipated from the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition 34 Table of Contents The combined company is expected to incur substantial expenses related to the completion of the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition and the integration of our business with Fidelis Care The combined company is expected to incur substantial expenses in connection with the completion of the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition and the integration of our business with substantially all of the assets of Fidelis Care There are a large number of processes policies procedures operations technologies and systems that must be integrated including purchasing accounting and finance sales payroll pricing revenue management marketing and benefits In addition our businesses and Fidelis Care will continue to maintain a presence in St Louis Missouri and New York New York respectively The substantial majority of these costs will be nonrecurring expenses related to the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition including financing of the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition facilities and systems consolidation costs The combined company may incur additional costs to maintain employee morale and to retain key employees We will also incur transaction fees and costs related to formulating integration plans for the combined business and the execution of these plans may lead to additional unanticipated costs Additionally as a result of the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition rating agencies may take negative actions with regard to the combined companys credit ratings which may increase the combined companys costs in connection with the financing of the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition These incremental transaction and acquisition related costs may exceed the savings the combined company expects to achieve from the elimination of duplicative costs and the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses particularly in the near term and in the event there are material unanticipated costs We will incur additional indebtedness to finance the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition In connection with the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition we expect to incur approximately 16 billion in additional indebtedness assuming we do not use the option to fund up to 500 million of the acquisition consideration in our common stock and assuming we issue approximately 23 billion of new equity The combined company will have consolidated indebtedness of approximately 63 billion which is greater than our current indebtedness prior to the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition The increased indebtedness of the combined company in comparison to ours on a historical basis could adversely affect us in a number of ways including  affecting our ability to pay or refinance its debts as they become due during adverse economic financial market and industry conditions  requiring us to use a larger portion of its cash flow for debt service reducing funds available for other purposes  causing us to be less able to take advantage of business opportunities such as acquisition opportunities and to react to changes in market or industry conditions  increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic industry or competitive developments  affecting our ability to obtain additional financing  decreasing our profitability andor cash flow  causing us to be disadvantaged compared to competitors with less leverage  resulting in a downgrade in our credit rating or any of our indebtedness or our subsidiaries which could increase the cost of further borrowings and  limiting our ability to borrow additional funds in the future to fund working capital capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes The financing arrangements that the combined company will enter into in connection with the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition may under certain circumstances contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly impact the combined companys ability to operate its business We intend to incur additional indebtedness in connection with the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition We expect that the agreements governing the indebtedness incurred in connection with the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition will contain covenants that among other things may under certain circumstances place limitations on the dollar amounts paid or other actions relating to  payments in respect of or redemptions or acquisitions of debt or equity issued by the combined company or its subsidiaries including the payment of dividends on our common stock  incurring additional indebtedness  incurring guarantee obligations  paying dividends 35 Table of Contents  creating liens on assets  entering into sale and leaseback transactions  making investments loans or advances  entering into hedging transactions  engaging in mergers consolidations or sales of all or substantially all of their respective assets and  engaging in certain transactions with affiliates In addition the combined company will be required to maintain a minimum amount of excess availability as set forth in these agreements The combined companys ability to maintain minimum excess availability in future periods will depend on its ongoing financial and operating performance which in turn will be subject to economic conditions and to financial market and competitive factors many of which are beyond the combined companys control The ability to comply with this covenant in future periods will also depend on the combined companys ability to successfully implement its overall business strategy and realize contemplated synergies Various risks uncertainties and events beyond the combined companys control could affect its ability to comply with the covenants contained in its debt agreements Failure to comply with any of the covenants in its existing or future financing agreements could result in a default under those agreements and under other agreements containing crossdefault provisions A default would permit lenders to accelerate the maturity of indebtedness under these agreements and to foreclose upon any collateral securing such indebtedness Under these circumstances the combined company might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of its obligations In addition the limitations imposed by financing agreements on the combined companys ability to incur additional indebtedness and to take other actions might significantly impair its ability to obtain other financing We have obtained commitment letters for the senior unsecured budge loan facility However neither the definitive loan documents nor the terms of any debt financing in lieu of such bridge financing have been finalized Future issuances and sales of additional shares of preferred or common stock including shares issued in connection with the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition could reduce the market price of our shares of common stock Subject to market conditions we intend to fund the purchase price for the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition with 23 billion of new equity including shares paid as consideration Any such issuances and sales of our preferred or common stock could have the effect of depressing the market price for our common stock Further any sale of shares to finance a portion of the purchase price for the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition will be subject to market conditions and could be negatively impacted by a decline in the market price for our common stock In addition in the future we may issue additional securities to raise capital or in connection with acquisitions We often acquire interests in other companies by using a combination of cash and our common stock or just our common stock Further shares of preferred stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series as our Board may from time to time determine each such series to be distinctively designated The issuance of any such preferred stock could materially adversely affect the rights of holders of our common stock Any of these events may dilute your ownership interest in our company and have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock Item 1B Unresolved Staff Comments None Item 2 Properties We own our corporate office headquarters buildings and land located in St Louis Missouri which is used by each of our reportable segments We generally lease space in the states where our health plans specialty companies and claims processing facilities operate We are required by various insurance and regulatory authorities to have offices in the service areas where we provide benefits We believe our current facilities and expansion plans are adequate to meet our operational needs for the foreseeable future Item 3 Legal Proceedings A description of the
