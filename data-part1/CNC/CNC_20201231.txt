continued focus on affordable highquality culturallysensitive healthcare services With the WellCare Acquisition we further broadened our product offerings by adding a Medicare prescription drug plan to our existing business lines INDUSTRY We provide a full spectrum of managed healthcare products and services primarily through Medicaid Medicare and commercial products We currently have operations domestically and internationally Medicaid Established in 1965 Medicaid is the largest publicly funded program in the United States and provides health insurance to lowincome families and individuals with disabilities Authorized by Title XIX of the Social Security Act Medicaid is an entitlement program funded jointly by the federal and state governments and administered by the states The majority of funding is provided by the federal government Each state establishes its own eligibility standards benefit packages payment 1 Table of Contents rates and program administration within federal standards As a result there are 56 Medicaid programs  one for each US state each US territory and the District of Columbia Eligibility is based on a combination of household income and assets often determined by an income level relative to the federal poverty level Historically children have represented the largest eligibility group Many states have selected Medicaid managed care as a means of delivering quality healthcare and controlling costs We refer to these states as mandatory managed care states Under the Affordable Care Act ACA Medicaid coverage was expanded to all individuals under age 65 with incomes up to 138 of the federal poverty level subject to the states elections The federal government paid the entire costs for Medicaid Expansion coverage for newly eligible beneficiaries from 2014 through 2016 95 of the costs in 2017 94 of the costs in 2018 93 of the costs in 2019 and 90 of the costs in 2020 Assuming that the current program remains in effect unchanged in subsequent years the federal share is scheduled to remain at 90 Established in 1972 and authorized by Title XVI of the Social Security Act the Aged Blind or Disabled ABD program covers lowincome persons with chronic physical disabilities or behavioral health impairments ABD beneficiaries represent a growing portion of all Medicaid recipients In addition ABD recipients typically utilize more services as a result of their more complicated health status The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 created the State Childrens Health Insurance Program CHIP to help states expand coverage primarily to children whose families earned too much to qualify for Medicaid yet not enough to afford private health insurance Costs related to the largest eligibility group children are primarily composed of pediatrics and family care These costs tend to be more predictable than those associated with other healthcare issues which predominantly affect the adult population LongTerm Services and Supports LTSS is a Medicaid product that covers InstitutionalResidential Care Nursing Facilities Intermediate Care Facilities and Home and Community Based Services HCBS for beneficiaries requiring assistance with their activities of daily living such as bathing dressing and transferring The most common HCBS services include personal care adult day care nonemergent transportation homedelivered meals and personal emergency response systems LTSS services are provided for individuals requiring nursing home level of care receiving waiver services or entitled to state Medicaid LTSS benefits The largest groups receiving LTSS by spending are older individuals and individuals with physical disabilities followed by individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities those with serious mental illness andor serious emotional disturbance and other populations States are increasingly turning to managed care as a solution to provide coordinated holistic care to their LTSS beneficiaries According to ADvancing States formerly National Association of States United for Aging and Disabilities as of November 2020 25 states utilize some form of managed LTSS up from eight in 2004 The majority of youth and children in foster care qualify for Medicaid most commonly through Title IVE of the Social Security Act which provides funding to support safe and stable outofhome care for children who are removed from their homes The federal government has enacted legislation establishing guidelines and requirements for state child welfare agencies related to the health and wellbeing of children in foster care including the provision of grants and technical assistance to enable states to meet these needs and make explicit connections with state Medicaid In addition the ACA requires states to make former foster care children eligible for Medicaid until they reach the age of 26 provided that they turned 18 while in foster care and were enrolled in Medicaid at that time CMS estimated the total Medicaid market to be approximately 649 billion in 2020 and estimates the market will grow to over 10 trillion by 2028 Medicaid spending is estimated to have increased by 45 in 2020 and is projected to increase at an average annual rate of 57 between 2020 and 2028 Due to the timing of the CMS report and highly uncertain nature of the pandemic the aforementioned projections do not take into account the impact of COVID19 A portion of Medicaid beneficiaries are dualeligible lowincome seniors and people with disabilities who are enrolled in both Medicaid and Medicare According to CMS there were approximately 110 million dualeligible enrollees in 2019 These dualeligible members may receive assistance from Medicaid for benefits such as nursing home care HCBS andor assistance with Medicare premiums and cost sharing Dualeligibles also use more services due to their tendency to have more chronic health issues We serve dualeligibles through our ABD LTSS MedicareMedicaid Plans MMP Medicare Advantage Dual Special Needs Plan DSNP and standard Medicare Advantage lines of business While Medicaid programs have directed funds to many individuals who cannot afford or otherwise maintain health insurance coverage they did not initially address the inefficient and costly manner in which the Medicaid population tends to access healthcare Medicaid recipients in nonmanaged care programs typically have not sought preventive care or routine treatment for chronic conditions such as asthma and diabetes Rather they have sought healthcare in hospital emergency departments which is typically more expensive As a result many states without managed care programs have found that the costs of providing Medicaid benefits have increased while the medical outcomes for the recipients remained unsatisfactory 2 Table of Contents We believe managed care has improved the quality of care for Medicaid beneficiaries and lowered costs The majority of states have mandated that their Medicaid recipients enroll in managed care plans Other states are considering moving to a mandated managed care approach for additional populations and products As a result we believe a significant market opportunity exists for managed care organizations with operations and programs focused on the distinct socioeconomic cultural and healthcare needs of the uninsured population and the Medicaid populations Medicare We contract with CMS under the Medicare Advantage program to provide Medicare Advantage products directly to Medicare beneficiaries as well as through employer and union groups The Medicare program provides health care coverage primarily to individuals age 65 or older as well as to individuals with certain disabilities We provide or arrange healthcare benefits for services normally covered by Medicare plus a broad range of healthcare benefits for services not covered by traditional Medicare usually in exchange for a fixed monthly premium per member from CMS that varies based upon the county in which the member resides demographic factors of the member such as age gender and institutionalized status and the health status of the member Any benefits that are not covered by Medicare may result in an additional monthly premium charged to the enrollee or through portions of payments received from CMS that may be allocated to these benefits according to CMS regulations and guidance Many of our Medicare Advantage members pay no monthly premium to us for these additional benefits As our Medicare Advantage members reach their deductibles and outofpocket maximums our medical costs rise creating seasonality in the business with a higher percentage of earnings in the first half of the year We provide a wide range of Medicare products including Medicare Advantage plans with and without prescription drug coverage and Medicare supplement products that supplement traditional feeforservice Medicare coverage Our subsidiaries have a number of contracts with CMS under the Medicare Advantage program authorized under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act CMS developed the Medicare Advantage Star ratings system to help consumers choose among competing plans awarding between 10 and 50 stars to Medicare Advantage plans based on performance in certain measures of quality The Star ratings are used by CMS to award quality bonus payments to Medicare Advantage plans Beginning with the 2014 Star ratings calculated in 2013 Medicare Advantage plans are required to achieve a minimum of 40 Stars to qualify for a quality bonus payment The methodology and measures included in the Star ratings system can be modified by CMS annually and Star ratings thresholds are based on performance of Medicare Advantage plans nationally CMS estimated the total Medicare market was approximately 859 billion in 2020 and estimates the market will grow to approximately 16 trillion by 2028 Medicare spending is estimated to have increased 72 in fiscal 2020 and is projected to increase at an average annual rate of 77 between 2020 and 2028 Medicare Prescription Drug Plan Through our acquisition of WellCare in January 2020 we now offer standalone PDP to Medicare beneficiaries We have contracted with CMS to serve as a plan sponsor offering standalone Medicare Part D PDP plans to Medicareeligible beneficiaries We offer PDPs in 50 states and the District of Columbia Our PDPs offer national innetwork prescription drug coverage including a preferred pharmacy network subject to limitations in certain circumstances Our PDP contracts with CMS are renewable for successive oneyear terms unless CMS notifies us of its decision not to renew by May 1 of the current contract year or we notify CMS of our decision not to renew by the first Monday in June of the contract year The Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit is supported by risk sharing with the federal government through risk corridors designed to limit the losses and gains of the participating drug plans and by reinsurance for catastrophic drug costs The government subsidy is based on the national weighted average monthly bid for this coverage adjusted for risk factor payments Additional subsidies are provided for duallyeligible beneficiaries and specified lowincome beneficiaries Commercial Established in 2010 and operational in 2014 the ACA created Health Insurance Marketplaces which are a key component of the ACA and provide an opportunity for individuals and families to obtain health insurance States have the option of operating 3 Table of Contents their own Marketplace or partnering with the federal government States choosing neither option currently default to a federallyfacilitated Marketplace Premium subsidies are available to make coverage more affordable Access to Marketplaces is limited to US citizens and legal immigrants Insurers are required to offer a minimum level of benefits with coverage that varies based on premiums and outofpocket costs Premium subsidies are provided to individuals and families without access to other coverage and with incomes generally between 100400 of the federal poverty level with some exceptions to help them purchase insurance through the Marketplaces These subsidies are offered on a sliding scale basis W e also offer commercial healthcare products to individuals through large and small employer groups We offer plans with differing benefit designs and varying levels of copayments at different premium rates These plans are offered generally through contracts with participating network physicians hospitals and other providers Coverage typically is subject to copays and can be subject to deductibles and coinsurance As our commercial members reach their deductibles and outofpocket maximums our medical costs rise creating seasonality in the business with a higher percentage of earnings in the first half of the year International We have a growing international presence in Spain the United Kingdom UK and Slovakia Our presence in Spain is mainly associated with our subsidiaries operating as part of the Ribera Salud Group which manages health administration concessions and private hospitals in various

include but are not limited to orthopedic surgeons cardiologists and otolaryngologists We also provide education and outreach programs to inform and assist members in accessing quality appropriate healthcare services Our health plans facilitate access to healthcare services for our members primarily through contracts with our providers Our contracts with primary and specialty care physicians and hospitals usually are for one to threeyear periods and renew automatically for successive oneyear terms but generally are subject to termination by either party upon prior written notice In the absence of a contract we typically pay providers at applicable state or federal reimbursement levels depending on the product eg Medicaid or Medicare We pay providers under a variety of methods including feeforservice capitation arrangements and valuebased arrangements  Under our feeforservice contracts with providers we pay a negotiated fee for covered services This model is characterized as having no financial risk for the provider  Under our capitated contracts providers can be paid a set amount for their services as outlined in their respective provider agreements A provider groups financial instability or failure to pay secondary providers for services rendered could lead secondary providers to demand payment from us even though we have made our regular capitated payments to the provider group Depending on state law and the regulatory environment it may be necessary for us to pay such claims  Under valuebased arrangements providers can be paid under either a capitated or feeforservice model The arrangement however contains provisions for additional payments to the providers or reimbursement from the providers based upon their performance in cost and quality measures

httpswwwcentenecomwhowearecorporatefactsreportshtml Nothing on our website including our Environmental Social Health and Governance Report or sections thereof shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual Report COMPETITION We operate in a highly competitive environment in an industry subject to ongoing significant changes including business consolidations new strategic alliances market pressures and regulatory and legislative reform both at the federal and state level This includes but is not limited to the federal and state healthcare reform legislation described under the heading Regulation In addition changes to the political environment may drive additional changes to the competitive landscape 13 Table of Contents In our business our principal competitors for customers members and providers consist of the following types of organizations   National and Regional Commercial Managed Care Organizations that focus on providing healthcare services to Medicaid Medicare and correctional members in addition to members in marketplace and private commercial plans These organizations consist of national and regional organizations as well as notforprofits and organizations that operate in a small geographic location and are owned by providers primarily hospitals Some of these organizations offer a range of specialty services including pharmacy benefits management behavioral health management population health management correctional healthcare management and nurse triage call support centers  Primary Care Case Management Programs that are established by the states through contracts with primary care providers Under these programs physicians provide primary care services to Medicaid recipients as well as limited population health management oversight  Accountable Care Organizations that consist of groups of doctors hospitals and other healthcare providers who come together to provide coordinated high quality care to their patients We compete with other Managed Care Organizations and specialty companies for state county federal and commercial contracts In addition the impact of the ACA and potential growth in our segment may attract new competitors including technology companies new joint ventures financial services firms consulting firms and other nontraditional competitors Before granting a contract state and federal government agencies consider many competitive factors These factors include quality of care financial condition stability and resources and established or scalable infrastructure with a demonstrated ability to deliver services and establish comprehensive provider networks Our specialty companies compete with other providers such as disease management companies individual health insurance companies and pharmacy benefits managers for nongovernmental contracts We also compete to enroll new members and retain existing members People who wish to enroll in a managed healthcare plan or to change healthcare plans typically choose a plan based on the quality of care and services offered ease of access to services a specific provider being part of the network and the availability of supplemental benefits We believe that the principal competitive features affecting our ability to retain and increase membership include the range and prices of benefit plans offered size and quality of provider network quality of service responsiveness to customer demands financial stability comprehensiveness of coverage diversity of product offerings market presence and reputation We also compete with other managed care organizations in establishing provider networks When contracting with various health plans we believe that providers consider existing and potential member volume reimbursement rates population health management programs speed of reimbursement and administrative service capabilities See Risk Factors  Competition may limit our ability to increase penetration of the markets that we serve  The relative importance of each of the aforementioned competitive factors and the identity of our key competitors varies by market including by geography and by product We believe that we compete effectively against other healthcare industry participants REGULATION Our operations are comprehensively regulated at the local state and federal levels Government regulation of the provision of healthcare products and services is a changing area of law that varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction States have implemented National Association of Insurance Commissioners NAIC model regulations requiring governance practices and risk and solvency assessment reporting States have adopted these or similar measures to enhance regulations relating to corporate governance and internal controls of health maintenance organizations HMOs and insurance companies We are required to maintain a risk management framework and file reports with state insurance regulators Regulatory agencies generally have substantial discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules Changes in the regulatory environment and applicable laws and rules also may occur periodically including in connection with changes in political party or administration at the state and federal levels The ultimate content timing or effect of any potential future legislation enacted under the new administration remains uncertain Our regulated subsidiaries are licensed to operate as HMOs preferred provider organizations PPOs third party administrators utilization review organizations pharmacies direct care providers andor insurance companies in their respective states In each of the jurisdictions in which we operate we are regulated by the relevant insurance health andor human services departments 14 Table of Contents departments of insurance boards of pharmacy and other healthcare providers and departments of health that oversee the activities of managed care organizations and health plans providing or arranging to provide services to enrollees The process for obtaining authorization to operate as a managed care organization health insurance plan prescription drug plan pharmacy or provider organization is complex and requires us to demonstrate to the regulators the adequacy of the health plans organizational structure financial resources utilization review quality assurance programs proper billing complaint procedures and an adequate provider network and procedures for covering emergency medical conditions For example under both state managed care organization statutes and insurance laws our health plan subsidiaries as well as our applicable specialty companies must comply with minimum statutory capital and other financial solvency requirements such as deposit and surplus requirements Insurance regulations may also require prior state approval of acquisitions of other managed care organization businesses and the payment of dividends as well as notice for loans or the transfer of funds Our subsidiaries are also subject to periodic state and federal reporting requirements In addition each health plan and individual healthcare provider must meet criteria to secure the approval of state regulatory authorities before implementing certain operational changes including without limitation changes to existing offerings the development of new product offerings certain organizational restructurings and in some states the expansion of service areas States have adopted a number of regulations that may affect our business and results of operations These regulations in certain states include  premium taxes or similar assessments imposed on us  stringent prompt payment laws requiring us to pay claims within a specified period of time  disclosure requirements regarding provider fee schedules and coding procedures and  programs to monitor and supervise the activities and financial solvency of provider groups We are regulated as an insurance holding company and are subject to the insurance holding company acts of the states in which our insurance company and HMO subsidiaries are domiciled These acts contain certain reporting requirements as well as restrictions on transactions between an insurer or HMO and its affiliates These holding company laws and regulations generally require insurance companies and HMOs within an insurance holding company system to register with the insurance department of each state where they are domiciled and to file with those states insurance departments reports describing capital structure ownership financial condition intercompany transactions and general business operations In addition depending on the size and nature of the transaction there are various notice and reporting requirements that generally apply to transactions between insurance companies and HMOs and their affiliates within an insurance holding company structure Some insurance holding company laws and regulations require prior regulatory approval or in certain circumstances prior notice of certain material intercompany transfers of assets as well as certain transactions between insurance companies HMOs their parent holding companies and affiliates Among other provisions state insurance and HMO laws may restrict the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends Additionally the holding company regulations of the states in which our subsidiaries are domiciled restrict the ability of any person to obtain control of an insurance company or HMO without prior regulatory approval Under those statutes without such approval or an exemption no person may acquire any voting security of an insurance holding company which controls an insurance company or HMO or merge with such a holding company if as a result of such transaction such person would control the insurance holding company Control is generally defined as the direct or indirect power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a company and is presumed to exist if a person directly or indirectly owns or controls 10 or more of the voting securities of a company PPO regulation also varies by state and covers all or most of the subject area referred to above Our pharmacies must be licensed to do business as pharmacies in the states in which they are located Our pharmacies must also register with the US Drug Enforcement Administration and individual state controlled substance authorities to dispense controlled substances In many of the states where our pharmacies deliver pharmaceuticals there are laws and regulations that require outofstate mail order pharmacies to register with that states board of pharmacy or similar regulatory body These states generally permit the pharmacy to follow the laws of the state in which the mail order pharmacy is located although some states require that we also comply with certain laws in that state Our healthcare providers must be licensed to practice medicine and do business as care providers in the state in which they are located In addition they must be in good standing with the applicable medical board board of nursing or other applicable entity Furthermore they cannot be excluded from participation at either the state or federal levels Our facilities are periodically reviewed by state departments of health and other regulatory agencies to ensure the environment is safe to provide care 15 Table of Contents Federal law has also implemented other health programs that are partially funded by the federal government such as the Medicaid and Medicare programs Our Medicaid programs are regulated and administered by various state regulatory bodies Federal funding remains critical to the viability of these programs Federal law permits the federal government to oversee and in some cases to enact regulations and other requirements that must be followed by states with respect to these programs Medicaid is administered at the federal level by CMS Comprehensive legislation specifically Title XVIII of the Social Security Act governs our Medicare program In addition our Medicare contracts are subject to regulation by CMS CMS has the right to audit Medicare contractors and the healthcare providers and administrative contractors who provide certain services on their behalf to determine the quality of care being rendered and the degree of compliance with CMS contracts and regulations The ACA transformed the US healthcare system through a series of complex initiatives Some of the ACAs most significant provisions include the imposition of significant fees assessments and taxes including the nondeductible tax technically called a fee on health insurers based on prior year net premiums written the health insurer fee or HIF the establishment of federallyfacilitated and statebased Health Insurance Marketplaces where individuals and small groups may purchase health coverage the implementation of certain premium stabilization programs designed to apportion risk amongst insurers and the optional Medicaid Expansion State and federal regulators have continued to provide additional guidance and specificity to the ACA and we continue to monitor this new information and evaluate its potential impact on our business In December 2018 a partial summary judgment ruling in Texas v United States of America held that the ACAs individual mandate requirement was essential to the ACA and without it the remainder of the ACA was invalid ie that it was not severable from the ACA That decision was appealed to the Fifth Circuit which ruled in December 2019 that the individual mandate was unconstitutional after Congress eliminated the individual mandate penalty and remanded the case to the district court for additional analysis on the question of severability The Supreme Court heard oral arguments in November 2020 and a ruling is anticipated in 2021 The ACA remains in effect until judicial review of the decision is concluded For a further discussion of the ACA see Risk Factors  The implementation of the ACA as well as potential repeal of changes to or judicial challenges to the ACA could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows  We must also comply with laws and regulations related to the award administration and performance of US Government contracts Government contract laws and regulations affect how we do business with our customers and in some instances impose added costs on our business Money laundering is a method of attempting to conceal the origins of money gained through illegal activity and is itself a crime that can result in substantial criminal and civil sanctions including fines and imprisonment To ensure compliance with antimoney laundering laws and regulations it is our policy to conduct business only with legitimate customers and counterparties whose funds are derived from legitimate commercial activity In addition as a result of our international operations we are also subject to the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act FCPA and similar worldwide anticorruption laws including the UK Bribery Act of 2010 which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to nonUS officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business A violation of specific laws and regulations by us andor our agents could result in among other things the imposition of fines and penalties on us changes to our business practices the termination of our contracts or debarment from bidding on contracts State and Federal Contracts In addition to being a licensed insurance company or HMO in order to be a Medicaid managed care organization in each of the states in which we operate we generally must operate under a contract with the states Medicaid agency States generally either use a formal proposal process reviewing a number of bidders or award individual contracts to qualified applicants that apply for entry to the program Under these state Medicaid program contracts we receive monthly payments based on specified capitation rates determined on an actuarial basis These rates differ by membership category and by state depending on the specific benefits and policies adopted by each state In addition several of our Medicaid contracts require us to maintain Medicare Advantage special needs plans which are regulated by CMS for dual eligible individuals within the state We provide Medicare Advantage PDPs DSNPs and MMP which are provided under contracts with CMS and subject to federal regulation regarding the award administration and performance of such contracts CMS also has the right to audit our

CMS A health plan is also subject to periodic comprehensive quality assurance evaluations by a thirdparty reviewing organization and generally by the insurance department of the jurisdiction that licenses the health plan A health plan or individual health insurance provider must also submit reports to various regulatory agencies including quarterly and annual statutory financial statements and utilization reports Our health plans operate through individual state contracts generally with an initial term of one to five years The contracts often have renewal or extension terms or are renewable through the states reprocurement process The contracts generally are subject to termination for cause an event of default or lack of funding among other things Marketplace Contracts We operate in 22 states under federallyfacilitated marketplace contracts with CMS and statebased exchanges Both contract types are renewable on an annual basis We operate under a contract with the Arkansas Department

Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health HITECH Act amended certain provisions of HIPAA and enhanced data security obligations for covered entities and their business associates HITECH also mandated individual notifications in instances of a data breach provided enhanced penalties for HIPAA violations and granted enforcement 17 Table of Contents authority to states Attorneys General in addition to the HHS Office for Civil Rights The HIPAA Omnibus Rule further enhanced the changes under the HITECH Acts and the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 GINA which clarified that genetic information is protected under HIPAA and prohibits most health plans from using or disclosing genetic information for underwriting purposes These regulations also establish significant criminal penalties and civil sanctions for noncompliance The preemption provisions of HIPAA provide that the federal standards will not preempt state laws that are more stringent than the related federal requirements The Privacy and Security Rules and HITECHOmnibus enhancements established requirements to protect the privacy of medical records and safeguard personal health information maintained and used by healthcare providers health plans healthcare clearinghouses and their business associates The Security Rule requires healthcare providers health plans healthcare clearinghouses and their business associates to implement administrative physical and technical safeguards to ensure the privacy and confidentiality of health information electronically stored maintained or

Under HIPAA health plans and providers are required to have the capacity to accept and send all covered transactions in a standardized electronic format Penalties can be imposed for failure to comply with these requirements The transaction standards were modified in October 2015 with the implementation of the ICD10 coding system In addition we process and maintain personal card data particularly in connection with our Marketplace business As a result we must maintain compliance with the Payment Card Industry PCI Data Security Standard which is a multifaceted security standard intended to optimize the security of credit debit and cash card transactions and protect cardholders against misuse of their personal information Other Fraud Waste and Abuse Laws Investigating and prosecuting healthcare fraud waste and abuse continues to be a top priority for state and federal law enforcement entities The focus of these efforts has been directed at Medicare Medicaid Health Insurance Marketplace and commercial products The fraud waste and abuse laws include the federal False Claims Act which prohibits the known filing of a false claim or the known use of false statements to obtain payment from the federal government Many states have false claim act statutes that closely resemble the federal False Claims Act Additional fraud waste and abuse prohibitions include a wide range of operating activities such as kickbacks or other inducements for referral of members or for the coverage of products such as prescription drugs by a plan billing for unnecessary medical services by a provider improper marketing and violation of patient privacy rights The laws and regulations relating to fraud waste and abuse and the requirements applicable to health plans PDPs and providers participating in these programs are complex and change regularly Compliance with these laws may require substantial resources We are constantly looking for ways to improve our fraud waste and abuse detection methods While we have both prospective and retrospective processes to identify abusive patterns and fraudulent billing we continue to increase our capabilities to proactively detect inappropriate billing prior to payment HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES As the pace of change complexity and uncertainty in the broader environment accelerates we continue our strong investment in creating a

this filing including our consolidated financial statements and related notes The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we currently believe may materially affect our Company Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we currently deem immaterial also may become important factors that affect our Company Unless the context otherwise requires the terms the Company we us our or similar terms and Centene i prior to the closing of the Magellan Acquisition refer to Centene Corporation together with its consolidated subsidiaries without giving effect to the Magellan Acquisition and ii upon and after the closing of the Magellan Acquisition refer to us after giving effect to the Magellan Acquisition Risks Relating to Our Business Our business could be adversely affected by the effects of widespread public health pandemics such as the spread of COVID19  Public health pandemics or widespread outbreaks of contagious diseases could adversely impact our business In December 2019 a novel strain of coronavirus COVID19 emerged which has now spread globally including throughout the United States The extent to which COVID19 continues to impact our business will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence Factors that may determine the severity of the impact include the duration and scale of the outbreak new information which may emerge concerning the severity of COVID19 including new strains which may be more contagious more severe or less responsive to treatment or vaccines the costs of prevention and treatment of COVID19 and the potential that we will not receive state and federal government reimbursement of additional expenses incurred by our members who contract or require testing for COVID19 or who experience other health impacts as a result of the pandemic employee mobility productivity and utilization of leave and other benefits financial and other impacts on the healthcare provider community disruptions or delays in the supply chain for testing and treatment supplies protective equipment and other products and services and the actions to contain COVID19 or address its impact including federal state and local laws regulations and emergency orders including directives to remain at home physically distance or forced business closures as well as the timing and scope of vaccine distribution among others Additionally the spread of COVID19 has led to disruption and volatility in the global capital markets which could adversely impact our access to capital and a decline in interest rates which could reduce our investment income Finally the impact of the above items on our state and federal partners could result in program changes or delays or reduced capitation payments to us We cannot at this time predict the ultimate impact of the COVID19 pandemic but it could adversely affect our business including our financial position results of operations andor cash flows Our Medicare programs are subject to a variety of unique risks that could adversely impact our financial results If we fail to design and maintain programs that are attractive to Medicare participants if our Medicare operations are subject to negative outcomes from program audits sanctions penalties or other actions if we do not submit adequate bids in our existing markets or any expansion markets if our existing contracts are modified or terminated or if we fail to maintain or improve our quality Star ratings our current Medicare business and our ability to expand our Medicare operations could be materially and adversely affected negatively impacting our financial performance For example in October 2020 the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services CMS published updated Medicare Star quality ratings for the 2021 rating year Approximately 30 of our Medicare members are in a 4 star or above plan for the 2022 bonus year compared to 46 for the 2021 bonus year and 86 for the 2020 bonus year Our quality bonus and rebates may be negatively impacted in 2021 and 2022 and the attractiveness of our Medicare Advantage plans may be reduced There are also specific additional risks under Title XVIII Part D of the Social Security Act associated with our provision of Medicare Part D prescription drug benefits as part of our Medicare Advantage plan offerings These risks include potential uncollectibility of receivables inadequacy of pricing assumptions inability to receive and process information and increased pharmaceutical costs as well as the underlying seasonality of this business and extended settlement periods for claims submissions Our failure to comply with Part D program requirements can result in financial andor operational sanctions on our Part D products as well as on our Medicare Advantage products that offer no prescription drug coverage Although we do not anticipate that a singlepayer national health insurance system will be enacted by the current Congress members of Congress have proposed several legislative initiatives over various sessions of Congress that would establish some 23 Table of Contents form of a single public or quasipublic agency that organizes healthcare financing but under which healthcare delivery would remain private Additionally the potential impact of the change of administration on healthcare reform efforts is unknown We are unable to predict the nature and success of these or other initiatives or political changes which could have an adverse effect on our business Failure to accurately estimate and price our medical expenses or effectively manage our medical costs or related administrative costs could negatively affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows Our profitability depends to a significant degree on our ability to estimate and effectively manage expenses related to health benefits through among other things our ability to contract favorably with hospitals physicians and other healthcare providers For example our Medicaid revenue is often based on bids submitted before the start of the initial contract year If our actual medical expenses exceed our estimates our Health Benefits Ratio HBR or our expenses related to medical services as a percentage of premium revenues would increase and our profits would decline Because of the narrow margins of our health plan business relatively small changes in our HBR can create significant changes in our financial results Changes in healthcare regulations and practices the level of utilization of healthcare services hospital and pharmaceutical costs disasters the potential effects of climate change major epidemics pandemics or newly emergent diseases such as COVID19 new medical technologies new pharmaceutical compounds increases in provider fraud and other external factors including general economic conditions such as inflation and unemployment levels are generally beyond our control and could reduce our ability to accurately predict and effectively control the costs of providing health benefits Also member behavior could continue to be influenced by the uncertainty surrounding the ACA including ongoing legal challenges to the ACA including the case originally captioned Texas v United States which is currently pending before the Supreme Court Our medical expenses include claims reported but not paid estimates for claims incurred but not reported and estimates for the costs necessary to process unpaid claims at the end of each period Our development of the medical claims liability estimate is a continuous process which we monitor and refine on a monthly basis as claims receipts and payment information as well as inpatient acuity information becomes available As more complete information becomes available we adjust the amount of the estimate and include the changes in estimates in medical expenses in the period in which the changes are identified Given the uncertainties inherent in such estimates there can be no assurance that our medical claims liability estimate will be adequate and any adjustments to the estimate may unfavorably impact our results of operations and may be material Additionally when we commence operations in a new state or region or launch a new product we have limited information with which to estimate our medical claims liability For a period of time after the inception of the new business we base our estimates on governmentprovided historical actuarial data and limited actual incurred and received claims and inpatient acuity information The addition of new categories of eligible individuals as well as evolving Health Insurance Marketplace plans may pose difficulty in estimating our medical claims liability From time to time in the past our actual results have varied from our estimates particularly in times of significant changes in the number of our members If it is determined that our estimates are significantly different than actual results our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected In addition if there is a significant delay in our receipt of premiums our business operations cash flows or earnings could be negatively impacted Riskadjustment payment systems make our revenue and results of operations more difficult to estimate and could result in retroactive adjustments that have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows Most of our government customers employ riskadjustment models to determine the premium amount they pay for each member This model pays more for members with predictably higher costs according to the health status of each beneficiary enrolled Premium payments are generally established at fixed intervals according to the contract terms and then adjusted on a retroactive basis We reassess the estimates of the risk adjustment settlements each reporting period and any resulting adjustments are made to premium revenue In addition revisions by our government customers to the riskadjustment models have reduced and may continue to reduce our premium revenue As a result of the variability of certain factors that determine estimates for riskadjusted premiums including plan risk scores the actual amount of retroactive payments could be materially more or less than our estimates Consequently our estimate of our plans risk scores for any period and any resulting change in our accrual of premium revenues related thereto could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows The data provided to our government customers to determine the risk score are subject to audit by them even after the annual settlements occur These audits may result in the refund of premiums to the government customer previously received by us which could be significant and would reduce our premium revenue in the year that repayment is required 24 Table of Contents Government customers have performed and continue to perform audits of selected plans to validate the provider coding practices under the risk adjustment model used to calculate the premium paid for each member In 2018 CMS proposed the removal of the fee for service adjuster from the risk adjustment data validation audit methodology If adopted this proposal or any similar CMS rule making initiative could increase our audit error scores We anticipate that CMS will continue to conduct audits of our Medicare contracts and contract years on an ongoing basis An audit may result in the refund of premiums to CMS It is likely that a payment adjustment could occur as a result of these audits and any such adjustment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows Any failure to adequately price products offered or any reduction in products offered in the Health Insurance Marketplaces may have a negative impact on our results of operations financial position and cash flow Due to among other things the elimination of the individual mandate penalty in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act TCJA we may be adversely selected by individuals who have higher acuity levels than those individuals who selected us in the past and healthy individuals may decide to opt out of the pool altogether In addition the risk adjustment provisions of the ACA established to apportion risk amongst insurers may not be effective in appropriately mitigating the financial risks related to the Marketplace product are subject to a high degree of estimation and variability and are affected by our members acuity relative to the membership acuity of other insurers Further changes in the competitive marketplace over time may exacerbate the uncertainty in these relatively new markets For example competitors seeking to gain a foothold in the changing market may introduce pricing that we may not be able to match which may adversely affect our ability to compete effectively Competitors may also choose to exit the market altogether or otherwise suffer financial difficulty which could adversely impact the pool of potential insured or require us to increase premium rates Any significant variation from our expectations regarding acuity enrollment levels adverse selection or other assumptions utilized in setting adequate premium rates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows We derive a portion of our cash flow and gross margin from our PDP operations for which we submit annual bids for participation The results of our bids could materially affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows A significant portion of our PDP membership is obtained from the autoassignment of beneficiaries in CMSdesignated regions where our PDP premium bids are below benchmarks of other plans bids In general our premium bids are based on assumptions regarding PDP membership utilization drug costs drug rebates and other factors for each region Our 2021 PDP bids resulted in 33 of the 34 CMS regions in which we were below the benchmarks and within the de minimis range in the remaining region compared with our 2020 PDP bids in which we were below the benchmarks in 32 regions and within the de minimis range in the remaining two regions For those regions in which we are within the de minimis range we will not be eligible to have new members autoassigned to us but we will not lose our existing autoassigned membership If our future Part D premium bids are not below the CMS benchmarks we risk losing PDP members who were previously assigned to us and we may not have additional PDP members autoassigned to us which could materially reduce our revenue and profits Our encounter data may be inaccurate or incomplete which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition cash flows and ability to bid for and continue to participate in certain programs Our contracts require the submission of complete and correct encounter data The accurate and timely reporting of encounter data is increasingly important to the success of our programs because more states are using encounter data to determine compliance with performance standards and to set premium rates We have expended and may continue to expend additional effort and incur significant additional costs to collect or correct inaccurate or incomplete encounter data and have been and continue to be exposed to operating sanctions and financial fines and penalties for noncompliance In some instances our government clients have established retroactive requirements for the encounter data we must submit There also may be periods of time in which we are unable to meet existing requirements In either case it may be prohibitively expensive or impossible for us to collect or reconstruct this historical data We may experience challenges in obtaining complete and accurate encounter data due to difficulties with providers and thirdparty vendors submitting claims in a timely fashion in the proper format and with state agencies in coordinating such submissions As states increase their reliance on encounter data these difficulties could adversely affect the premium rates we receive and how membership is assigned to us and subject us to financial penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition cash flows and our ability to bid for and continue to participate in certain programs 25 Table of Contents If any of our government contracts are terminated or are not renewed on favorable terms or at all or if we receive an adverse finding or review resulting from an audit or investigation our business may be adversely affected A substantial portion of our business relates to the provision of managed care programs and selected services to individuals receiving benefits under governmental assistance or entitlement programs We provide these and other healthcare services under contracts with government entities in the areas in which we operate Our government contracts are generally intended to run for a fixed number of years and may be extended for an additional specified number of years if the contracting entity or its agent elects to do so When our contracts with government entities expire they may be opened for bidding by competing healthcare providers and there is no guarantee that our contracts will be renewed or extended Competitors may buy their way into the market by submitting bids with lower pricing Even if our responsive bids are successful the bids may be based upon assumptions or other factors which could result in the contracts being less profitable than we had anticipated Further our government contracts contain certain provisions regarding eligibility enrollment and disenrollment processes for covered services eligible providers periodic financial and informational reporting quality assurance timeliness of claims payment and agreement to maintain a Medicare plan in the state and financial standards among other things and are subject to cancellation if we fail to perform in accordance with the standards set by regulatory agencies We are also subject to various reviews audits and investigations to verify our compliance with the terms of our contracts with various governmental agencies as well as compliance with applicable laws and regulations Any adverse review audit or investigation could result in among other things cancellation of our contracts refunding of amounts we have been paid pursuant to our contracts imposition of fines penalties and other sanctions on us loss of our right to participate in various programs increased difficulty in selling our products and services loss of one or more of our licenses lowered quality Star ratings or required changes to the way we do business In addition under government procurement regulations and practices a negative determination resulting from a government audit of our business practices could result in a contractor being fined debarred andor suspended from being able to bid on or be awarded new government contracts for a period of time If any of our government contracts are terminated not renewed renewed on less favorable terms or not renewed on a timely basis or if we receive an adverse finding or review resulting from an audit or investigation our business and reputation may be adversely impacted our goodwill could be impaired and our financial position results of operations or cash flows may be materially affected We contract with independent thirdparty vendors and service providers who provide services to us and our subsidiaries or to whom we delegate selected functions Violations of or noncompliance with laws and regulations governing our business by such third parties or governing our dealings with such parties could among other things subject us to additional audits reviews and investigations and other adverse effects Ineffectiveness of stateoperated systems and subcontractors could adversely affect our business A number of our health plans rely on other stateoperated systems or subcontractors to qualify solicit educate and assign eligible members into managed care plans The effectiveness of these state operations and subcontractors can have a material effect on a health plans enrollment in a particular month or over an extended period When a state implements either new programs to determine eligibility or new processes to assign or enroll eligible members into health plans or when it chooses new subcontractors there is an increased potential for an unanticipated impact on the overall number of members assigned to managed care plans Execution of our growth strategy may increase costs or liabilities or create disruptions in our business Our growth strategy includes without limitation the acquisition and expansion of health plans participating in government sponsored healthcare programs and specialty services businesses contract rights and related assets of other health plans both in our existing service areas and in new markets and startup operations in new markets or new products in existing markets We continue to pursue opportunistic acquisitions to expand into new geographies and complementary business lines as well as to augment existing operations and we may be in discussions with respect to one or multiple targets at any given time Although we review the records of companies or businesses we plan to acquire it is possible that we could assume unanticipated liabilities or adverse operating conditions or an acquisition may not perform as well as expected or may not achieve timely profitability We also face the risk that we will not be able to effectively integrate acquisitions into our existing operations effectively without substantial expense delay or other operational or financial problems and we may need to divert more management resources to integration than we planned 26 Table of Contents In connection with startup operations and system migrations we may incur significant expenses prior to commencement of operations and the receipt of revenue For example in order to obtain a certificate of authority in most jurisdictions we must first establish a provider network have systems in place and demonstrate our ability to administer a state contract and process claims We may experience delays in operational start dates including those related to stayathome directives and other impacts of COVID19 As a result of these factors startup operations may decrease our profitability The timing of operating our new East Coast headquarters in Charlotte and the expected benefits of its completion may also be negatively impacted as a result of these factors In addition we are planning to further expand our business internationally and we will be subject to additional risks including but not limited to political risk an unfamiliar regulatory regime currency exchange risk and exchange controls cultural and language differences foreign tax issues and different labor laws and practices If we are unable to effectively execute our growth strategy including as a result of the continued impact of COVID19 our future growth will suffer and our results of operations could be harmed If competing managed care programs are unwilling to purchase specialty services from us we may not be able to successfully implement our strategy of diversifying our business lines We are seeking to diversify our business lines into areas that complement our government sponsored health plan business in order to grow our revenue stream and diversify our business In order to diversify our business we must succeed in selling the services of our specialty subsidiaries not only to our managed care plans but to programs operated by third parties Some of these thirdparty programs may compete with us in some markets and they therefore may be unwilling to purchase specialty services from us In any event the offering of these services will require marketing activities that differ significantly from the manner in which we seek to increase revenues from our government sponsored programs Our ineffectiveness in marketing specialty services to third parties may impair our ability to execute our business strategy If state regulators do not approve payments of dividends and distributions by our subsidiaries to us we may not have sufficient funds to implement our business strategy We principally operate through our health plan subsidiaries As part of normal operations we may make requests for dividends and distributions from our subsidiaries to fund our operations In addition to state corporate law limitations these subsidiaries are subject to more stringent state insurance and HMO laws and regulations that limit the amount of dividends and distributions that can be paid to us without prior approval of or notification to state regulators If these regulators were to deny or delay our subsidiaries requests to pay dividends the funds available to us would be limited which could harm our ability to implement our business strategy We derive a significant portion of our premium revenues from operations in a limited number of states and our results of operations financial position or cash flows could be materially affected by a decrease in premium revenues or profitability in any one of those states Operations in a limited number of states have accounted for a significant portion of our premium revenues to date If we were unable to continue to operate in any of those states or if our current operations in any portion of one of those states were significantly curtailed our revenues could decrease materially Our reliance on operations in a limited number of states could cause our revenues and profitability to change suddenly and unexpectedly depending on legislative or other governmental or regulatory actions and decisions economic conditions and similar factors in those states For example states we currently serve may open the bidding for their Medicaid program to other health insurers through a request for proposal process Our inability to continue to operate in any of the states in which we operate could harm our business Competition may limit our ability to increase penetration of the markets that we serve We compete for members principally on the basis of size and quality of provider networks benefits provided and quality of service We compete with numerous types of competitors including other health plans and traditional state Medicaid programs that reimburse providers as care is provided as well as technology companies new joint ventures financial services firms consulting firms and other nontraditional competitors In addition the administration of the ACA has the potential to shift the competitive landscape in our segment Some of the health plans with which we compete have greater financial and other resources and offer a broader scope of products than we do In addition significant merger and acquisition activity has occurred in the managed care industry as well as complementary industries such as the hospital physician pharmaceutical medical device and health information systems businesses To the extent that competition intensifies in any market that we serve as a result of industry consolidation or otherwise our ability to retain or increase members and providers or maintain or increase our revenue growth pricing 27 Table of Contents flexibility and control over medical cost trends may be adversely affected If we are unable to maintain relationships with our provider networks our profitability may be harmed Our profitability depends in large part upon our ability to contract at competitive prices with hospitals physicians and other healthcare providers Our provider arrangements with our primary care physicians specialists and hospitals generally may be canceled by either party without cause upon 90 to 120 days prior written notice We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to continue to renew our existing contracts or enter into new contracts on a timely basis or under favorable terms enabling us to service our members profitably Healthcare providers with whom we contract may not properly manage the costs of and access to services be able to provide effective telehealth services maintain financial solvency including due to the impact of COVID19 or avoid disputes with other providers Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our operations In any particular market physicians and other healthcare providers could refuse to contract demand higher payments or take other actions that could result in higher medical costs or difficulty in meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements among other things In some markets certain healthcare providers particularly hospitals physicianhospital organizations or multispecialty physician groups may have significant market positions or near monopolies that could result in diminished bargaining power on our part In addition accountable care organizations practice management companies which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency and marketing leverage and other organizational structures that physicians hospitals and other healthcare providers choose may change the way in which these providers interact with us and may change the competitive landscape Such organizations or groups of healthcare providers may compete directly with us which could adversely affect our operations and our results of operations financial position and cash flows by impacting our relationships with these providers or affecting the way that we price our products and estimate our costs which might require us to incur costs to change our operations Provider networks may consolidate resulting in a reduction in the competitive environment In addition if these providers refuse to contract with us use their market position to negotiate contracts unfavorable to us or place us at a competitive disadvantage our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be materially and adversely affected From time to time healthcare providers assert or threaten to assert claims seeking to terminate noncancelable agreements due to alleged actions or inactions by us If we are unable to retain our current provider contract terms or enter into new provider contracts timely or on favorable terms our profitability may be harmed In addition from time to time we may be subject to class action or other lawsuits by healthcare providers with respect to claim payment procedures or similar matters For example our wholly owned subsidiary Health Net Life Insurance Company HNL is and may continue to be subject to such disputes with respect to HNLs payment levels in connection with the processing of outofnetwork provider reimbursement claims for the provision of certain substance abuse related services HNL expects to vigorously defend its claims payment practices Nevertheless in the event HNL receives an adverse finding in any related legal proceeding or from a regulator or is otherwise required to reimburse providers for these claims at rates that are higher than expected or for claims HNL otherwise believes are unallowable our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected In addition regardless of whether any such lawsuits brought against us are successful or have merit they will still be timeconsuming and costly and could distract our managements attention As a result under such circumstances we may incur significant expenses and may be unable to operate our business effectively If we are unable to integrate and manage our information systems effectively our operations could be disrupted Our operations depend significantly on effective information systems The information gathered and processed by our information systems assists us in among other things monitoring utilization and other cost factors processing provider claims and providing data to our regulators Our healthcare providers also depend upon our information systems for membership verifications claims status and other information Our information systems and applications require continual maintenance upgrading and enhancement to meet our operational needs and regulatory requirements We regularly upgrade and expand our information systems capabilities If we experience difficulties with the transition to or from information systems or do not appropriately integrate maintain enhance or expand our information systems we could suffer among other things operational disruptions loss of existing members and difficulty in attracting new members regulatory problems and increases in administrative expenses In addition our ability to integrate and manage our information systems may be impaired as the result of events outside our control including acts of nature such as earthquakes or fires or acts of terrorists which may include cyberattacks by terrorists or other governmental or nongovernmental actors In addition we may from time to time obtain significant portions of our systemsrelated or other services or facilities from independent third parties which may make our operations vulnerable if such third parties fail to perform adequately 28 Table of Contents An impairment charge with respect to our recorded goodwill and intangible assets could have a material impact on our results of operations We periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may be impaired in which case a charge to earnings may be necessary Changes in business strategy government regulations or economic or market conditions have resulted and may result in impairments of our goodwill and other intangible assets at any time in the future Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on among other things legal factors market conditions and operational performance For example the nonrenewal of our health plan contracts with the state in which they operate may be an indicator of impairment If an event or events occur that would cause us to revise our estimates and assumptions used in analyzing the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets such revision could result in a noncash impairment charge that could have a material impact on our results of operations in the period in which the impairment occurs A failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure or those of third parties with which we do business including as a result of cyberattacks could have an adverse effect on our business Information security risks have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct our operations and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime hackers terrorists and other external parties including foreign state agents Our operations rely on the secure processing transmission and storage of confidential proprietary and other information in our computer systems and networks Security breaches may arise from external or internal threats External breaches include hacking personal information for financial gain attempting to cause harm or interruption to our operations or intending to obtain competitive information We experience attempted external hacking or malicious attacks on a regular basis We maintain a rigorous system of prevention and detection controls through our security programs however our prevention and detection controls may not prevent or identify all such attacks on a timely basis or at all Internal breaches may result from inappropriate security access to confidential information by rogue employees consultants or third party service providers Any security breach involving the misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential member information financial data competitively sensitive information or other proprietary data whether by us or a third party could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation financial condition cash flows or results of operations Risks Relating to Regulatory and Legal Matters Reductions in funding changes to eligibility requirements for government sponsored healthcare programs in which we participate and any inability on our part to effectively adapt to changes to these programs could substantially affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows The majority of our revenues come from government subsidized healthcare programs including Medicaid Medicare TRICARE CHIP LTSS ABD Foster Care and Health Insurance Marketplace premiums Under most programs the base premium rate paid for each program differs depending on a combination of factors such as defined upper payment limits a members health status age gender county or region and benefit mix Since Medicaid was created in 1965 the federal government and the states have shared the costs for this program with the federal share currently averaging approximately 60 We are therefore exposed to risks associated with federal and state government contracting or participating in programs involving a government payor including but not limited to the general ability of the federal andor state governments to terminate or modify contracts with them in whole or in part without prior notice for convenience or for default based on performance potential regulatory or legislative action that may materially modify amounts owed our dependence upon Congressional or legislative appropriation and allotment of funds and the impact that delays in government payments could have on our operating cash flow and liquidity and other regulatory legislative or judicial actions that may have an impact on the operations of government subsidized healthcare programs including ongoing litigation involving the ACA For example future levels of funding and premium rates may be affected by continuing government efforts to contain healthcare costs and may further be affected by state and federal budgetary constraints Governments periodically consider reducing or reallocating the amount of money they spend for Medicaid Medicare TRICARE CHIP LTSS ABD and Foster Care Furthermore Medicare remains subject to the automatic spending reductions imposed by the Budget Control Act of 2011 and the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 sequestration subject to a 2 cap which was extended by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 through 2029 The Coronavirus Aid Relief and Economic Security Act of 2020 temporarily suspended the Medicare sequestration for the period of May 1 2020 through December 31 2020 while also extending the mandatory sequestration policy by an additional one year through 2030 The BipartisanBicameral Omnibus COVID Relief Deal passed in December 2020 further extended the suspension of the Medicare sequestration until March 31 2021 29 Table of Contents In addition reductions in defense spending could have an adverse impact on certain government programs in which we currently participate by among other things terminating or materially changing such programs or by decreasing or delaying payments made under such programs Adverse economic conditions may put pressures on state budgets as tax and other state revenues decrease while the population that is eligible to participate in these programs remains steady or increases creating more need for funding We anticipate this will require government agencies to find funding alternatives which may result in reductions in funding for programs contraction of covered benefits and limited or no premium rate increases or premium rate decreases A reduction or less than expected increase a protracted delay or a change in allocation methodology in government funding for these programs as well as termination of one or more contracts for the convenience of the government may materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows In addition if another federal government shutdown were to occur for a prolonged period of time federal government payment obligations including its obligations under Medicaid Medicare TRICARE CHIP LTSS ABD Foster Care and the Health Insurance Marketplaces may be delayed Similarly if state government shutdowns were to occur state payment obligations may be delayed If the federal or state governments fail to make payments under these programs on a timely basis our business could suffer and our financial position results of operations or cash flows may be materially affected Payments from government payors may be delayed in the future which if extended for any significant period of time could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position cash flows or liquidity In addition delays in obtaining or failure to obtain or maintain governmental approvals or moratoria imposed by regulatory authorities could adversely affect our revenues or membership increase costs or adversely affect our ability to bring new products to market as forecasted Other changes to our government programs could affect our willingness or ability to participate in any of these programs or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations Finally changes in these programs could reduce the number of persons enrolled in or eligible for these programs or increase our administrative or healthcare costs under these programs For example maintaining current eligibility levels could cause states to reduce reimbursement or reduce benefits in order for states to afford to maintain eligibility levels If any state in which we operate were to decrease premiums paid to us or pay us less than the amount necessary to keep pace with our cost trends it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows The implementation of the ACA as well as potential repeal of changes to or judicial challenges to the ACA could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows  The enactment of the ACA in March 2010 transformed the US healthcare delivery system through a series of complex initiatives however the implementation of the ACA continues to face administrative judicial and legislative challenges to repeal or change certain of its significant provisions Changes to or repeal of portions or the entirety of the ACA as well as judicial interpretations in response to constitutional and other legal challenges as well as the uncertainty generated by such actual or potential challenges could materially and adversely affect our business and financial position results of operations or cash flows Even if the ACA is not amended or repealed under the current administration a future administration or members of Congress could continue to propose changes impacting implementation of the ACA which could materially and adversely affect our financial position or operations Among the most significant of the ACAs provisions was the establishment of the Health Insurance Marketplace for individuals and small employers to purchase health insurance coverage that included a minimum level of benefits and restrictions on coverage limitations and premium rates as well as the expansion of Medicaid coverage to all individuals under age 65 with incomes up to 138 of the federal poverty level beginning January 1 2014 subject to each states election The HHS additionally indicated that it would consider a limited number of premium assistance demonstration proposals from states that want to privatize Medicaid expansion Arkansas was the first state to obtain federal approval to use Medicaid funding to purchase private insurance for lowincome residents and we began operations under the program beginning on January 1 2014 Several states have obtained Section 1115 waivers to implement the ACAs Medicaid expansion in ways that extend beyond the flexibility provided by the federal law with additional states pursuing Section 1115 waivers regarding eligibility criteria benefits and costsharing and provider payments across their Medicaid programs Litigation challenging Section 1115 waiver activity for both new and previously approved waivers is expected to continue both through administrative actions and the courts There have been significant administrative efforts to repeal or limit implementation of certain provisions of the ACA through changes in regulations Such initiatives include repeal of the individual mandate effective in 2019 as well as easing the regulatory restrictions placed on shortterm health plans and association health plans AHPs which plans often provide fewer benefits than the traditional ACA insurance benefits 30 Table of Contents Additionally the US Department of Labor issued a final rule on June 19 2018 which expanded flexibility regarding the regulation and formation of AHPs provided by small employer groups and associations On June 13 2019 the HHS the US Department of Labor and the US Treasury issued a final rule allowing employers of all sizes that do not offer a group coverage plan to fund a new kind of health reimbursement arrangement HRA known as an individual coverage HRA ICHRA Beginning January 1 2020 employees became able to use employerfunded ICHRAs to buy individualmarket insurance including insurance purchased on the public exchanges formed under the ACA In addition to administrative efforts to expand the flexibility of other insurance plan options that are not required to meet ACA requirements there have also been efforts to address the ACAs nondeductible tax imposed on health insurers based on prior year net premiums written the health insurer fee or HIF The ACA imposed HIF was 80 billion in 2014 and 113 billion in each of 2015 and 2016 with increasing annual amounts thereafter The HIF payable in 2017 was suspended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2016 however a 143 billion payment occurred in 2018 Collection of the HIF for 2019 was also suspended but resumed in 2020 with a 155 billion payment Congress passed a spending bill in December 2019 which would repeal the health insurance tax indefinitely effective in 2021 If we are not reimbursed by the states for the cost of the HIF including the associated tax impact or if we are unable to otherwise adjust our business model to address the current assessment our results of operations financial position and cash flows may be materially adversely affected The constitutionality of the ACA itself continues to face judicial challenge In December 2018 a partial summary judgment ruling in Texas v United States of America held that the ACAs individual mandate requirement was essential to the ACA and without it the remainder of the ACA was invalid ie that it was not severable from the ACA That decision was appealed to the Fifth Circuit which ruled in December 2019 that the individual mandate was unconstitutional after Congress set the individual mandate penalty to 0 and remanded the case to the district court for additional analysis on the question of severability In March 2020 the US Supreme Court agreed to hear the case to review whether the individual mandate is constitutional and if the individual mandate is unconstitutional the severability issue In June 2020 Noel J Francisco the then Solicitor General of the United States together with multiple US Department of Justice colleagues submitted a brief to the US Supreme Court supporting the argument that the individual mandate is unconstitutional and that the remaining provisions of the ACA are not severable The US Supreme Court heard oral arguments in November 2020 and a ruling is anticipated in 2021 The ACA remains in effect until judicial review of the decision is concluded The ultimate content timing or effect of any potential future legislation or the outcome of the lawsuit cannot be predicted and may be delayed as a result of court closures and reduced court dockets as a result of the COVID19 pandemic These changes and other potential changes involving the functioning of the Health Insurance Marketplace as a result of new legislation regulation executive action or litigation could impact our business and results of operations Our business activities are highly regulated and new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or their enforcement or application could force us to change how we operate and could harm our business Our business is extensively regulated by the states in which we operate and by the federal government In addition the managed care industry has received negative publicity that has led to increased legislation regulation review of industry practices and private litigation in the commercial sector Such negative publicity may adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation in various markets In each of the jurisdictions in which we operate we are regulated by the relevant insurance health andor human services or government departments that oversee the activities of managed care organizations providing or arranging to provide services to Medicaid Medicare Health Insurance Marketplace enrollees or other beneficiaries For example our health plan subsidiaries as well as our applicable specialty companies must comply with minimum statutory capital and other financial solvency requirements such as deposit and surplus requirements The frequent enactment of changes to or interpretations of laws and regulations could among other things force us to restructure our relationships with providers within our network require us to implement additional or different programs and systems restrict revenue and enrollment growth increase our healthcare and administrative costs impose additional capital and surplus requirements and increase or change our liability to members in the event of malpractice by our contracted providers In addition changes in political party or administrations at the state or federal level in the United States or internationally may change the attitude towards healthcare programs and result in changes to the existing legislative or regulatory environment Additionally the taxes and fees paid to federal state and local governments may increase due to several factors including enactment of changes to or interpretations of tax laws and regulations audits by governmental authorities geographic expansions into higher taxing jurisdictions and the effect of expansions into international markets 31 Table of Contents Our contracts with states may require us to maintain a minimum HBR or may require us to share profits in excess of certain levels In certain circumstances our plans may be required to return premiums back to the state in the event profits exceed established levels or HBR does not meet the minimum requirement Factors that may impact the amount of premium returned to the state include transparent pharmacy pricing and rebate initiatives Other states may require us to meet certain performance and quality metrics in order to maintain our contract or receive additional or full contractual revenue The governmental healthcare programs in which we participate are subject to the satisfaction of certain regulations and performance standards Regulators require numerous steps for continued implementation of the ACA including the promulgation of a substantial number of potentially more onerous federal regulations If we fail to effectively implement or appropriately adjust our operational and strategic initiatives with respect to the implementation of healthcare reform or do not do so as effectively as our competitors our results of operations may be materially adversely affected For example under the ACA Congress authorized CMS and the states to implement managed care demonstration programs to serve dually eligible beneficiaries to improve the coordination of their care Participation in these demonstration programs is subject to CMS approval and the satisfaction of conditions to participation including meeting certain performance requirements Our inability to improve or maintain adequate quality scores and Star ratings to meet government performance requirements or to match the performance of our competitors could result in limitations to our participation in or exclusion from these or other government programs Specifically several of our Medicaid contracts require us to maintain a Medicare health plan In April 2016 CMS issued final regulations that revised existing Medicaid managed care rules by establishing a minimum MLR standard for Medicaid of 85 and strengthening provisions related to network adequacy and access to care enrollment and disenrollment protections beneficiary support information continued service during beneficiary appeals and delivery system and payment reform initiatives among others CMS subsequently issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on November 8 2018 advancing CMS efforts to streamline the Medicaid and CHIP managed care regulatory framework and to pursue a broader strategy to relieve regulatory burdens support state flexibility and local leadership and promote transparency flexibility and innovation in the delivery of care On November 13 2020 CMS finalized revisions to the Medicaid managed care regulations many of which became effective in December 2020 While not a wholesale revision of the 2016 regulations the November 2020 final rule adopts changes in areas including network adequacy beneficiary protections quality oversight and the establishment of capitation rates and payment policies Although we strive to comply with all existing regulations and to meet performance standards applicable to our business failure to meet these requirements could result in financial fines and penalties Also states or other governmental entities may not allow us to continue to participate in their government programs or we may fail to win procurements to participate in such programs either of which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows In addition as a result of the expansion of our businesses and operations conducted in foreign countries we face political economic legal compliance regulatory operational and other risks and exposures that are unique and vary by jurisdiction These foreign regulatory requirements with respect to among other items environmental tax licensing intellectual property privacy data protection investment capital management control labor relations and fraud and corruption regulations are different than those faced by our domestic businesses In addition we are subject to US laws that regulate the conduct and activities of USbased businesses operating abroad such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act FCPA Any failure to comply with laws and regulations governing our conduct outside the United States or to successfully navigate international regulatory regimes that apply to us could adversely affect our ability to market our products and services which may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations Our businesses providing pharmacy benefit management and specialty pharmacy services face regulatory and other risks and uncertainties which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows We provide pharmacy benefit management PBM and specialty pharmacy services including through our Envolve Pharmacy Solutions product These businesses are subject to federal and state laws that among other requirements govern the relationships of the business with pharmaceutical manufacturers physicians pharmacies customers and consumers We also conduct business as a mail order pharmacy and specialty pharmacy which subjects these businesses to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations In addition federal and state legislatures and regulators regularly consider new regulations for the industry that could materially and adversely affect current industry practices including the receipt or disclosure of rebates from pharmaceutical companies the development and use of formularies and the use of average wholesale prices Our PBM and specialty pharmacy businesses would be materially and adversely affected by an inability to contract on favorable terms with pharmaceutical manufacturers and other suppliers including with respect to the structuring of rebates and pricing of new specialty and generic drugs In addition our PBM and specialty pharmacy businesses could face potential claims in connection with purported errors by our mail order or specialty pharmacies including in connection with the risks inherent in 32 Table of Contents the authorization compounding packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other healthcare products Disruptions at any of our mail order or specialty pharmacies due to an event that is beyond our control could affect our ability to process and dispense prescriptions in a timely manner and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows From time to time we may become involved in costly and timeconsuming litigation and other regulatory proceedings which require significant attention from our management From time to time we are a defendant in lawsuits and regulatory actions and are subject to investigations relating to our business including without limitation medical malpractice claims claims by members alleging failure to pay for or provide healthcare claims related to nonpayment or insufficient payments for outofnetwork services claims alleging bad faith investigations regarding our submission of risk adjuster claims putative securities class actions protests and appeals related to Medicaid procurement awards employmentrelated disputes including wage and hour claims submissions to state agencies related to payments or state false claims acts and claims related to the imposition of new taxes including but not limited to claims that may have retroactive application Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings An unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial position results of operations andor cash flows and may affect our reputation In addition regardless of the outcome of any litigation or regulatory proceedings such proceedings are costly and time consuming and require significant attention from our management and could therefore harm our business and financial position results of operations or cash flows If we fail to comply with applicable privacy security and data laws regulations and standards including with respect to thirdparty service providers that utilize sensitive personal information on our behalf our business reputation results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected As part of our normal operations we collect process and retain confidential member information We are subject to various federal state and international laws regulations rules and contractual requirements regarding the use and disclosure of confidential member information including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 HIPAA the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health HITECH Act of 2009 the GrammLeachBliley Act and the European Unions General Data Protection Regulation which require us to protect the privacy of medical records and safeguard personal health information we maintain and use Certain of our businesses are also subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard which is a multifaceted security standard that is designed to protect credit card account data as mandated by payment card industry entities Despite our best attempts to maintain adherence to information privacy and security best practices as well as compliance with applicable laws rules and contractual requirements our facilities and systems and those of our thirdparty service providers may be vulnerable to privacy or security breaches acts of vandalism or theft malware or other forms of cyberattack misplaced or lost data including paper or electronic media programming andor human errors or other similar events In the past we have had data breaches resulting in disclosure of confidential or protected health information that have not resulted in any material financial loss or penalty to date For example in January 2021 we learned that Accellion a thirdparty data transfer provider with whom we contract had a system vulnerability that resulted in unauthorized access to certain sensitive data of our customers including protected health information over a period of several days in January 2021 as well as unauthorized access to the data of several of Accellions other clients This incident is still under investigation but we currently do not believe that it will have a material adverse effect on our business reputation results of operations financial position and cash flows However there can be no assurance that the January 2021 incident and other privacy or security breaches will not require us to expend significant resources to remediate any damage interrupt our operations and damage our business or reputation subject us to state federal or international agency review and result in enforcement actions material fines and penalties litigation or other actions which could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation results of operations financial position and cash flows In addition HIPAA broadened the scope of fraud waste and abuse laws applicable to healthcare companies and established enforcement mechanisms to combat fraud waste and abuse including civil and in some instances criminal penalties for failure to comply with specific standards relating to the privacy security and electronic transmission of protected health information The HITECH Act expanded the scope of these provisions by mandating individual notification in instances of breaches of protected health information providing enhanced penalties for HIPAA violations and granting enforcement authority to states Attorneys General in addition to the HHS Office for Civil Rights It is possible that Congress may enact additional legislation in the future to increase the amount or application of penalties and to create a private right of action under HIPAA which could entitle patients to seek monetary damages for violations of the privacy rules 33 Table of Contents If we fail to comply with the extensive federal and state fraud waste and abuse laws our business reputation results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected We along with other companies involved in public healthcare programs are the subject of federal and state fraud waste and abuse investigations The regulations and contractual requirements applicable to participants in these public sector programs are complex and subject to change Violations of fraud waste and abuse laws applicable to us could result in civil monetary penalties criminal fines and imprisonment andor exclusion from participation in Medicaid Medicare TRICARE and other federal healthcare programs and federally funded state health programs Fraud waste and abuse prohibitions encompass a wide range of activities including kickbacks for referral of members incorrect and unsubstantiated billing or billing for unnecessary medical services improper marketing and violations of patient privacy rights These fraud waste and abuse laws include the federal False Claims Act which prohibits the known filing of a false claim or the known use of false statements to obtain payment from the federal government and the federal antikickback statute which prohibits the payment or receipt of remuneration to induce referrals or recommendations of healthcare items or services Many states have fraud waste and abuse laws including false claim act and antikickback statutes that closely resemble the federal False Claims Act and the federal antikickback statute In addition the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 encouraged states to enact stateversions of the federal False Claims Act that establish liability to the state for false and fraudulent Medicaid claims and that provide for among other things claims to be filed by qui tam relators private parties acting on the governments behalf Federal and state governments have made investigating and prosecuting healthcare fraud waste and abuse a priority In the event we fail to comply with the extensive federal and state fraud waste and abuse laws our business reputation results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected Risks Relating to Conditions in the Financial Markets and Economy Our investment portfolio may suffer losses which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or liquidity We maintain a significant investment portfolio of cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm investments in a variety of securities which are subject to general credit liquidity market and interest rate risks and will decline in value if interest rates increase or one of the issuers credit ratings is reduced Furthermore COVID19 has impacted and may continue to impact the global economy resulting in significant market volatility and fluctuating interest rates As a result we may experience a reduction in value or loss of our investments which may have a negative adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity and financial condition Adverse credit market conditions may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity or our ability to obtain credit on acceptable terms In the past the securities and credit markets have experienced extreme volatility and disruption which has increased due to the effects of COVID19 The availability of credit from virtually all types of lenders has at times been restricted In the event we need access to additional capital to pay our operating expenses fund subsidiary surplus requirements make payments on or refinance our indebtedness pay capital expenditures or fund acquisitions our ability to obtain such capital may be limited and the cost of any such capital may be significant particularly if we are unable to access our existing credit facility Our access to additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as prevailing economic and credit market conditions the general availability of credit the overall availability of credit to our industry our credit ratings and credit capacity and perceptions of our financial prospects Similarly our access to funds may be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us If one or any combination of these factors were to occur our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient and in such case we may not be able to successfully obtain sufficient additional financing on favorable terms within an acceptable time or at all We have substantial indebtedness outstanding and may incur additional indebtedness in the future Such indebtedness could reduce our agility and may adversely affect our financial condition As of December 31 2020 we had consolidated indebtedness of 16779 million We intend to incur additional indebtedness to finance a portion of the consideration for the Magellan Acquisition and we may further increase our indebtedness in the future This may have the effect among other things of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and increasing borrowing costs Among other things our revolving credit facility and term loan facility collectively the Company Credit Facility and the indentures governing our notes require us to comply with various covenants that impose restrictions on our operations 34 Table of Contents including our ability to incur additional indebtedness create liens pay dividends make certain investments or other restricted payments sell or otherwise dispose of substantially all of our assets and engage in other activities Our Company Credit Facility also requires us to comply with a maximum debttoEBITDA ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio These restrictive covenants could limit our ability to pursue our business strategies In addition any failure by us to comply with these restrictive covenants could result in an event of default under our Credit Facility and in some circumstances under the indentures governing our notes which in any case could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition Changes in the method pursuant to which the LIBOR rates are determined and potential phasing out of LIBOR after 2021 may affect the value of the financial obligations to be held or issued by us that are linked to LIBOR or our results of operations or financial condition As of December 31 2020 borrowings under our Company Credit Facility bear interest based upon various reference rates including LIBOR On July 27 2017 the Financial Conduct Authority the authority that regulates LIBOR announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021 On November 30 2020 ICE Benchmark Administration IBA the administrator of LIBOR announced plans to consult on ceasing the publication of certain US dollar LIBOR rates on December 31 2021 and to extend the transition for other US dollar LIBOR rates to June 2023 The US Federal Reserve concurrently issued a statement advising banks to stop new US dollar LIBOR issuances by the end of 2021 In light of these recent announcements the future of LIBOR at this time is uncertain and any changes in the methods by which LIBOR is determined or regulatory activity related to the phasing out of LIBOR could cause LIBOR to perform differently than in the past or cease to exist The US Federal Reserve in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee a steering committee comprised of large US financial institutions announced replacement of US dollar LIBOR with a new index calculated by shortterm repurchase agreements backed by US Treasury securities called the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR The first publication of SOFR was released in April 2018 Whether or not SOFR attains market traction as a LIBOR replacement tool remains in question and the future of LIBOR at this time is uncertain As a result it is not possible to predict the effect of any changes establishment of alternative references rates or other reforms to LIBOR that may be enacted in the UK or elsewhere The elimination of LIBOR or any other changes or reforms to the determination or supervision of LIBOR could have an adverse impact on the market for or value of any LIBORlinked securities loans and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to us or on our overall financial condition or results of operations Risks Associated with Mergers Acquisitions and Divestitures Mergers and acquisitions may not be accretive and may cause dilution to our earning per share which may cause the market price of our common stock to decline The market price of our common stock is generally subject to volatility and there can be no assurances regarding the level or stability of our share price at any time The market price of our common stock may decline as a result of acquisitions including the Magellan Acquisition if among other things we are unable to achieve the expected cost and revenue synergies or growth in earnings the operational cost savings estimates in connection with the integration of acquired businesses with ours are not realized as rapidly or to the extent anticipated the transaction costs related to the acquisitions and integrations are greater than expected or if any financing related to the acquisitions is on unfavorable terms The market price also may decline if we do not achieve the perceived benefits of the acquisitions including the Magellan Acquisition as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts or if the effect of the acquisitions on our financial position results of operations or cash flows is not consistent with the expectations of financial or industry analysts We may be unable to successfully integrate our existing business with acquired businesses and realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions The success of acquisitions we make including the Magellan Acquisition will depend in part on our ability to successfully combine the existing business of Centene with such acquired businesses and realize the anticipated benefits including synergies cost savings growth in earnings innovation and operational efficiencies from the combinations If we are unable to achieve these objectives within the anticipated time frame or at all the anticipated benefits may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected and the value of our common stock may be harmed The integration of acquired businesses including Magellan Health with our existing business is a complex costly and timeconsuming process The integration may result in material challenges including without limitation  the diversion of managements attention from ongoing business concerns and performance shortfalls as a result of the devotion of managements attention to the integration  managing a larger company 35 Table of Contents  maintaining employee morale and retaining key management and other employees  the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding the integration process  retaining existing business and operational relationships and attracting new business and operational relationships  consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating duplicative operations  coordinating geographically separate organizations  unanticipated issues in integrating information technology communications and other systems  unanticipated changes in federal or state laws or regulations including the ACA and any regulations enacted thereunder  unforeseen expenses or delays associated with the acquisition andor integration  achieving actual cost savings at the anticipated levels and  decreases in premiums paid under government sponsored healthcare programs by any state in which we operate Many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in delays increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of managements time and energy which could materially affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows Our ability to successfully manage the expanded business following any given acquisition including the Magellan Acquisition will depend in part upon managements ability to design and implement strategic initiatives that address not only the integration of two independent standalone companies but also the increased scale and scope of the combined business with its associated increased costs and complexity There can be no assurances that we will be successful in managing our expanded operations as a result of acquisitions or that we will realize the expected growth in earnings operating efficiencies cost savings and other benefits The financing arrangements that we entered into in connection with the WellCare Acquisition may under certain circumstances contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly impact our ability to operate our business We incurred significant new indebtedness in connection with the WellCare Acquisition Certain of the agreements governing the indebtedness that we incurred in connection with the WellCare Acquisition contains covenants that among other things may under certain circumstances place limitations on the dollar amounts paid or other actions relating to  payments in respect of or redemptions or acquisitions of debt or equity issued by us or our subsidiaries including the payment of dividends on our common stock  incurring additional indebtedness  incurring guarantee obligations  paying dividends  creating liens on assets  entering into sale and leaseback transactions  making investments loans or advances  entering into hedging transactions  engaging in mergers consolidations or sales of all or substantially all of their respective assets and  engaging in certain transactions with affiliates In addition we are required to maintain a minimum amount of excess availability as set forth in these agreements Our ability to maintain minimum excess availability in future periods will depend on our ongoing financial and operating performance which in turn will be subject to economic conditions and to financial market and competitive factors many of which are beyond our control The ability to comply with this covenant in future periods will also depend on our ability to successfully implement its overall business strategy and realize the anticipated benefits of the WellCare Acquisition including synergies cost savings innovation and operational efficiencies Various risks uncertainties and events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with the covenants contained in our financing agreements Failure to comply with any of the covenants in our existing or future financing agreements could result in a default under those agreements and under other agreements containing crossdefault provisions A default would permit lenders to accelerate the maturity of the debt under these agreements and to foreclose upon any collateral securing the debt Under these circumstances we might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of its obligations In addition the limitations imposed by financing agreements on our ability to incur additional debt and to take other actions might significantly impair its ability to obtain other financing 36 Table of Contents Additional Risks Associated with the Magellan Acquisition The merger with Magellan Health is subject to conditions some or all of which may not be satisfied or completed on a timely basis if at all Failure to complete the merger with Magellan Health could have adverse effects on our business The completion of the merger is subject to a number of conditions including among others the receipt of US federal antitrust clearance and certain other required state regulatory approvals which make the completion of the Magellan Acquisition and timing thereof uncertain Also either we or Magellan Health may terminate the merger agreement Merger Agreement if the Magellan Acquisition is not consummated by October 4 2021 subject to an automatic extension to January 4 2022 in certain circumstances except that this right to terminate the Merger Agreement will not be available to any party whose failure to perform in any material respect any obligation under the Merger Agreement has been the proximate cause of the failure of the merger to be consummated on or before that date If the Magellan Acquisition is not completed our ongoing business may be adversely affected and without realizing any of the benefits that we could have realized had the Magellan Acquisition been completed we will be subject to a number of risks including the following  the market price of our common stock could decline  inability to secure financing  if the Merger Agreement is terminated and our board of directors Board seeks another business combination our stockholders cannot be certain that we will be able to find a party willing to enter into any transaction on terms equivalent to or more attractive than the terms that we and Magellan Health have agreed to in the Merger Agreement  time and resources committed by our management to matters relating to the Magellan Acquisition could otherwise have been devoted to pursuing other beneficial opportunities  we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets or from our customers or employees and  we will be required to pay our costs relating to the Magellan Acquisition such as legal accounting financial advisory and printing fees whether or not the Magellan Acquisition is completed In addition if the Magellan Acquisition is not completed we could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the Magellan Acquisition or related to any enforcement proceeding commenced against us to perform our obligations under the Merger Agreement If any such risk materializes it could adversely impact our ongoing business Similarly delays in the completion of the Magellan Acquisition could among other things result in additional transaction costs loss of revenue or other negative effects associated with uncertainty about completion of the Magellan Acquisition and cause us not to realize some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve if the Magellan Acquisition is successfully completed within its expected timeframe We cannot assure you that the conditions to the closing of the Magellan Acquisition will be satisfied or waived or that the Magellan Acquisition will be consummated Centene and Magellan Health may be targets of securities class action and derivative lawsuits that could result in substantial costs and may delay or prevent the Magellan Acquisition from being completed Securities class action lawsuits and derivative lawsuits are often brought against public companies that have entered into merger agreements Even if the lawsuits are without merit defending against these claims can result in substantial costs and divert management time and resources An adverse judgment could result in monetary damages which could have a negative impact on Centenes and Magellan Healths respective liquidity and financial condition Additionally if a plaintiff is successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting completion of the Magellan Acquisition then that injunction may delay or prevent the Magellan Acquisition from being completed or from being completed within the expected timeframe which may adversely affect Centenes business financial position and results of operation Currently Centene is not aware of any securities class action lawsuits or derivative lawsuits having been filed in connection with the Magellan Acquisition Completion of the Magellan Acquisition may trigger change in control or other provisions in certain agreements to which Magellan Health or its subsidiaries are a party which may have an adverse impact on the combined companys business and results of operations The completion of the Magellan Acquisition may trigger change in control and other provisions in certain agreements to which Magellan Health or its subsidiaries are a party If we and Magellan Health are unable to negotiate waivers of those provisions the counterparties may exercise their rights and remedies under the agreements potentially terminating the agreements or seeking monetary damages Even if we and Magellan Health are able to negotiate waivers the counterparties may require a fee 37 Table of Contents for such waivers or seek to renegotiate the agreements on terms less favorable to Magellan Health or the combined company Any of the foregoing or similar developments may have an adverse impact on the combined companys business and results of operations General Risk Factors We may be unable to attract retain or effectively manage the succession of key personnel We are highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to operate and expand our business We may be adversely impacted if we are unable to adequately plan for the succession of our executives and senior management While we have succession plans in place for members of our executive and senior management team these plans do not guarantee that the services of our executive and senior management team will continue to be available to us Our ability to replace any departed members of our executive and senior management team or other key employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in the Managed Care and Specialty Services industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to operate and successfully expand a business such as ours Competition to hire from this limited pool is intense and we may be unable to hire train retain or motivate these personnel If we are unable to attract retain and effectively manage the succession plans for key personnel executives and senior management our business and financial position results of operations or cash flows could be harmed Future issuances and sales of additional shares of preferred or common stock could reduce the market price of our shares of common stock We may from time to time issue additional securities to raise capital or in connection with acquisitions We often acquire interests in other companies by using a combination of cash and our common stock or just our common stock Further shares of preferred stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series as our Board of Directors may from time to time determine each such series to be distinctively designated The issuance of any such preferred stock could materially adversely affect the rights of holders of our common stock Any of these events may dilute your ownership interest in our company and have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock Item 1B Unresolved Staff Comments None Item 2 Properties We own our corporate office headquarters buildings and land located in St Louis Missouri which is used by each of our reportable segments We generally lease space in the states where our health plans specialty companies and claims processing facilities operate We are required by various insurance and regulatory authorities to have offices in the service areas where we provide benefits We believe our current facilities and expansion plans are adequate to meet our operational needs for the foreseeable future Item 3 Legal Proceedings A
