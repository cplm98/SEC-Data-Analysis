PART I Item 1 Business General Development of Business Summary Description of Chevron Chevron Corporation  a Delaware corporation manages its investments in subsidiaries and affiliates and provides administrative financial management and technology support to US and international subsidiaries that engage in integrated energy and chemicals operations Upstream operations consist primarily of exploring for developing producing and transporting crude oil and natural gas processing liquefaction transportation and regasification associated with liquefied natural gas transporting crude oil by major international oil export pipelines transporting storage and marketing of natural gas and a gastoliquids plant Downstream operations consist primarily of refining crude oil into petroleum products marketing of crude oil refined products and lubricants transporting crude oil and refined products by pipeline marine vessel motor equipment and rail car and manufacturing and marketing of commodity petrochemicals plastics for industrial uses and fuel and lubricant additives A list of the companys major subsidiaries is presented in Exhibit 211 on page E1 Overview of Petroleum Industry Petroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced by many factors Prices for crude oil natural gas petroleum products and petrochemicals are generally determined by supply and demand Production levels from the members of Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries OPEC Russia and the United States are the major factors in determining worldwide supply Demand for crude oil and its products and for natural gas is largely driven by the conditions of local national and global economies although weather patterns and taxation relative to other energy sources also play a significant part Laws and governmental policies particularly in the areas of taxation energy and the environment affect where and how companies invest conduct their operations and formulate their products and in some cases limit their profits directly Strong competition exists in all sectors of the petroleum and petrochemical industries in supplying the energy fuel and chemical needs of industry and individual consumers In the upstream business Chevron competes with fully integrated major global petroleum companies as well as independent and national petroleum companies for the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas leases and other properties and for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties In its downstream business Chevron competes with fully integrated major petroleum companies as well as independent refining and marketing transportation and chemicals entities and national petroleum companies in the refining manufacturing sale and marketing of fuels

environmental remediation provisions and yearend reserves Item 1A Risk Factors Chevron is a global energy company and its operating and financial results are subject to a variety of risks inherent in the global oil gas and petrochemical businesses Many of these risks are not within the companys control and could materially impact the companys results of operations and financial condition BUSINESS OPERATIONAL AND ACQUISITIONRELATED RISK FACTORS Impacts of the COVID19 pandemic have resulted in a significant decrease in demand for Chevrons products and caused a precipitous drop in commodity prices that has had and may continue to have an adverse and potentially material adverse effect on Chevrons financial and operating results As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10K the economic business and oil and gas industry impacts from the COVID19 pandemic and the disruption to capital markets have continued to be far reaching Crude oil prices the single largest variable that affects the companys results of operations fell to historic lows even briefly going negative due to a combination of a severely reduced demand for crude oil gasoline jet fuel diesel fuel and other refined products resulting from governmentmandated travel restrictions and the curtailment of economic activity resulting from the COVID19 pandemic As a result a market imbalance has existed and may continue to exist with oil supplies exceeding current and expected nearterm demand Although OPEC members and other countries have agreed to cut global oil supply the commitments and actions to date have not matched the significant decrease in global demand which has resulted in increased inventory levels in refineries pipelines and storage facilities in prior periods and which may drive increased inventory levels in future periods 18 Extended periods of low prices for crude oil are expected to have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations financial condition and liquidity Among other things the companys earnings cash flows and capital and exploratory expenditure programs may be negatively affected as would its production volumes and proved reserves As a result the value of the companys assets may also become impaired in future periods as we saw in 2020 The companys operations and workforce are being impacted by the COVID19 pandemic causing certain operations to be curtailed to various degrees At 50 percentowned Tengizchevroil in Kazakhstan COVID19 infections have led to the demobilization of a significant portion of the workforce adversely impacting the construction pace for completion of the FGPWPMP project Although infection levels in Kazakhstan improved in the third quarter 2020 allowing remobilization of the FGPWPMP construction workforce to commence a resurgence of infections prevented the final five percent of the planned workforce from returning to work in the fourth quarter 2020 slowing progress on the project The ultimate effects of COVID19 on FGPWPMP construction remain uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time In particular we are currently unable to predict whether COVID19 will have a material adverse impact on our ability to complete FGPWPMP on schedule or within the current cost estimate for the project As a result of decreased demand for its products the company made cuts to its upstream capital and exploratory expenditure program for 2020 which are expected to negatively impact future production have led to and could lead to further negative revisions of reserves and could also lead to the further impairment of assets Production curtailments such as those due to the reductions imposed by OPEC nations in Kazakhstan Nigeria and Angola and other production curtailment actions taken by operators of assets for which the company has nonoperated interests or due to market conditions have exacerbated and may continue to further exacerbate these negative impacts in future periods Within downstream the company reduced its capital spending program and is also deferring certain discretionary maintenance activities while maintaining expenditures for asset integrity and reliability The company has reduced the utilization rates of its refineries in response to reduced demand for its products particularly greatly reduced demand for jet fuel due to the COVID19 impact on travel and the aviation industry The companys suppliers are also being impacted by the COVID19 pandemic and access to materials supplies and contract labor has been strained In certain cases the company has received notices invoking force majeure provisions in supplier contracts This strain on the financial health of the companys suppliers could put further pressure on the companys financial results and may negatively impact supply assurance and supplier performance Incountry conditions including potential future waves of the COVID19 virus in countries that appear to have reduced their infection rates could impact logistics and material movement and remain a risk to business continuity In light of the significant uncertainty around the duration and extent of the impact of the COVID19 pandemic management is currently unable to develop with any level of confidence estimates and assumptions that may have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements and financial or operational performance in any given period In addition the unprecedented nature of such market conditions could cause current management estimates and assumptions to be challenged in hindsight There continues to be uncertainty and unpredictability about the impact of the COVID19 pandemic on our financial and operating results in future periods The extent to which the COVID19 pandemic adversely impacts our future financial and operating results and for what duration and magnitude depends on several factors that are continuing to evolve are difficult to predict and in many instances are beyond the companys control Such factors include the duration and scope of the pandemic including any resurgences of the pandemic and the impact on our workforce and operations the negative impact of the pandemic on the economy and economic activity including travel restrictions and prolonged low demand for our products the ability of our affiliates suppliers and partners to successfully navigate the impacts of the pandemic the actions taken by governments businesses and individuals in response to the pandemic the actions of OPEC and other countries that otherwise impact supply and demand and correspondingly commodity prices the extent and duration of recovery of economies and demand for our products after the pandemic subsides and Chevrons ability to keep its cost model in line with changing demand for our products The impact of the COVID19 pandemic is evolving and the continuation or a resurgence of the pandemic could precipitate or aggravate the other risk factors identified in this Form 10K which in turn could further materially and adversely affect our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and profitability including in ways not currently known or considered by us to present significant risks Chevron is exposed to the effects of changing commodity prices Chevron is primarily in a commodities business that has a history of price volatility The single largest variable that affects the companys results of operations is the price of crude 19 oil which can be influenced by general economic conditions industry production and inventory levels technology advancements production quotas or other actions that might be imposed by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries or other producers weatherrelated damage and disruptions due to other natural or human causes beyond our control including without limitation due to the COVID19 pandemic competing fuel prices and geopolitical risks Chevron evaluates the risk of changing commodity prices as a core part of its business planning process An investment in the company carries significant exposure to fluctuations in global crude oil prices Extended periods of low prices for crude oil can have a material adverse impact on the companys results of operations financial condition and liquidity Among other things the companys upstream earnings cash flows and capital and exploratory expenditure programs could be negatively affected as could its production and proved reserves Upstream assets may also become impaired Downstream earnings could be negatively affected because they depend upon the supply and demand for refined products and the associated margins on refined product sales A significant or sustained decline in liquidity could adversely affect the companys credit ratings potentially increase financing costs and reduce access to capital markets The company may be unable to realize anticipated cost savings expenditure reductions and asset sales that are intended to compensate for such downturns In some cases liabilities associated with divested assets may return to the company when an acquirer of those assets subsequently declares bankruptcy In addition extended periods of low commodity prices can have a material adverse impact on the results of operations financial condition and liquidity of the companys suppliers vendors partners and equity affiliates upon which the companys own results of operations and financial condition depends The scope of Chevrons business will decline if the company does not successfully develop resources The company is in an extractive business therefore if it is not successful in replacing the crude oil and natural gas it produces with good prospects for future organic opportunities or through acquisitions the companys business will decline Creating and maintaining an inventory of projects depends on many factors including obtaining and renewing rights to explore develop and produce hydrocarbons drilling success reservoir optimization ability to bring longleadtime capitalintensive projects to completion on budget and on schedule and efficient and profitable operation of mature properties The companys operations could be disrupted by natural or human causes beyond its control Chevron operates in both urban areas and remote and sometimes inhospitable regions The companys operations are therefore subject to disruption from natural or human causes beyond its control including risks from hurricanes severe storms floods heat waves other forms of severe weather wildfires ambient temperature increases sea level rise war accidents civil unrest political events fires earthquakes system failures cyber threats terrorist acts and epidemic or pandemic diseases such as the COVID19 pandemic any of which could result in suspension of operations or harm to people or the natural environment Chevrons risk management systems are designed to assess potential physical and other risks to its operations and assets and to plan for their resiliency While capital investment reviews and decisions incorporate potential ranges of physical risks such as storm severity and frequency sea level rise air and water temperature precipitation fresh water access wind speed and earthquake severity among other factors it is difficult to predict with certainty the timing frequency or severity of such events any of which could have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations or financial condition Cyberattacks targeting Chevrons process control networks or other digital infrastructure could have a material adverse impact on the companys business and results of operations There are numerous and evolving risks to Chevrons cybersecurity and privacy from cyber threat actors including criminal hackers statesponsored intrusions industrial espionage and employee malfeasance These cyber threat actors whether internal or external to Chevron are becoming more sophisticated and coordinated in their attempts to access the companys information technology IT systems and data including the IT systems of cloud providers and other third parties with whom the company conducts business Although Chevron devotes significant resources to prevent unwanted intrusions and to protect its systems and data whether such data is housed internally or by external third parties the company has experienced and will continue to experience cyber incidents of varying degrees in the conduct of its business Cyber threat actors could compromise the companys process control networks or other critical systems and infrastructure resulting in disruptions to its business operations injury to people harm to the environment or its assets disruptions in access to its financial reporting systems or loss misuse or corruption of its critical data and proprietary information including without limitation its intellectual property and business information and that of its employees customers partners and other third parties Any of the foregoing can be exacerbated by a delay or failure to detect a cyber incident or the full extent of such incident Further the company has exposure to cyber incidents and the negative impacts of such incidents related to its critical data and proprietary information housed on thirdparty IT 20 systems including the cloud Additionally authorized thirdparty IT systems or software can be compromised and used to gain access or introduce malware to Chevrons IT systems that can materially impact the companys business Regardless of the precise method or form cyber events could result in significant financial losses legal or regulatory violations reputational harm and legal liability and could ultimately have a material adverse effect on the companys business and results of operations The companys operations have inherent risks and hazards that require significant and continuous oversight Chevrons results depend on its ability to identify and mitigate the risks and hazards inherent to operating in the crude oil and natural gas industry The company seeks to minimize these operational risks by carefully designing and building its facilities and conducting its operations in a safe and reliable manner However failure to manage these risks effectively could impair our ability to operate and result in unexpected incidents including releases explosions or mechanical failures resulting in personal injury loss of life environmental damage loss of revenues legal liability andor disruption to operations Chevron has implemented and maintains a system of corporate policies processes and systems behaviors and compliance mechanisms to manage safety health environmental reliability and efficiency risks to verify compliance with applicable laws and policies and to respond to and learn from unexpected incidents In certain situations where Chevron is not the operator the company may have limited influence and control over third parties which may limit its ability to manage and control such risks The company does not insure against all potential losses which could result in significant financial exposure The company does not have commercial insurance or thirdparty indemnities to fully cover all operational risks or potential liability in the event of a significant incident or series of incidents causing catastrophic loss As a result the company is to a substantial extent selfinsured for such events The company relies on existing liquidity financial resources and borrowing capacity to meet shortterm obligations that would arise from such an event or series of events The occurrence of a significant incident or unforeseen liability for which the company is selfinsured not fully insured or for which insurance recovery is significantly delayed could have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations or financial condition The Noble acquisition may cause our financial results to differ from our expectations or the expectations of the investment community we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition and the acquisition may disrupt our current plans or operations The success of the Noble acquisition which closed in October 2020 will depend in part on Chevrons ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition including the anticipated annual runrate operating and other cost synergies and accretion to return on capital employed free cash flow and earnings per share Failure to realize anticipated synergies in the expected timeframe operational challenges the diversion of managements attention from ongoing business concerns and unforeseen expenses associated with the acquisition may have an adverse impact on our financial results One of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of a publicly traded master limited partnership Noble Midstream Partners LP which may involve a potential legal liability One of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of Noble Midstream a publicly traded master limited partnership Our control of the general partner of Noble Midstream may increase the possibility that we could be subject to claims of breach of duties owed to Noble Midstream including claims of conflict of interest Any liability resulting from such claims could have a material adverse effect on our future business financial condition results of operations and cash flows LEGAL REGULATORY AND ESGRELATED RISK FACTORS Chevrons business subjects the company to liability risks from litigation or government action The company produces transports refines and markets potentially hazardous materials and it purchases handles and disposes of other potentially hazardous materials in the course of its business Chevrons operations also produce byproducts which may be considered pollutants Often these operations are conducted through joint ventures over which the company may have limited influence and control Any of these activities could result in liability or significant delays in operations arising from private litigation or government action For example liability or delays could result from an accidental unlawful discharge or from new conclusions about the effects of the companys operations on human health or the environment In addition to the extent that societal pressures or political or other factors are involved it is possible that such liability could be imposed without regard to the companys causation of or contribution to the asserted damage or to other mitigating factors For information concerning some of the litigation in which the company is involved see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page 78 21 Political instability and significant changes in the legal and regulatory environment could harm Chevrons business The companys operations particularly exploration and production can be affected by changing economic regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which it operates As has occurred in the past actions could be taken by governments to increase public ownership of the companys partially or wholly owned businesses to force contract renegotiations or to impose additional taxes or royalties In certain locations governments have proposed or imposed restrictions on the companys operations trade currency exchange controls burdensome taxes and public disclosure requirements that might harm the companys competitiveness or relations with other governments or third parties In other countries political conditions have existed that may threaten the safety of employees and the companys continued presence in those countries and internal unrest acts of violence or strained relations between a government and the company or other governments may adversely affect the companys operations Those developments have at times significantly affected the companys operations and results and are carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of current and future activity in such countries Further Chevron is required to comply with US sanctions and other trade laws and regulations which depending upon their scope could adversely impact the companys operations in certain countries In addition litigation or changes in national state or local environmental regulations or laws including those designed to stop or impede the development or production of oil and gas such as those related to the use of hydraulic fracturing or bans on drilling or any law or regulation that impacts the demand for our products could adversely affect the companys current or anticipated future operations and profitability Legislation regulation and other government actions related to greenhouse gas GHG emissions and climate change could continue to increase Chevrons operational costs and reduce demand for Chevrons hydrocarbon and other products Chevron may be challenged by a further increase in international and domestic legislation regulation or other government actions relating to GHG emissions and climate change Like any significant changes in the regulatory environment GHG and climate changerelated legislation and regulation could have the impact of curtailing profitability in the oil and gas sector or rendering the extraction of the companys oil and gas resources economically infeasible Although the International Energy Agencys IEA World Energy Outlook scenarios anticipate oil and gas continuing to make up a significant portion of the global energy mix through 2040 and beyond if new legislation regulation or other government action contributes to a decline in the demand for the companys products this could have a material adverse effect on the company and its financial condition International agreements and national regional and state legislation and regulatory measures that aim to limit or reduce GHG emissions are currently in various stages of implementation For example the Paris Agreement went into effect in November 2016 and a number of countries are studying and may adopt additional policies to meet their Paris Agreement goals In some jurisdictions the company is already subject to currently implemented programs such as the US Renewable Fuel Standard program the European Union Emissions Trading System and the California capandtrade program and low carbon fuel standard obligations Other jurisdictions are considering adopting or are in the process of implementing laws or regulations to directly regulate GHG emissions through similar or other mechanisms such as for example via a carbon tax eg Singapore and Canada or via a capandtrade program eg Mexico and China Many governments are providing tax advantages and other incentives to promote the use of alternative energy sources or lowercarbon technologies The landscape continues to be in a state of constant reassessment and legal challenge with respect to these laws regulations and other actions making it difficult to predict with certainty the ultimate impact they will have on the company in the aggregate GHG emissionsrelated legislation regulations and government actions and the effects of operating in a potentially carbonconstrained environment may result in increased and substantial capital compliance operating and maintenance costs and could among other things reduce demand for hydrocarbons and the companys hydrocarbonbased products make the companys products more expensive adversely affect the economic feasibility of the companys resources and adversely affect the companys sales volumes revenues and margins GHG emissions eg carbon dioxide and methane that could be regulated include among others those associated with the companys exploration and production of hydrocarbons the upgrading of production from oil sands into synthetic oil power generation the conversion of crude oil and natural gas into refined hydrocarbon products the processing liquefaction and regasification of natural gas the transportation of crude oil natural gas and related products and consumers or customers use of the companys hydrocarbon products Indirect regulation of GHG emissions could include bans or restrictions on technologies that use the companys hydrocarbon products Many of these activities such as consumers and customers use of the companys products and substitute products as well as actions taken by the companys competitors in response to such legislation and regulations are beyond the companys control 22 Consideration of climate changerelated issues and the responses to those issues through international agreements and national regional or state legislation or regulations are integrated into the companys strategy and planning capital investment reviews and risk management tools and processes where applicable They are also factored into the companys longrange supply demand and energy price forecasts These forecasts reflect longrange effects from renewable fuel penetration energy efficiency standards climate changerelated policy actions and demand response to oil and natural gas prices The actual level of expenditure required to comply with new or potential climate changerelated laws and regulations and amount of additional investments in new or existing technology or facilities such as carbon dioxide injection is difficult to predict with certainty and is expected to vary depending on the actual laws and regulations enacted in a jurisdiction the companys activities in it and market conditions The ultimate effect of international agreements national regional and state legislation and regulation and government actions related to GHG emissions and climate change on the companys financial performance and the timing of these effects will depend on a number of factors Such factors include among others the sectors covered the GHG emissions reductions required the extent to which Chevron would be entitled to receive emission allowance allocations or would need to purchase compliance instruments on the open market or through auctions the price and availability of emission allowances and credits and the extent to which the company is able to recover the costs incurred through the pricing of the companys products in the competitive marketplace Further the ultimate impact of GHG emissions and climate changerelated agreements legislation regulation and government actions on the companys financial performance is highly uncertain because the company is unable to predict with certainty for a multitude of individual jurisdictions the outcome of political decisionmaking processes and the variables and tradeoffs that inevitably occur in connection with such processes Increasing attention to environmental social and governance ESG matters may impact our business Increasing attention to climate change increasing societal expectations on companies to address climate change and potential consumer and customer use of substitutes to Chevrons products may result in increased costs reduced demand for our products reduced profits increased investigations and litigation and negative impacts on our stock price and access to capital markets Increasing attention to climate change for example may result in demand shifts for our hydrocarbon products and additional governmental investigations and private litigation against the company In addition organizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance and related matters have developed ratings processes for evaluating companies on their approach to ESG matters Such ratings are used by some investors to inform their investment and voting decisions Also some stakeholders including but not limited to sovereign wealth pension and endowment funds have been promoting divestment of fossil fuel equities and urging lenders to limit funding to companies engaged in the extraction of fossil fuel reserves Unfavorable ESG ratings and investment community divestment initiatives may lead to negative investor sentiment toward Chevron and to the diversion of investment to other industries which could have a negative impact on our stock price and our access to and costs of capital GENERAL RISK FACTORS Changes in managements estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements and financial or operational performance in any given period In preparing the companys periodic reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 including its financial statements Chevrons management is required under applicable rules and regulations to make estimates and assumptions as of a specified date These estimates and assumptions are based on managements best estimates and experience as of that date and are subject to substantial risk and uncertainty Materially different results may occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known Areas requiring significant estimates and assumptions by management include impairments to property plant and equipment and investments in affiliates estimates of crude oil and natural gas recoverable reserves accruals for estimated liabilities including litigation reserves and measurement of benefit obligations for pension and other postretirement benefit plans Changes in estimates or assumptions or the information underlying the assumptions such as changes in the companys business plans general market conditions or changes in commodity prices could affect reported amounts of assets liabilities or expenses 23 Item 1B Unresolved Staff Comments None Item 2 Properties The location and character of the companys crude oil and natural gas properties and its refining marketing

Legal Proceedings Governmental Proceedings The following is a description of legal proceedings that involve governmental authorities as a party and the company reasonably believes would result in 10 million or more of monetary sanctions exclusive of interest and costs under federal state and local laws that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or primarily for the purpose of protecting the environment As previously disclosed the refinery in Pasadena Texas acquired by Chevron on May 1 2019 Pasadena Refining System Inc and PRSI Trading LLC has multiple outstanding Notices of Violation NOVs that were issued by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality related to air emissions at the refinery The Pasadena refinery is currently negotiating a resolution of the NOVs with the Texas Attorney General As previously disclosed the California Department of Conservation California Geologic Energy Management Division CalGEM previously known as the Division of Oil Gas and Geothermal Resources promulgated revised rules pursuant to the Underground Injection Control program that took effect April 1 2019 Subsequent to that date CalGEM issued NOVs and two orders to Chevron related to seeps that occurred in the Cymric Oil Field in Kern County California An October 2 2019 CalGEM order seeks a civil penalty of approximately 27 million Chevron has filed an appeal of this order Chevron is currently in discussions with CalGEM to explore a global settlement to resolve the Order and all past and present seeps in the Cymric Field which would increase the amount of penalty paid Noble Energy Mediterranean Ltd Noble Mediterranean received a notice of intent NOI from Israels Ministry of Environmental Protection MOEP in April 2020 alleging breaches of the Leviathan facilitys effluent discharge permit for discharges that occurred primarily before startup of the Leviathan facility and seeking an administrative monetary sanction of 108 million New Israeli Shekels NIS approximately 43 million NIS net to Noble Mediterraneans 3966 percent interest in the Leviathan facility pursuant to Israels Prevention of Sea Pollution from LandBased Sources Law Upon consideration of Noble Mediterraneans response to the NOI the MOEP rescinded certain violations alleged in the NOI and reduced the penalty to 38 million NIS approximately 12 million gross and 465000 net to Noble Mediterraneans 3966 percent interest which was paid on December 11 2020 In January 2021 the United States Department of Justice and the United States Environmental Protection Agency notified Noble Energy Inc Noble Midstream Partners LP and Noble Midstream Services LLC of potential penalties for alleged Clean Water Act violations at two facilities in Weld County Colorado relating to a 2014 flood event and requirements for a Spill Prevention and Countermeasures Plan and Facility Response Plan The parties are negotiating a resolution of these issues with the agencies Resolution of these alleged violations may result in the payment of a civil penalty of 1000000 or more Other Proceedings Information related to other legal proceedings is included beginning
