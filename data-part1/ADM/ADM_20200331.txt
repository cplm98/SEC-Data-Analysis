PART I ITEM 1 BUSINESS COMPANY OVERVIEW The Company is a technologybased developer and manufacturer of diversified lines of products and derives revenue from the production and sale of electronics for medical devices and other applications environmentally safe chemical products for industrial medical and cosmetic uses and research development regulatory and engineering services The Company is a corporation that was organized under the laws of the State of Delaware on November 24 1969 Our operations are conducted through ADM Tronics Unlimited Inc ADM and its subsidiary Sonotron Medical Systems Inc SMI COMPANY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ELECTRONICS FOR MEDICAL DEVICES AND OTHER APPLICATIONS We develop and manufacture electronic technologies for noninvasive electrotherapeutic and diagnostic medical devices as well as for veterinary and other applications The products are manufactured at our Northvale facility which is an FDARegistered Medical Device Manufacturing facility We develop and manufacture our own proprietary products as well as on a contract basis for other companies CONTRACT MANUFACTURING The Company derives revenues from contract manufacturing of electronic medical and other devices from nonaffiliated customers As of March 31 2020 we had approximately 670000 of backlog for electronic product orders ENVIRONMENTALLY SAFE CHEMICAL PRODUCTS FOR INDUSTRIAL USES We develop manufacture and sell chemical products to industrial users Such products consist primarily of the following  Waterbased primers and adhesives  Waterbased coatings and resins  Waterbased chemical additives and  Antistatic conductive paints coating and other products Waterbased primers and adhesives are chemical compounds used to bind different plastic films metal foils and papers Examples are the binding of polyethylene to polyester nylon vinyl aluminum polypropylene paper and cellophane Our waterbased primers and adhesives are similar in function to solventbased primers that are widely used to bind plastic films papers and foils Solventbased systems have come under criticism since they have been found to be highly pollutant dangerous to health and generally caustic in nature Based upon our experience since 1969 including information furnished to us by certain of our customers we believe that waterbased systems have no known polluting effects and pose no known health hazards There can of course be no assurance that any governmental restrictions will not be imposed on our waterbased products or that such products will be accepted as replacements for solvent based products Waterbased coatings and resins for the printing industry are used to impart properties to the printed substrate Our coatings and resins can be used to coat printed material for glossy or aesthetic appeal to make such material virtually impervious to certain types of grease and to impart other characteristics required or desired for various products and specifications Certain of our waterbased chemical additives are used to impart properties to inks and other chemical products used in the food packaging and printing industries These additives are used for their ability to improve the performance of such products Through AntiStatic Industries the assets of which were acquired in July 2009 we now develop and manufacture a fullline of antistatic products for commercial and industrial use through a division of our company that we refer to as Antistatic Industries Antistatic Industries develops and distributes proprietary conductive paints coatings and other products and accessories which can be used by electronics computer pharmaceutical and chemical companies to prevent reduce or eliminate static electricity Many industries are concerned with static electricity as it can be hazardous to personnel and damage corporate facilities computers electronic equipment and valuable parts Antistatic Industries has a wide range of products including paints hoses garments floor mats rugs strapping tapes hookandloop adhesive products and many other specialized items all with conductive properties Antistatic Industries has also pioneered low volatile organic compound conductive and antistatic paint and coating formulations that can be used as replacements for paints and coatings made from hazardous solvents Antistatic Industries seeks to continually develop new products through research and development for new and current customers to aid in their quest for maximum protection with less waste and rejects in their manufacturing processes by reducing or eliminating static electricity None of our chemical products are protected by patents although the names of some of such products have been protected by trademarks We do not believe that any such trademarks are material to our business As of March 31 2020 the dollar amount of backlog orders for our chemical products believed by us to be firm was not material MEDICAL AND COSMETIC PRODUCTS The Company has developed several medical and cosmetic topical products The Companys proprietary waterbased adhesive and related topical formulations are used for maxillofacial prosthetic medical applications and for professional makeup applications primarily for special makeup effects for film TV and theatrical productions RESEARCH DEVELOPMENT REGULATORY AND ENGINEERING SERVICES The Company provides research development regulatory and engineering services to unaffiliated customers for the design development and manufacturing of medical devices electronics and other technologies and products the Engineering Services The Engineering Services are provided by the Company to customers both on a feeforservices basis and on a project basis CUSTOMERS During the year ended March 31 2020 one customer accounted for 48 of our net revenue During the year ended March 31 2019 two customers accounted for 58 of our net revenue As of March 31 2020 three customers accounted for 83 of our accounts receivable As of March 31 2019 two customers represented 88 of our accounts receivable The loss of these major customers could have a material impact on our operations and cash flow MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION A majority of our product sales are distributed to customers directly from our headquarters in Northvale NJ Customers place purchase orders with us and products are then shipped via common carrier delivery on a FOB shipping point basis A portion of the sales are accomplished through distributors who place purchase orders with us for certain quantities of our products which are shipped by common carrier to the distributors respective warehouses These stocking distributors then ship product to the ultimate customer via common carrier from their inventory of our products Our contract manufacturing customers place orders with us for certain quantities of their products they desire to have us manufacture typically providing a deposit with each order Engineering Services are provided through written agreements with customers both on a feeforservices basis and a project basis MANUFACTURER AND SUPPLIERS MANUFACTURER ADM manufactures its electronic and chemical products and SMI and other customers electronic products at its facilities located in Northvale New Jersey ADM warranties the products it manufactures for SMI against defects in material and workmanship for a period of 90 days after the completion of manufacture After such 90day period ADM has agreed to provide repair services for the products at its customary hourly repair rate plus the cost of any parts components or items necessary to repair the products Under contract manufacturing agreements all inventions patentable or otherwise trade secrets discoveries ideas writings technology knowhow improvements or other advances or findings relating to the entities products and technologies shall be and become the exclusive proprietary and confidential information of such entity or any person to whom such entity may have assigned rights therein ADM has no rights in any such proprietary or confidential information and is prohibited from using or disclosing any of such proprietary or confidential information for its own benefit or purposes or for the benefit or purpose of any other person other than the entity without such entitys prior written consent ADM has also agreed to cooperate with each entity in securing for it any patents copyrights trademarks or the like which it may seek to obtain in connection therewith If ADM breaches any of the confidentiality agreements contained in the manufacturing agreement or if these agreements are not sufficient to protect the entitys technology or are found to be unenforceable the entitys competitors could acquire and use information that it considers to be our trade secrets and the entity may not be able to compete effectively Since ADM is the exclusive manufacturer of all of SMIs current and future products under the manufacturing agreement if the operations of ADM are interrupted or if orders or orders of other customers of the Company exceed our manufacturing capabilities we may not be able to deliver products on time and the entities may not be able to deliver their respective products to their respective customers on time Under the terms of the manufacturing agreement if ADM is unable to perform its obligations thereunder or is otherwise in breach of any provision thereof SMI has the right without penalty to engage third parties to manufacture some or all of its products In addition if SMI elects to utilize a thirdparty manufacturer to supplement the manufacturing being completed by ADM SMI has the right to require us to accept delivery of the products from these thirdparty manufacturers finalize the manufacture of the products to the extent necessary to comply with FDA regulations and ensure that the design testing control documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process have been met As a manufacturer of medical devices ADM is required to comply with quality requirements which require manufacturers including thirdparty manufacturers to follow stringent design testing control documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process In addition our manufacturing facility is required to be registered as a medical device manufacturing facility with the FDA and is subject to inspection by the FDA The Company has been registered by the FDA as a Registered Medical Device Establishment since 1988 allowing it to manufacture medical devices in accordance with procedures outlined in FDA regulations which include quality control and related activities Such registration is renewable annually and although we do not believe that the registration will fail to be renewed by the FDA there can be no assurance of such renewal SUPPLIERS We purchase the raw materials parts components and other items required to manufacture our products We rely on a limited number of suppliers for such raw materials parts components and other items Although there are many suppliers for each of these raw materials parts components and other items we are dependent on a limited number of suppliers for many of the significant raw materials and components due to our customers requirements We do not have any longterm or exclusive purchase commitments with any of our suppliers The failure to maintain existing relationships with suppliers or to establish new relationships in the future could also negatively affect our ability to obtain raw materials and components used in the products in a timely manner If we are unable to obtain ample supply of product from our existing suppliers or alternative sources of supply we may be unable to satisfy orders which could reduce our revenues and adversely affect relationships with our customers Accordingly in order to satisfy its customers needs we have maintained an inventory ranging in dollar amounts from 15 to 30 of sales of chemical products in the form of either raw materials or finished goods RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT During our fiscal years ended March 31 2020 and 2019 research and development expenses with respect to companysponsored research and development activities were 589373 and 673855 respectively During such fiscal years we did not expend any funds on customersponsored research and development activities with respect thereto other than contracted research and development from engineering services customers COMPETITION Our businesses are highly competitive and substantially all of our competitors possess greater experience financial resources operating history and marketing capabilities than us Although we do not believe that there are one or more dominant competitors in such industries there can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively compete with any or all of our competitors on the basis of price service or otherwise Competitors may be better able to withstand a change in conditions and throughout the economy as a whole In addition current and anticipated future consolidation among our competitors and customers may cause us to lose market share as well as put downward pressure on pricing Furthermore there is a trend in industry toward relocation of manufacturing facilities to lowercost regions such as Asia Such relocation may permit some of our competitors to lower their costs and improve their competitive position If we do not compete successfully our business operating margins financial condition cash flows and profitability could be adversely affected Our results of operations depend in part on our ability to expand our product offerings We are committed to remaining a competitive producer and believe that our portfolio of new or reengineered products is strong However we may not be able to develop new products reengineer existing products successfully or bring them to be competitive we may not be able to continue to attract and retain customers to which we sell our products INSURANCE The Company may be exposed to potential product liability claims by those who use our products Therefore we maintain a general liability insurance policy which includes aggregate product liability coverage of 3000000 for certain of our products We believe that our present insurance coverage is adequate for the types of products we currently market There can be no assurance however that such insurance will be sufficient to cover potential claims or that the present level of coverage will be available in the future at a reasonable cost ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS An investment in our stock involves a high degree of risk You should carefully consider the following information together with other information in this annual report before buying shares of our stock If any of the following risks or uncertainties occur our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected the trading price of our stock could decline and you may lose all or a part of the money you paid to buy our stock RISKS RELATING TO OUR OPERATIONS NEW ENVIRONMENTAL OR OTHER REGULATIONS COULD INCREASE THE COMPANYS OPERATING COSTS Like other manufacturers the Company is subject to a broad range of Federal state and local laws and requirements including those governing discharges in the air and water the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous substances and wastes the remediation of contamination associated with the release of hazardous substances work place safety and equal employment opportunities We have made expenditures to comply with such laws and requirements We believe based on information currently available to management that we are in compliance with applicable environmental and other legal requirements and that we will not require material capital expenditures to maintain compliance with such requirements in the foreseeable future Governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with such laws and regulations and violators may be subject to penalties injunctions or both Third parties may also have the right to enforce compliance with such laws and regulations As ADM develops new products those products may become subject to additional review and approval requirements governing the sale and use of its products Although our manufacturing processes do not currently result in the generation of hazardous wastes this may not always be the case and material costs or liabilities may be incurred by us in the future as a result of the manufacturing operations It is also possible that other developments such as additional or increasingly strict requirements of laws and regulations of these types or enforcement policies there under could significantly increase our costs of operations BECAUSE WE USE VARIOUS MATERIALS AND SUBSTANCES IN MANUFACTURING OUR CHEMICAL PRODUCTS OUR PRODUCTION FACILITIES ARE SUBJECT TO OPERATING HAZARDS THAT COULD CAUSE PERSONAL INJURY AND LOSS OF LIFE SEVERE DAMAGE TO OR DESTRUCTION OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION We are dependent on the continued operation of our production and distribution facility This facility is subject to hazards associated with the manufacture handling storage and transportation of chemical materials and products including natural disasters mechanical failure unscheduled downtime labor difficulties transportation interruptions and environmental hazards such as spills discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances and remediation complications These hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental contamination and other environmental damage and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition In addition due to the nature of our business operations we could become subject to scrutiny from environmental action groups FAILURE TO DEVELOP NEW CHEMICAL PRODUCTS ANDOR IMPROVE OUR EXISTING PRODUCTS WILL MAKE US LESS COMPETITIVE Our results of operations depend in part on our ability to expand our product offerings We are committed to remaining a competitive producer and believe that our portfolio of new or reengineered products is strong However we may not be able to continue to develop new products reengineer our existing products successfully or bring them to market in a timely manner While we believe that the products pricing and services we offer customers are competitive we may not be able to continue to attract and retain customers to whom we sell our products FAILURE TO MAKE CONTINUED IMPROVEMENTS IN OUR PRODUCTIVITY COULD HURT OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION In order to obtain and maintain a competitive position we believe that we must continue to make improvements in our productivity When we invest in new technologies or processes we face risks related to cost overruns and unanticipated technical difficulties Our inability to anticipate respond to or utilize changing technologies could have a material adverse effect on our business and our results of operations CHANGES IN OUR CUSTOMERS PRODUCTS COULD REDUCE THE DEMAND FOR OUR CHEMICAL PRODUCTS WHICH MAY DECREASE OUR NET SALES AND OPERATING MARGINS Our chemical products are used for a broad range of applications by our customers Changes including technological changes in our customers products or processes may make our chemical products unnecessary which would reduce the demand for those products Other customers may find alternative materials or processes that no longer require our products If the demand for our chemical products is reduced our net sales and operating margins may be reduced as well WE HAVE FEW PROPRIETARY RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO OUR CHEMICAL PRODUCTS THE LACK OF WHICH MAY MAKE IT EASIER FOR OUR COMPETITORS TO COMPETE AGAINST US None of our chemical products are protected by patents We do attempt to protect the names of some of our chemical products through trademarks and some of our other limited proprietary property through trade secret nondisclosure and confidentiality measures however such protections may not preclude competitors from developing similar technologies CUSTOMERS OUTSOURCE THE MANUFACTURING OF THEIR PRODUCTS TO US AND IF OUR OPERATIONS ARE INTERRUPTED OR IF OUR ORDERS EXCEED OUR MANUFACTURING CAPABILITIES THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO DELIVER THEIR PRODUCTS TO CUSTOMERS ON TIME We operate a single facility and have limited capacity that may be inadequate if customers place orders for unexpectedly large quantities of products or if our other customers place large orders of products In addition if our operations were halted or restricted even temporarily or we are unable to fulfill large orders our customers could experience business interruption increased costs damage to their reputations and loss of their customers Although customers have the right to utilize other manufacturers such manufacturers of their products need to be licensed with the FDA and identifying and qualifying a new manufacturer to replace us as the manufacturer of their products could take several months during which time they would likely lose customers and our revenues could be materially delayed andor reduced In addition our failure to produce such products could result in claims against us WE DEPEND ON A LIMITED NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS FOR THE COMPONENTS AND RAW MATERIALS USED IN OUR PRODUCTS AND THE PRODUCTS MANUFACTURED FOR THIRD PARTIES AND ANY INTERRUPTION IN THE AVAILABILITY OF THESE COMPONENTS AND RAW MATERIALS COULD REDUCE OUR REVENUE We rely on a limited number of suppliers for the components and raw materials used in the products that we manufacture for others Although there are many suppliers for each of the component parts and raw materials we are dependent on a single or limited number of suppliers for many of the significant components and raw materials due to our customers specifications This reliance involves a number of significant risks including  unavailability of materials and interruptions in delivery of components and raw materials from suppliers  manufacturing delays caused by such unavailability or interruptions in delivery and  fluctuations in the quality and the price of components and raw materials We do not have any longterm or exclusive purchase commitments with any of our suppliers Failure to maintain existing relationships with suppliers or to establish new relationships in the future could also negatively affect our ability to obtain components and raw materials used in these products in a timely manner If we are unable to obtain ample supply of product from existing suppliers or alternative sources of supply we may be unable to satisfy our customers orders which could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our relationships with these customers OUR ABILITY TO EXECUTE OUR BUSINESS PLAN DEPENDS ON THE SCOPE OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND NOT INFRINGING THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS THE VALIDITY ENFORCEABILITY AND COMMERCIAL VALUE OF THESE RIGHTS ARE HIGHLY UNCERTAIN Our ability to compete effectively with other companies is materially dependent upon the proprietary nature of our technologies We rely primarily on patents and trade secrets to protect our products Third parties may seek to challenge invalidate circumvent or render unenforceable any patents or proprietary rights owned by us based on among other things  subsequently discovered prior act  lack of entitlement to the priority of an earlier related application or  failure to comply with the written description best mode enablement or other applicable requirements In general the patent position of medical device companies is highly uncertain still evolving and involve complex legal scientific and factual questions We are at risk that  other patents may be granted with respect to the patent applications filed by us and  any patents issued to us may not provide commercial benefit to us or will be infringed invalidated or circumvented by others The United States Patent and Trademark Office currently has a significant backlog of patent applications and the approval or rejection of patents may take several years Prior to actual issuance the contents of United States patent applications are generally published 18 months after filing Once issued such a patent would constitute prior art from its filing date which might predate the date of a patent application on which we rely Conceivably the issuance of such a prior art patent or the discovery of prior art of which we are currently unaware could invalidate a patent of ours or prevent commercialization of a product claimed thereby Although we generally conduct a cursory review of issued patents prior to engaging in research or development activities we may be required to obtain a license from others to commercialize any of our new products under development If patents that cover our existing or new products are issued to other companies there can be no assurance that any necessary license could be obtained on favorable terms or at all There can be no assurance that we will not be required to resort to litigation to protect our patented technologies and other proprietary rights or that we will not be the subject of additional patent litigation to defend our existing and proposed products and processes against claims of patent infringement or any other intellectual property claims Such litigation could result in substantial costs diversion of managements attention and diversion of our resources We also have applied for patent protection in several foreign countries Because of the differences in patent laws and laws concerning proprietary rights between the United States and foreign countries the extent of protection provided by patents and proprietary rights granted to us by the United States may differ from the protection provided by patents and proprietary rights granted to us by foreign countries We attempt to protect our trade secrets including the processes concepts ideas and documentation associated with our technologies through the use of confidentiality agreements and noncompetition agreements with our current employees and with other parties to whom we have divulged such trade secrets If our employees or other parties breach our confidentiality agreements and noncompetition agreements or if these agreements are not sufficient to protect our technology or are found to be unenforceable our competitors could acquire and use information that we consider to be our trade secrets and we may not be able to compete effectively Most of our competitors have substantially greater financial marketing technical and manufacturing resources than we have and we may not be profitable if our competitors are also able to take advantage of our trade secrets We may decide for business reasons to retain certain knowledge that we consider proprietary as confidential and elect to protect such information as a trade secret as business confidential information or as knowhow In that event we must rely upon trade secrets knowhow confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements and continuing technological innovation to maintain our competitive position There can be no assurance that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or otherwise gain access to or disclose such information IF THE FDA OR OTHER STATE OR FOREIGN AGENCIES IMPOSE REGULATIONS THAT AFFECT OUR MEDICAL DEVICE PRODUCTS OUR DEVELOPMENT MANUFACTURING AND MARKETING COSTS WILL BE INCREASED The testing and production of medical devices are subject to regulation by the FDA as devices under the 1976 Medical Device Amendments to the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act In the United States medical devices must be  manufactured in registered and quality approved establishments by the FDA and  produced in accordance with the FDA Quality System Regulation QSR for medical devices As a result we as the manufacturer of other parties devices are required to comply with QSR requirements and if we fail to comply with these requirements these other third parties will need to find another company to manufacture its devices In addition the Companys manufacturing facility  is required to be registered as a medical device manufacturing facility with the FDA and  is subject to inspection by the FDA The FDA can impose civil and criminal enforcement actions and other penalties on us if we fail to comply with stringent FDA regulations Medical device manufacturing facilities must maintain records which are available for FDA inspectors documenting that the appropriate manufacturing procedures were followed The FDA has authority to conduct inspections of our facility Labeling and promotional activities are also subject to scrutiny by the FDA and in certain instances by the Federal Trade Commission Any failure by us to take satisfactory corrective action in response to an adverse inspection or to comply with applicable FDA regulations could result in enforcement action against us including a public warning letter a shutdown of manufacturing operations a recall of our products civil or criminal penalties or other sanctions From time to time the FDA may modify such requirements imposing additional or different requirements which may require us to alter our business methods which could result in increased expenses RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMPANY At March 31 2020 we had an accumulated deficit of approximately nearly 30 million We may incur additional operating losses as well as negative cash flows from operations in the future We are highly dependent upon certain customers to generate our revenues For the fiscal year ended March 31 2020 one customer accounted for 48 of our net revenue For the fiscal year ended March 31 2019 two customers accounted for 58 of our net revenue All customer purchases are made through purchase orders and we do not have any longterm contracts with customers The complete loss of or significant reduction in business from or a material adverse change in the financial condition of any of such customers will cause a material and adverse change in our revenues and operating results WE MAY BE EXPOSED TO POTENTIAL RISKS RELATING TO OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND OUR ABILITY TO HAVE THE OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROLS ATTESTED TO BY OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM As directed by Section 404 of the SarbanesOxley Act of 2002 Section 404 the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report of management on the companys internal control over financial reporting in their annual reports on Form 10K A report of our management is included in our Annual Report on Form 10K We can provide no assurance that we will be able to comply with all of the requirements imposed thereby In the event we identify significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that we cannot remediate in a timely manner investors and others may lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements WE MAY BE EXPOSED TO PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS FOR WHICH OUR INSURANCE MAY BE INADEQUATE Our business exposes us to potential product liability risks which are inherent in the testing manufacturing and marketing of chemical products and electronic devices Although we maintain a general liability insurance policy which includes aggregate product liability coverage of 3000000 for certain of our products there can be no assurance that such insurance will be sufficient to cover potential claims or that the present level of coverage will be available in the future at a reasonable cost While we are not aware of sideeffects resulting from the use of any of our products there may be unknown longterm effects of their use that may result in product liability claims in the future Further we cannot provide any assurance that  our insurance will provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities if a product causes harm or fails to perform as promised  adequate product liability insurance will continue to be available in the future or  our insurance can be maintained on acceptable terms The obligation to pay any product liability claim in excess of whatever insurance we are able to obtain would increase our expenses and could greatly reduce our assets See Item 1 Business  Insurance THE LOSS OF ANY OF OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICER OR KEY PERSONNEL MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS AND OUR ABILITY TO EXECUTE OUR GROWTH STRATEGY Our ability to execute our business plan depends upon the continued services of Andre DiMino our President and Chief Executive Officer as well as our key technology marketing sales and support personnel In January 2013 the Company entered into an employment agreement with Mr DiMino containing noncompete confidentiality and other provisions for the benefit of the Company However such agreement has provisions for early termination by the Company andor Mr DiMino We do not have employment or consulting agreements containing noncompete agreements with certain of our key personnel and we may not be able to retain these individuals If we lost the services of Mr DiMino or our key personnel our business may be adversely affected and our stock price may decline In addition our ability to execute our business plan is dependent on our ability to attract and retain additional highly skilled personnel OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND ENTITIES AFFILIATED WITH HIM HAVE SUBSTANTIAL CONTROL OVER US WHICH COULD DELAY OR PREVENT A CHANGE IN OUR CORPORATE CONTROL FAVORED BY OUR OTHER SHAREHOLDERS Our executive officer and director Mr DiMino together with members of the DiMino family and entities affiliated with them may be deemed to beneficially own in the aggregate approximately 38 of our outstanding common stock The interests of our current officer and director shareholder may differ from the interests of our other shareholders As a result the current officer and director would have the ability to exercise substantial control over all corporate actions requiring shareholder approval irrespective of how our other shareholders may vote including the following actions  the election of directors  adoption of stock option plans  the amendment of charter documents or  the approval of certain mergers and other significant corporate transactions including a sale of substantially all of our assets PENNY STOCK REGULATIONS MAY IMPOSE CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS ON MARKETABILITY OF OUR SECURITIES As of March 31 2020 our common stock was exempt from the definition of a Penny Stock under SEC under Rule 2403a511 because it meets one of the following tests 1 A price of over 5 per share 2 the issuer has Average Revenue of at least 6 million for the last 3 years or 3 the issuer has Net Tangible Assets in excess of 2 million if the issuer has been in continuous operations for at least 3 years or 5 million if less than 3 years Should we not meet one of the aforementioned requirements in the future our common stock would be subject to penny stock rules Penny stock rules may discourage brokerdealers from effecting transactions in our common stock or affect their ability to sell our securities As a result purchasers and current holders of our securities could find it more difficult to sell their securities Our stock is traded on the OTC Marketplace Venture Market referred to as the OTCQB Trading volume of OTCQB stocks have been historically lower and more volatile then stocks traded on an exchange or the Nasdaq Stock Market In addition we may be subject to rules of the SEC that impose additional requirements on brokerdealers when selling penny stocks to persons other than established customers and accredited investors In general an accredited investor is a person with assets in excess of 1000000 or annual income exceeding 200000 individually or 300000 together with his or her spouse The relevant SEC regulations generally define penny stocks to include any equity security not traded on an exchange or the Nasdaq Stock Market with a market price as defined in the regulations of less than 5 per share Under the penny stock regulations a brokerdealer must make a special suitability determination as to the purchaser and must have the purchasers prior written consent to the transaction Prior to any transaction in a penny stock covered by these rules a brokerdealer must deliver a disclosure schedule about the penny stock market prepared by the SEC Brokerdealers must also make disclosure concerning commissions payable to both the brokerdealer and any registered representative and provide current quotations for the securities Finally brokerdealers are required to send monthly statements disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in an account and information on the limited market in penny stocks OUR STOCK PRICE LIKE THAT OF MANY SMALL COMPANIES HAS BEEN AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE VOLATILE We expect that the market price of our common stock will fluctuate as a result of variations in our quarterly operating results and other factors beyond our control These fluctuations may be exaggerated if the trading volume of our common stock is low WE HAVE NOT PAID DIVIDENDS IN THE PAST AND DO NOT EXPECT TO PAY DIVIDENDS IN THE FUTURE AND ANY RETURN ON INVESTMENT MAY BE LIMITED TO THE VALUE OF YOUR STOCK We have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future and any return on investment may be limited to the value of your stock We plan to retain any future earnings to finance growth ITEM 1B UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS Not applicable ITEM 2 PROPERTIES We are headquartered at 224 Pegasus Avenue Northvale New Jersey We lease approximately 16000 square feet of combined office and warehouse space from an unaffiliated third party with a monthly rent of 8478 subject to certain increases The lease expires in June 2028 The Company and its subsidiary utilize portions of the leased space We believe that our existing facilities are suitable as office storage laboratory and manufacturing space and are adequate to meet our current needs We further believe that such properties are adequately covered by insurance We do not own any real property for use in our operations or otherwise ITEM 3 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS NONE ITEM 4 MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES Not applicable PART II
