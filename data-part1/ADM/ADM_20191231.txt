distributed mainly in bulk from processing plants or storage facilities directly to customers facilities The Company has developed a comprehensive transportation capability to efficiently move both commodities and processed products virtually anywhere in the world The Company owns or leases a significant portion of the trucks trailers railroad tank and hopper cars river barges towboats and oceangoing vessels used to transport the Companys products to its customers Concentration of Revenues by Product The following products accounted for 10 or more of revenues for the following periods  of Revenues Year Ended December 31 2019 2018 2017 Soybeans 16 16 17 Soybean Meal 13 14 13 Corn 12 12 10 Status of New Products The Company continues to expand the size and global reach of its business through the development of new products Acquisitions especially in the Nutrition segment expand the Companys ability to unlock the potential of nature and serve customers evolving and expanding nutritional needs through its offering of natural flavor and ingredient products The Company does not expect any individual new product to have a significant impact on the Companys revenues in 2020 Source and Availability of Raw Materials A significant majority of the Companys raw materials are agricultural commodities In addition the Company sources specific fruits vegetables and nuts for extracts to make flavors and colors In any single year the availability and price of these commodities are subject to factors such as changes in weather conditions plantings government programs and policies competition changes in global demand changes in standards of living and global production of similar and competitive crops The Companys raw materials are procured from thousands of growers grain elevators and wholesale merchants in North America South America Europe Middle East and Africa EMEA Asia and Australia pursuant primarily to shortterm less than one year agreements or on a spot basis The Company is not dependent upon any particular grower elevator or merchant as a source for its raw materials Trademarks Brands Recipes and other Intellectual Property The Company owns trademarks brands recipes and other intellectual property including patents with a net book value of 948 million as of December 31 2019 The Company does not consider any segment of its business to be dependent upon any single or group of trademarks brands recipes or other intellectual property Seasonality Working Capital Needs and Significant Customers Since the Company is widely diversified in global agribusiness markets there are no material seasonal fluctuations in overall global processing volumes and the sale and distribution of its products and services There is a degree of seasonality in the growing cycles procurement and transportation of the Companys principal raw materials oilseeds corn wheat and other grains 7 Item 1 BUSINESS Continued The prices of agricultural commodities which may fluctuate significantly and change quickly directly affect the Companys working capital requirements Because the Company has a higher portion of its operations in the northern hemisphere principally North America and Europe relative to the southern hemisphere primarily South America inventory levels typically peak after the northern hemisphere fall harvest and are generally lower during the northern hemisphere summer months Working capital requirements have historically trended with inventory levels No material part of the Companys business is dependent upon a single customer or very few customers The Company has seasonal financing arrangements with farmers in certain countries around the world Typically advances on these financing arrangements occur during the planting season and are repaid at harvest Competition The Company has significant competition in the markets in which it operates based principally on price foreign exchange rates quality global supply and alternative products some of which are made from different raw materials than those utilized by the Company Given the commoditybased nature of many of its businesses the Company on an ongoing basis focuses on managing unit costs and improving efficiency through technology improvements productivity enhancements and regular evaluation of the Companys asset portfolio Research and Development Research and development expense during the year ended December 31 2019  net of reimbursements of government grants was 154 million  The Companys laboratories and technical innovation centers around the world enhance its ability to interact with customers globally not only to provide flavors but also to support the sales of other food ingredients The acquisition of Wild Flavors in October 2014 approximately doubled the number of scientists and technicians in research and development Since that time additional laboratories have been added including food  beverages applications laboratories in Fort Collins Colorado and Bergamo Italy as well as expanded laboratories in Decatur Illinois and Shanghai China The Company expanded its human health and nutrition portfolio in February 2017 with the acquisition of a controlling interest in Biopolis SL Biopolis a leading provider of probiotics and genomic services Biopolis provides genomic sequencing capabilities for the Companys customers as well as for its internal use Biopolis also has high throughput biological functionality testing capabilities that can be used to discover new probiotics and nutraceuticals In January 2018 the Company announced a joint development agreement with Vland Biotech to develop and commercialize enzymes for animal feed In April 2018 the Company opened its new enzyme development laboratory in Davis California to advance the research and development of feed enzyme as well as enzymes for internal use In August 2018 the Company further expanded its probiotics business with the acquisition of Probiotics International Limited With the acquisition of Neovia in early 2019 ADM further expanded its RD capabilities in Animal Nutrition globally In December 2019 the Company opened a new Animal Nutrition Technology Center in Decatur Illinois to further expand its animal nutrition capabilities to support customer innovation in pet and aqua food production in North America ADM Ventures which was launched by the Company in 2016 continues to select highpotential new product development projects from within its business units The first internal venture funded project a new sweetener has been fully commercialized and is being sold in the United States by our Carbohydrate Solutions team Through the acquisition of Neovia ADM Ventures further expanded its equity investments in promising earlystage startup companies from three to six and is looking at several others in which the Company may choose to invest The Company is continuing to invest in research to develop a broad range of sustainable materials with an objective to produce key intermediate materials that serve as a platform for producing a variety of sustainable packaging products Conversion technologies include utilizing expertise in both fermentation and catalysis The Companys current portfolio includes products that are in the early development phase and those that are close to pilot plant demonstration The Companys project with DuPont to develop sustainable packaging solutions with improved barrier properties has progressed to a pilot production facility that opened in April 2018 This facility provides samples for customers as well as engineering data for a fullscale plant In 2019 the Company announced a joint venture with LG Chem Ltd to develop biobased acrylic acid using ingredients from the Companys corn processing Acrylic acid is a key element required in the manufacture of superabsorbent polymers used in a range of hygiene products including diapers 8 Item 1 BUSINESS Continued Environmental Compliance During the year ended December 31 2019  the Company spent 48 million specifically to improve equipment facilities and programs for pollution control and compliance with the requirements of various environmental agencies There have been no material effects upon the earnings and competitive position of the Company resulting from compliance with applicable laws or regulations enacted or adopted relating to the protection of the environment A number of jurisdictions where the Company has operations have implemented or are in the process of implementing carbon pricing programs or regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions including but not limited to the US Canada Mexico the EU and its member states and China The Companys operations located in countries with effective and applicable carbon pricing and regulatory programs currently meet their obligations in this regard with no significant impact on the earnings and competitive position of the Company The Companys business could be affected in the future by additional global regional national and local regulation pricing of greenhouse gas emissions or other climate change legislation regulation or agreements It is difficult at this time to estimate the likelihood of passage or predict the potential impact of any additional legislation regulations or agreements Potential consequences of new obligations could include increased energy transportation raw material and administrative costs and may require the Company to make additional investments in its facilities and equipment Number of Employees The number of fulltime employees of the Company was approximately 38100 at December 31 2019 and 31600 at December 31 2018  The net increase in the number of fulltime employees is primarily related to acquisitions net of the early retirement and reorganization initiatives Available Information The Companys website is httpwwwadmcom ADMs annual reports on Form 10K quarterly reports on Form

issuers that file information electronically with the SEC The SECs website is httpwwwsecgov Item 1A RISK FACTORS The Company faces risks in the normal course of business and through global regional and local events that could have an adverse impact on its reputation operations and financial performance Management directs a Companywide Enterprise Risk Management ERM Program with oversight from the Companys Board of Directors The Companys Audit Committee has the delegated risk management oversight responsibility and receives updates on the risk management processes and key risk factors on a quarterly basis The Company through its business unit functional and corporate teams continually updates assesses monitors and mitigates these and other business and compliance risks in accordance with the ERM Program and as monitored by the ERM Program team and Chief Risk Officer 9 Item 1A RISK FACTORS Continued The risk factors that follow are the main risks that the ERM Program focuses on to protect and enhance shareholder value through intentional risk mitigation plans based on managementdefined risk limits The availability and prices of the agricultural commodities and agricultural commodity products the Company procures transports stores processes and merchandises can be affected by climate change weather conditions disease government programs competition and various other factors beyond the Companys control and could adversely affect the Companys operating results The availability and prices of agricultural commodities are subject to wide fluctuations including impacts from factors outside the Companys control such as changes in weather climate and rising sea levels crop disease plantings government programs and policies competition and changes in global demand The Company uses a global network of procurement processing and transportation assets as well as robust communications between global commodity merchandiser teams to continually assess price and basis opportunities Managementestablished limits including a corporate wide valueatrisk metric with robust internal reporting help to manage risks in pursuit of driving performance Additionally the Company depends globally on agricultural producers to ensure an adequate supply of the agricultural commodities Reduced supply of agricultural commodities could adversely affect the Companys profitability by increasing the cost of raw materials andor limiting the Companys ability to procure transport store process and merchandise agricultural commodities in an efficient manner High and volatile commodity prices can place more pressures on shortterm working capital funding Conversely if supplies are abundant and crop production globally outpaces demand for more than one or two crop cycles price volatility is somewhat diminished This could result in reduced operating results due to the lack of supply chain dislocations and reduced market spread and basis opportunities Advances in technology such as seed and crop protection farming techniques storage and logistics and speed of information flow may reduce the significance of dislocations and arbitrage opportunities in the agricultural global markets which may reduce the earnings potential of agricultural merchandisers and processors such as the Company The Company has significant competition in the markets in which it operates The Company faces significant competition in each of its businesses and has numerous competitors who can be different depending upon each of the business segments in which it participates The Company competes for the acquisition of inputs such as agricultural commodities transportation services and other materials and supplies as well as for workforce and talent Competition impacts the Companys ability to generate and increase its gross profit as a result of the following factors Pricing of the Companys products is partly dependent upon industry processing capacity which is impacted by competitor actions to bring idled capacity online build new production capacity or execute aggressive consolidation many of the products bought and sold by the Company are global commodities or are derived from global commodities that are highly price competitive and in many cases subject to substitution significant changes in exchange rates of foreign currencies versus the US dollar particularly the currencies of major crop growing countries could also make goods and products of these countries more competitive than US products improved yields in different crop growing regions may reduce the reliance on origination territories in which the Company has a significant presence and continued merger and acquisition activities resulting in further consolidations could result in greater cost competitiveness and global scale of certain players in the industry especially when acquirers are stateowned andor backed by public funds and have profit and return objectives that may differ from publicly traded enterprises To compete effectively the Company focuses on improving efficiency in its production and distribution operations developing and maintaining appropriate market presence maintaining a high level of product safety and quality and working with customers to develop new products and tailored solutions In the case of the nutrition business while maintaining efficient and costeffective operations are important the ability to drive innovation and come up with quality nutritional solutions for human and animal needs are key factors to remain competitive in the nutrition market 10 Item 1A RISK FACTORS Continued Fluctuations in energy prices could adversely affect the Companys operating results The Companys operating costs and the selling prices of certain finished products are sensitive to changes in energy prices The Companys processing plants are powered principally by electricity natural gas and coal The Companys transportation operations are dependent upon diesel fuel and other petroleumbased products Significant increases in the cost of these items including any consequences of regulation or taxation of greenhouse gases could adversely affect the Companys production costs and operating results The Company has certain finished products such as ethanol and biodiesel which are closely related to or may be substituted for petroleum products or in the case of ethanol blended into gasoline to increase octane content Therefore the selling prices of ethanol and biodiesel can be impacted by the selling prices of gasoline diesel fuel and other octane enhancers A significant decrease in the price of gasoline diesel fuel or other octane enhancers could result in a significant decrease in the selling price of the Companys ethanol and biodiesel The Company uses derivative contracts as anticipatory hedges for both purchases of commodity inputs and sales of energybased products in order to protect itself in the near term against these price trends and to protect and maximize processing margins The Company is subject to economic downturns and regional economic volatilities which could adversely affect the Companys operating results The Company conducts its business and has substantial assets located in many countries and geographic areas While 44 percent of the Companys processing plants and 57 percent of its procurement facilities are located in the United States the Company also has significant operations in both developed areas such as Western Europe Canada and Brazil and emerging market areas One of the Companys strategies is to expand the global reach of its core model which may include expanding or developing its business in emerging market areas Both developed and emerging market areas are subject to impacts of economic downturns including decreased demand for the Companys products and reduced availability of credit or declining credit quality of the Companys suppliers customers and other counterparties In addition emerging market areas could be subject to more volatile operating conditions including but not limited to logistics limitations or delays laborrelated challenges epidemic outbreaks limitations or regulations affecting trade flows local currency concerns and other economic and political instability Political fiscal instability could generate intrusive regulations in emerging markets potentially creating unanticipated assessments of taxes fees increased risks of corruption etc Economic downturns and volatile market conditions could adversely affect the Companys operating results and ability to execute its longterm business strategies although the nature of many of the Companys products ie food and feed ingredients is less sensitive to demand reductions in any economic downcycles The Company mitigates this risk in many ways including country risk and exposure analysis government relations and tax compliance activities and robust ethics compliance training requirements The Company is subject to numerous laws regulations and mandates globally which could adversely affect the Companys operating results and forward strategy The Company does business globally connecting crops and markets in more than 190 countries and is required to comply with laws and regulations administered by the United States federal government as well as state local and nonUS governmental authorities in areas including Accounting and income taxes anticorruption antibribery global trade trade sanctions environmental product safety and handling and production of regulated substances The Company frequently faces challenges from US and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due These challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions Any failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or appropriately resolve these challenges could subject the Company to administrative civil and criminal remedies including fines penalties disgorgement injunctions and recalls of its products and damage to its reputation Resolution of some of these tax disputes could take many years and interest and penalties may be accruing in the meantime thereby significantly increasing the notional amount of the exposures The production of the Companys products uses materials which can create emissions of certain regulated substances including greenhouse gas emissions The Company has programs and policies in place eg Corporate Sustainability Program NoDeforestation Policy Environmental Policy etc to reduce its environmental footprint and to help ensure compliance with laws and regulations Implementation of these programs and policies sometimes requires acquisition of technology at a cost to the Company Failure to comply can have serious consequences including civil administrative and criminal penalties as well as a negative impact on the Companys reputation business cash flows and results of operations 11 Item 1A RISK FACTORS Continued In addition changes to regulations or implementation of additional regulations  for example the imposition of regulatory restrictions on greenhouse gases the implementation of IMO 2020 low sulfur fuel oil requirements for ships or regulatory modernization of food safety laws  may require the Company to modify existing processing facilities andor processes which could significantly increase operating costs and adversely affect operating results Government policies mandates and regulations specifically affecting the agricultural sector and related industries regulatory policies or matters that affect a variety of businesses taxation polices and political instability could adversely affect the Companys operating results Agricultural production and trade flows are subject to government policies mandates regulations and trade agreements including taxes tariffs duties subsidies incentives foreign exchange rates and import and export restrictions including policies related to genetically modified organisms traceability standards product safety and labeling renewable fuels and low carbon fuel mandates These policies can influence the planting of certain crops the location and size of crop production whether unprocessed or processed commodity products are traded the volume and types of imports and exports the availability and competitiveness of feedstocks as raw materials the viability and volume of production of certain of the Companys products and industry profitability For example changes in government policies or regulations of ethanol and biodiesel including but not limited to changes in the Renewable Fuel Standard program under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 in the United States can have an impact on the Companys operating results International trade regulations can adversely affect agricultural commodity trade flows by limiting or disrupting trade between countries or regions Regulations of financial markets and instruments including the DoddFrank Act Consumer Protection Act and the European Market Infrastructure Regulation create uncertainty and may lead to additional risks and costs and could adversely affect the Companys futures commission merchant business and its agricultural commodity risk management practices Future government policies may adversely affect the supply of demand for and prices of the Companys products adversely affect the Companys ability to deploy adequate hedging programs restrict the Companys ability to do business in its existing and target markets and adversely affect the Companys revenues and operating results The Companys operating results could be affected by political instability and by changes in monetary fiscal trade and environmental policies laws regulations and acquisition approvals creating risks including but not limited to Changes in a countrys or regions economic or political conditions eg Brexit local labor conditions and regulations and safety and environmental regulations reduced protection of intellectual property rights changes in the regulatory or legal environment restrictions on currency exchange activities currency exchange fluctuations burdensome taxes and tariffs enforceability of legal agreements and judgments adverse tax administrative agency or judicial outcomes and regulation or taxation of greenhouse gases International risks and uncertainties including changing social and economic conditions as well as terrorism political hostilities and war could limit the Companys ability to transact business in these markets There has been a recent increase in populism and nationalism in various countries around the world and the concept and benefits of free trade are being challenged The Company has benefited from the free flow of agricultural and food and feed ingredient products from the US and other sources to markets around the world Increases in tariff and restrictive trade activities around the world eg the USChina trade dispute Iran sanctions could negatively impact the Companys ability to enter certain markets or the price of products may become less competitive in those markets The Companys strategy involves expanding the volume and diversity of crops it merchandises and processes expanding the global reach of its core model and expanding its valueadded product portfolio Government policies including but not limited to antitrust and competition law trade restrictions food safety regulations sustainability requirements and traceability can impact the Companys ability to execute this strategy successfully The Company is subject to industryspecific risks which could adversely affect the Companys operating results The Company is subject to risks which include but are not limited to product safety or quality launch of new products by other industries that can replace the functionalities of the Companys production shifting consumer preferences federal state and local regulations on manufacturing or labeling socially acceptable farming practices environmental health and safety regulations and customer product liability claims The liability which could result from certain of these risks may not always be covered by or could exceed liability insurance related to product liability and food safety matters maintained by the Company The Company has a particularly strong capability and culture around occupational health and safety and food safety however risks to the Companys reputation may exist due to potential negative publicity caused by product liability food safety occupational health and safety and environmental matters 12 Item 1A RISK FACTORS Continued Certain of the Companys merchandised commodities and finished products are used as ingredients in livestock and poultry feed The Company is subject to risks associated with economic product quality feed safety or other factors which may adversely affect the livestock and poultry businesses including the outbreak of disease in livestock and poultry for example African swine fever which could adversely affect demand for the Companys products used as ingredients in feed In addition as the Company increases its investment in flavors and ingredients businesses it is exposed to increased risks related to rapidly changing consumer preferences and the impacts these changes could have on the success of certain of the Companys customers The Company is exposed to potential business disruption including but not limited to disruption of transportation services supply of noncommodity raw materials used in its processing operations and other impacts resulting from acts of terrorism or war natural disasters severe weather conditions and accidents which could adversely affect the Companys operating results The Companys operations rely on dependable and efficient transportation services the disruption of which could result in difficulties supplying materials to the Companys facilities and impair the Companys ability to deliver products to its customers in a timely manner The Company relies on access to navigable rivers and waterways in order to fulfill its transportation obligations more effectively In addition if certain nonagricultural commodity raw materials such as water or certain chemicals used in the Companys processing operations are not available the Companys business could be disrupted Any major lack of available water for use in certain of the Companys processing operations could have a material adverse impact on operating results Certain factors which may impact the availability of nonagricultural commodity raw materials are out of the Companys control including but not limited to disruptions resulting from weather high river water conditions economic conditions manufacturing delays or disruptions at suppliers shortage of materials interruption of energy supply and unavailable or poor supplier credit conditions The assets and operations of the Company could be subject to extensive property damage and business disruption from various events which include but are not limited to acts of terrorism for example purposeful adulteration of the Companys products war natural disasters severe weather conditions accidents explosions and fires The Company is continuing to enhance and deploy additional food safety and security procedures and controls to appropriately mitigate the risks of any adulteration of the Companys products in the supply chain and finished products in production and distribution networks In addition the Company conforms to management systems such as International Organization for Standardization ISO or other recognized global standards The Companys business is capitalintensive in nature and the Company relies on cash generated from its operations and external financing to fund its growth and ongoing capital needs Limitations on access to external financing could adversely affect the Companys operating results The Company requires significant capital including continuing access to credit markets to operate its current business and fund its growth strategy The Companys working capital requirements including margin requirements on open positions on futures exchanges are directly affected by the price of agricultural commodities which may fluctuate significantly and change quickly The Company also requires substantial capital to maintain and upgrade its extensive network of storage facilities processing plants refineries mills ports transportation assets and other facilities to keep pace with competitive developments technological advances regulations and changing safety standards in the industry Moreover the expansion of the Companys business and pursuit of acquisitions or other business opportunities may require significant amounts of capital Access to credit markets and pricing of the Companys capital is dependent upon maintaining sufficient credit ratings from credit rating agencies Sufficient credit ratings allow the Company to access cost competitive tier one commercial paper markets If the Company is unable to maintain sufficiently high credit ratings access to these commercial paper and other debt markets and costs of borrowings could be adversely affected If the Company is unable to generate sufficient cash flow or maintain access to adequate external financing including as a result of significant disruptions in the global credit markets it could restrict the Companys current operations and its growth opportunities The Company manages this risk with constant monitoring of creditliquidity metrics cash forecasting and routine communications with credit rating agencies on risk management practices LIBOR London Interbank Offered rate has been the subject of recent proposals for international reform and it is anticipated LIBOR will be discontinued or modified by the end of 2021 The Companys variable rate debt credit facilities certain derivative agreements and commercial agreements may use LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing interest rates While it is not possible to predict the consequences of discontinuation or modification of LIBOR at this time the Companys financing costs could be adversely or positively impacted Although the Company does not expect that a transition from LIBOR will have a material adverse impact on its financing costs the Company continues to monitor developments 13 Item 1A RISK FACTORS Continued The Companys risk management strategies may not be effective The Company has a Chief Risk Officer who oversees the ERM Program and regularly reports to the Board of Directors on the myriad of risks facing the Company and the Companys strategies for mitigating the risks The Companys business is affected by fluctuations in agricultural commodity cash prices and derivative prices transportation costs energy prices interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and equity markets The Company monitors position limits and counterparty risks and engages in other strategies and controls to manage these risks The Company regularly reports its aggregate commodity risk exposures to the Board of Directors through the ERM process The Company has an established commodity merchandising governance process that ensures proper position reporting and monitoring limits approvals and executes training on trade compliance commodity regulatory reporting controls and other policies The Companys risk monitoring efforts may not be successful at detecting a significant risk exposure If these controls and strategies are not successful in mitigating the Companys exposure to these fluctuations it could adversely affect the Companys operating results The Company has limited control over and may not realize the expected benefits of its equity investments and joint ventures The Company has 51 billion invested in or advanced to joint ventures and investments over which the Company has limited control as to the governance and management activities Net sales to unconsolidated affiliates during the year ended December 31 2019 was 49 billion  Risks related to these investments may include The financial strength of the investment partner loss of revenues and cash flows to the investment partner and related gross profit the inability to implement beneficial management strategies including risk management and compliance monitoring with respect to the investments activities and the risk that the Company may not be able to resolve disputes with the partners The Company may encounter unanticipated operating issues financial results or compliance and reputational risks related to these investments The Company mitigates this risk using controls and policies related to joint venture formation governance including board of directors representation merger and acquisition integration management and harmonization of joint venture policies with the Companys policies and controls The Companys information technology IT systems processes and sites may suffer interruptions security breaches or

alleged personal injuries employment law product liability intellectual property environmental issues alleged tax liability see Note 13 in Item 8 for information on income tax matters and class actions The Company also routinely receives inquiries from regulators and other government authorities relating to various aspects of its business and at any given time the Company has matters at various stages of resolution The outcomes of these matters are not within the Companys complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time In some actions claimants seek damages as well as other relief including injunctive relief that could require significant expenditures or result in lost revenues In accordance with applicable accounting standards the Company records a liability in its consolidated financial statements for material loss contingencies when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated If the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other the minimum amount of the range is accrued If a material loss contingency is reasonably possible but not known or probable and can be reasonably estimated the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements When determining the estimated loss or range of loss significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of a loss to be recorded Estimates of probable losses resulting from litigation and governmental proceedings involving the Company are inherently difficult to predict particularly when the matters are in early procedural stages with incomplete facts or legal discovery involve unsubstantiated or indeterminate claims for damages potentially involve penalties fines disgorgement or punitive damages or could result in a change in business practice See Note 20 in Item 8 for information on the Companys legal proceedings Item 4 MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES None 21 PART II
