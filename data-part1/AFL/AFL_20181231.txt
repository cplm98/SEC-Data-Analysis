the following performance measures  Annualized premiums in force is defined as the amount of gross premium that a policyholder must pay over a full year in order to keep coverage The growth of net premiums defined below is directly affected by the change in premiums in force and by the change in weightedaverage yendollar exchange rates  New annualized premium sales sometimes referred to as new

strategy supports management of foreign currency risk refer to the Investments subsection below Insurance Products 1 Aflac Japan Aflac US Third Sector Insurance Accident Cancer ShortTerm Disability Medical Critical Care 2 Income Support Hospital Indemnity First Sector Insurance Dental Life Vision Protection Life Term and Whole Term Whole Savings WAYS Child Endowment 1 Actively marketed as of December 31 2018 2 Includes cancer critical illness and hospital intensive care products Japan Aflac Japans insurance products are designed to help consumers pay for medical and nonmedical costs that are not reimbursed under Japans national health insurance system Changes in Japans economy and an aging population have put increasing pressure on Japans national health care system As a result more costs have been shifted to Japanese 2 Item 1 Business consumers who in turn have become increasingly interested in insurance products that help them manage those costs Aflac Japan has responded to this consumer need by enhancing existing products and developing new products The foundation of Aflac Japans product portfolio has been and continues to be its third sector products which include cancer medical and income support insurance products Aflac pioneered the cancer insurance market in Japan in 1974 and remains the number one provider of cancer insurance in Japan today Over the years Aflac Japan has customized its cancer insurance product to respond to and anticipate the needs of its consumers and the advances in medical treatments The cancer insurance plans the Company offers in Japan provide a lumpsum benefit upon initial diagnosis of internal cancer and benefits for treatment received due to internal cancer such as fixed daily benefits for hospitalization outpatient services and convalescent care surgical benefits and outpatient treatments Aflac Japan has a unique Aflacbranded cancer insurance product for Japans postal system Japan Post see the Distribution  Japan section for background information In April 2018 Aflac Japan introduced a new cancer insurance product DAYS 1 with enhanced cancer benefits In addition to providing benefits for hospitalization outpatient treatment surgery radiation therapy and anticancer drug treatment this product was designed to provide benefits to improve quality of life and to cover outofpocket expenses not directly related to medical treatment At the same time Aflac Japan introduced DAYS 1 Plus to provide existing holders with uptodate coverage As the number one provider of cancer insurance in Japan the Company believes these products further strengthen its brand and most importantly provide valuable benefits to consumers who are looking for solutions to manage cancerrelated costs Aflac Japans EVER product is a standalone wholelife medical insurance product which offers a basic level of hospitalization coverage with an affordable premium The current version of this product includes riders to be associated with three critical illnesses cancer heart attack and stroke to better respond to consumers needs for coverage of serious illnesses These riders provide policyholders with a benefit upon the diagnosis for those three critical illnesses waiver of premium payment thereafter and unlimited hospital days for such critical illnesses Since its initial introduction Aflac Japan has expanded its suite of EVER product offerings to appeal to specific types of Japanese consumers and achieve greater market penetration In 2017 Aflac Japan revised the EVER product by introducing riders for lumpsum hospitalization benefits and surgeries for femalespecific diseases as well as strengthening outpatient benefits and reducing premiums centered on the young to middleaged market segments This product also offers a shortpay premium period to policyholders Gentle EVER Aflac Japans nonstandard medical insurance product was designed to meet the needs of certain consumers who cannot qualify for the base EVER plan In October 2018 Aflac Japan launched a new type of medical product referred to as Health Promotion Medical Insurance where a policyholder is entitled to a partial refund of the premium if the policyholders health age measured by certain health check items is lower than his or her actual age This product is marketed exclusively online and targeted at younger generations The Company believes that the affordable cancer and medical insurance products Aflac Japan provides will continue to be an important part of its product portfolio Nevertheless as the Company continues its long history of product innovation Aflac Japans product portfolio has expanded beyond traditional healthrelated products Aflac Japans Income Support Insurance provides fixedbenefit amounts in the event that a policyholder is unable to work due to significant illness or injury and was developed to supplement the disability coverage within Japans social security system This product targets young to middleaged consumers and by focusing efforts on this demographic Aflac Japan believes it is building relationships that lay the groundwork for the sale of its cancer and medical insurance later in life to the Income Support policyholders Beginning in 2013 Aflac Japan began to curtail sales of first sector savingstype products such as WAYS child endowment and fixed annuities due to persistent low interest rates in Japan and in particular the relatively large capital commitment required by such products and their lower profitability in such an environment Aflac Japan continues to sell first sector protectiontype products which include term and whole life to provide Aflac Japans traditional sales channels with a more comprehensive product portfolio to continue to crosssell with third sector products In July 2018 Aflac Japan introduced a first sector protection whole life product with low cash surrender value which offers nonsmoking policyholders further discounted premiums For additional information on Aflac Japans products and composition of sales see the Aflac Japan Segment subsection of MDA in this report 3 Item 1 Business US The Company designs its US insurance products to provide supplemental coverage for people who already have major medical or primary insurance coverage Most of Aflacs US policies are individually underwritten and marketed through independent agents Additionally Aflac US started to market and administer group insurance products in 2009 Aflac US insurance policies pay benefits regardless of other insurance Most of the Aflac US insurance benefits are paid in cash directly to policyholders therefore customers have the opportunity to use this cash to help with expenses of their choosing Aflac US offers accident coverage on both an individual and group basis These policies pay cash benefits in the event of a covered injury The accident portion of the policy includes lumpsum benefits for accidental death dismemberment and specific injuries as well as fixed benefits for hospital confinement Additional benefits are also available for home modifications wellness and increased benefits for injuries related to participations in an organized sporting activity Aflac US offers shortterm disability benefits on both an individual and group basis The individual shortterm disability product has an Aflac Value Rider that pays a benefit less claims for every consecutive fiveyear term that the policy is in force Aflac US offers coverage for critical care on both an individual and group basis These policies are designed to pay cash benefits in the event of critical illnesses such as heart attack stroke or cancer On an individually underwritten basis Aflac US offers cancer plans critical illness plans and critical care and recovery plans formerly called specified health event On a group basis Aflac US offers critical illness plans Aflac US offers hospital indemnity coverage on both an individual and group basis Hospital indemnity products provide policyholders fixed dollar benefits triggered by hospitalization due to accident or sickness or just sickness alone Indemnity benefits for inpatient and outpatient surgeries as well as various other diagnostic events are also available Aflac US also offers a lump sum rider that can be added to its individual accident shortterm disability and hospital indemnity products This rider where available provides a lump sum payment for a range of critical illness events including traumatic brain injury Type 1 diabetes advanced Alzheimers disease and many more In January 2016 a new group hospital indemnity plan was introduced that includes 11 new benefits including telemedicine and health screening This plan provides flexibility allowing the Companys clients to personalize their plan designs to complement the underlying medical coverage that is offered to employees Aflac US offers additional coverages to those listed above including dental vision and life policies Aflac US offers fixedbenefit dental coverage on both an individual and group basis Aflac US offers Vision Now SM  an individually issued policy which provides benefits for serious eye health conditions and loss of sight as well as coverage for corrective eye materials and exam benefits Aflac US also offers term and wholelife policies on both an individual and group basis For additional information on Aflacs US products and composition of sales see the Aflac US Segment subsection of MDA in this report Distribution Channels Aflac Japan Aflac US Individual Independent Corporate Agencies Independent Associates Affiliated Corporate Agencies Brokers Banks Japan The traditional channels through which Aflac Japan has sold its products consist of individual agentsagencies independent corporate agencies and affiliated corporate agencies The individual agencies and independent corporate agencies that sell Aflac Japans products give better access to workers at a vast number of small businesses in Japan Agents activities are primarily focused on insurance sales with customer service support provided by the Aflac Contact Center Affiliated corporate agencies are initially formed when companies establish subsidiary businesses to sell Aflac Japans insurance products to employees as part of a benefit package and in some cases expand to sell Aflac Japan products to other parties such as suppliers and customersThese agencies help Aflac Japan reach employees at large 4 Item 1 Business worksites and some of them are also successful in approaching customers outside their business groups The Company believes that new agencies will continue to be attracted to Aflac Japans competitive commissions attractive products superior customer service and strong brand image The Company has sold products to employees of banks since its entry into Japan in 1974 However December 2007 marked the first time it was permissible for banks to sell Aflac Japans type of insurance products to their customers By the end of 2018  Aflac Japan had agreements with approximately 90 of the total number of banks in Japan to sell its products The Company believes Aflac Japan has more banks selling its supplemental health insurance products than any of its competitors Japanese consumers rely on banks to provide traditional bank services and also to provide insurance solutions and other services The Company believes Aflac Japans longstanding and strong relationships within the Japanese banking sector along with its strategic preparations have proven to be an advantage particularly starting when this channel opened up for its products Aflac Japans partnerships throughout the banking sector provide Aflac Japan with a wider demographic of potential customers than it would otherwise have been able to reach and it also allows banks to expand their product and service offerings to consumers In 2005 legislation aimed at privatizing Japans postal system Japan Post was enacted into law The privatization laws split Japan Post into four operating entities that began operating in October 2007 In 2007 one of these entities selected Aflac Japan as its provider of cancer insurance to be sold through its post offices and in 2008 Aflac Japan began selling cancer insurance through these post offices Japan Post has historically been a popular place for consumers to purchase insurance products Legislation to reform the postal system passed Japans legislature the Diet in April 2012 and resulted in the merger of two of the postal operating entities the one that delivers the mail and the one that runs the post offices in October 2012 In July 2013 Aflac Japan entered into a new agreement with Japan Post Holdings to further expand the partnership that was established in 2008 In June 2014 Japan Post Insurance Kampo received approval from Japans primary insurance regulator the Financial Services Agency FSA to enter into an agency contract with Aflac Japan Under this contract Aflac Japan currently distributes its cancer insurance products through 76 of Kampos directly managed sales offices Aflac Japan has developed a unique Aflacbranded cancer insurance product for Japan Post and Kampo that was introduced in October 2014 In 2015 Japan Post expanded the number of post offices that offer Aflacs cancer insurance products to more than 20000 postal outlets The Company believes this alliance with Japan Post which is included in Aflac Japans affiliated corporate agencies distribution channel has benefited and will continue to benefit Aflac Japans cancer insurance sales For example sales of cancer insurance policies by Japan Post constituted approximately 25 of Aflac Japans third sector sales during the 2018 calendar year In December 2018 the Company announced that in a further strengthening of this alliance Japan Post Holdings Co Ltd a Japanese corporation Japan Post Holdings plans to purchase approximately 7 of the Parent Companys outstanding common shares through a trust using open market and private block purchases Like all common shares in the Parent Company the shares purchased by the trust will be eligible for 10for1 voting rights after being held for 48 consecutive months In connection with this announcement on December 19 2018 the Parent Company and Aflac Japan entered into a Basic Agreement regarding the Strategic Alliance Based on Capital Relationship with Japan Post Holdings Basic Agreement and the Parent Company entered into a letter agreement with Japan Post Holdings Letter Agreement Under the Letter Agreement Japan Post Holdings agreed i to establish and fund a voting trust in accordance with a trust agreement Trust Agreement by no later than February 28 2019 ii upon establishment of the trust to instruct the trustee and the sole shareholder of the trust to enter into and to itself enter into a shareholders agreement with the Parent Company Shareholders Agreement providing for among other things a cap on share ownership a minimum holding period and a standstill provision and voting restrictions that effectively limit the trustees voting rights to no more than 20 of the voting rights of the Parent Company and further restrict the trustees voting rights with respect to certain change in control transactions The terms of the investment do not provide Japan Post Holdings with a right to a board seat on the Parent Companys board of directors or with any other rights to control manage or intervene in the management of the Parent Company This strategic investment is subject to certain regulatory approvals in Japan and the US The Company anticipates that regulatory approvals will be received in the second half of 2019 The foregoing summary is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Basic Agreement and Letter Agreement including the forms of Trust Agreement and Shareholders Agreement attached to the Letter Agreement copies of which are included as Exhibits 1047 and 1048 attached hereto and the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference For additional information on Aflac Japans distribution see the Aflac Japan Segment subsection of MDA in this report 5 Item 1 Business US As of December 31 2018  the US sales force was composed of sales associates and brokers who are licensed to sell accident and health insurance Many are also licensed to sell life insurance Aflac US utilizes dualchannel distribution to market its insurance products to businesses of all sizes The career agent channel focuses on marketing Aflac to the small business market which consists of employers with less than 100 employees As such Aflac US has aligned its recruiting training compensation marketing and incentives for its career agents to encourage specific activity and sales of individual policies in this market The broker channel focuses on selling to the mid and largecase market which is comprised of employers with more than 100 employees and typically an average size of 1000 employees or more Since regional and national brokers have traditionally served the mid and largecase market the sales professionals in the broker channel are assigned a geographic market to strengthen relationships with the top brokers and sell Aflac products to their clients As a result Aflac US is represented on 160 benefit administration platforms sometimes referred to as exchanges of various brokers Sales associates and brokers are independent contractors and are paid commissions based on firstyear and renewal premiums from their sales of insurance products In addition to receiving commissions on personal production district and regional sales coordinators may also receive override commissions and incentive bonuses Aflac US has continued to evolve its career and broker management infrastructure to drive growth in sales In 2017 Aflac hired a Chief Distribution Officer to align the strategies of career and broker channels and to further expand US distribution All Aflac US sales channels are now within the organizational structure of the Chief Distribution Officer Prior to this change the broker and career channels were part of separate organizational structures Aflac US believes the addition of this role will enhance performance management and augment its longterm sales strategy Aflac US concentrates on marketing its insurance products at the worksite This method offers policies to individuals through employment trade and other associations Historically Aflac US policies have been individually underwritten however over the past several years guaranteed issue options have become available Premiums are generally paid by the employee Additionally Aflacs individual policies are portable meaning that individuals may retain their full insurance coverage upon separation from employment or such affiliation generally at the same premium Individual policies are typically guaranteedrenewable for the lifetime of the policyholder to age 75 for shortterm disability policies Aflac US collects a major portion of premiums on such sales through payroll deduction or other forms of centralized billing With Aflac US brokerage sales expansion and CAIC branded as Aflac Group Insurance Aflac US offers group voluntary insurance products desired by many large employers These products are sold on a group basis and often have some element of guaranteed issue Worksite marketing enables sales associates and brokers to reach a greater number of prospective policyholders and lowers distribution costs compared with individually marketed business For additional information on Aflacs US distribution see the Aflac US Segment subsection of MDA in this report Competition Japan In 1974 Aflac was granted an operating license to sell life insurance in Japan making Aflac the second nonJapanese life insurance company to gain direct access to the Japanese insurance market Through 1981 Aflac Japan faced limited competition for cancer insurance policy sales However Japan has experienced two periods of deregulation since Aflac Japan entered the market The first came in the early 1980s when nine midsized insurers including domestic and foreign companies were allowed to sell cancer insurance products for the first time The second period began in 2001 when all life and nonlife insurers were allowed to sell standalone cancer and medical insurance products as well as other standalone health insurance products As a result the number of insurance companies offering standalone cancer and medical insurance has more than doubled since the market was deregulated in 2001 However based on Aflac Japans growth of annualized premiums in force and diversified distribution network the Company does not believe that Aflac Japans marketleading position has been significantly impacted by increased competition Furthermore the Company believes the continued development and maintenance of operating efficiencies will allow Aflac Japan to offer affordable products that appeal to consumers Aflac Japan is the largest life insurer in Japan in terms of cancer and medical policies in force As of December 31 2018  Aflac Japan exceeded 24 million individual policies in force in Japan Aflac Japan has experienced substantial success selling cancer policies in Japan with more than 15 million cancer policies in force as of December 31 2018  Aflac Japan continued to be the number one seller of cancer insurance policies in Japan throughout 2018  The Company believes Aflac Japan will remain a leading provider of cancer insurance 6 Item 1 Business coverage in Japan principally due to its experience in the market wellknown brand lowcost operations expansive marketing system and product expertise Further the Company believes that its alliance with Japan Post will continue to benefit Aflac Japans sales of cancer insurance in Japan See DistributionJapan above for more information on Aflac Japans marketing system and its alliance with Japan Post Aflac Japan has also experienced substantial success selling medical insurance in Japan While other companies have recognized the opportunities that Aflac Japan has seen in the medical insurance market and are frequently offering new products Aflac Japan endeavors to keep its products attractive to consumers by revising benefits of medical insurance products more frequently than cancer insurance US Aflac US competes against several voluntary supplemental insurance carriers on a national and regional basis Aflac US believes its policies premium rates platforms valueadded services and sales commissions are competitive by product type Moreover Aflac US believes that its products are distinct from competitive offerings given its product focus including features benefits and its claims service model distribution capabilities and brand awareness For many companies with which Aflac US competes voluntary supplemental insurance products are sold as a secondary business A growing number of major medical and life insurance carriers are also entering into the voluntary supplemental insurance market For Aflac US supplemental insurance products are its primary business and are sold via a distribution network of independent sales associates and brokers see US Distribution above In addition the Company believes that advertising campaigns for Aflac US have increased name awareness and understanding among consumers and businesses of the value its products provide Both private and publiclytraded insurers offer major medical insurance for hospitalization and medical expenses Much of this insurance is sold on a group basis to accounts that are both fully and selfinsured The federal and state governments also pay substantial costs of medical treatment through various programs Major medical insurance generally covers a substantial portion of the medical expenses incurred by an insured Aflac policies are designed to provide coverage that supplements major medical insurance by paying cash directly to the policyholder to use for expenses their major medical insurance is not designed to cover or for any other uses that the policyholder chooses Thus Aflac US does not compete directly with major medical insurers except those who sell supplemental insurance products as a secondary business Any reduction of coverage increase in employee participation costs or increased deductibles and copayments by major medical commercial or government insurance carriers could favorably affect Aflac US business opportunities Since the implementation of the Affordable Care Act ACA beginning in 2010 some employers have shifted a larger burden of the cost of care to their employees primarily through increases in premiums copays andor deductibles such as through the use of highdeductible health plans In addition the Company believes that some employers have made increasing use of supplemental insurance product offerings in order to improve their competitiveness in employee recruitment and retention Since Aflac products provide an additional level of financial protection for policyholders the Company believes the increased financial exposure some employees may face creates a favorable opportunity for Aflac US products However given the profitability erosion some major medical carriers are facing in their core lines of business the Company has seen a more competitive landscape as they seek entry into Aflacs supplemental product segments and leverage their core benefit offerings by bundling and discounting products in order to gain voluntary market share One Day Pay SM is a claims initiative that Aflac US introduced in 2015 to process approve and pay eligible claims in just one day The Company believes that along with its brand and relevant products this claims practice has helped Aflac stand out from competitors Investments Effective January 1 2018 investments of Aflac US as well as certain subadvised assets of Aflac Japan are managed by the Companys US asset management subsidiary Aflac Asset Management LLC AAM and investments of Aflac Japan are managed pursuant to an investment advisory agreement between Aflac Japan and the Companys asset management subsidiary in Japan Aflac Asset Management Japan Ltd AAMJ AAMJ is licensed as a discretionary asset manager under the Japan Financial Instruments and Exchange Act and is subject to rules of the Japan Investment Advisors Association a selfregulatory organization with mandatory membership for Japan investment managers Beginning with the first quarter of 2018 AAM and AAMJ are reported in the Corporate and other segment category however the assets that they manage will be reported in the respective Aflac Japan and Aflac US business segments 7 Item 1 Business Japan The Companys investment strategy with respect to Aflac Japan utilizes disciplined asset and liability management while seeking diversification longterm riskadjusted investment returns and the delivery of stable income within regulatory and capital objectives as well as preserving shareholder value in the Aflac Japan business In attempting to optimally balance these objectives the Company seeks to maintain on behalf of Aflac Japan a diversified portfolio of yendenominated investment assets US dollardenominated investment portfolio hedged back to yen and a portfolio of unhedged US dollardenominated assets Each of these portfolios presents unique benefits and risks to the Company Yendenominated investments included in Aflac Japans portfolio primarily consist of Japan Government Bonds JGB other public bonds and private placement fixed income instruments The Company attempts to match both the duration and currency of these assets with Aflac Japans liabilities This poses a difficulty in Aflac Japan due to the lack of suitable longdated yendenominated fixed income instruments In 2012 the Company initiated a strategic approach to include US dollardenominated investments in Aflac Japans portfolio with the initial intent that they would be coupled with foreign exchange hedges Today this hedged US dollardenominated investment portfolio is mainly invested in longterm fixed and floatingrate loans and longterm investmentgrade fixed income securities The primary goals of the yendenominated and hedged US dollar portfolios are to provide sufficient yen cash flows to support the insurance liabilities and other yendenominated obligations of Aflac Japan and to seek appropriate longterm riskadjusted investment returns supportive of solvency margin ratio SMR levels that provide sufficient dividend flows to the Parent Company  The hedges supporting this portion of the US dollar portfolio pose derivative rollover risk that could amplify hedge costs in unfavorable market conditions risk of counterparty default and may require the Company to post collateral In a declining yen environment these hedges could result in negative cash settlements that may significantly increase liquidity requirements thereby shifting funds away from other capital management opportunities including loss of investment income If the combined yendenominated and hedged US dollardenominated portfolios are larger than Aflac Japans yen obligations the economic value of these portfolios may be eroded under a longterm scenario of weakening yen due to foreign currency translation risk one result of which may be to reduce the Companys dividend capacity The Company also maintains an unhedged US dollardenominated investment portfolio with the objectives of generating enhanced investment returns and mitigating certain of the risks posed by the yen and hedged US dollardenominated portfolios as outlined above Further the Company has determined that the unhedged portfolio acts as a natural economic currency hedge of a portion of the Companys investment in Aflac Japan against erosion of economic value However the unhedged US dollardenominated investment portfolio creates an unmatched foreign currency exposure and subjects Aflac Japan to volatility in regulatory capital and earnings which may adversely impact Aflac Japans ability to pay dividends to the Parent Company The Companys approach to sizing the unhedged US dollardenominated investment portfolio seeks to balance the unique risks presented by each of the three portfolios outlined above but the overall investment strategy in Aflac Japan is guided primarily by the objective of securing the longterm financial strength of Aflac Japan and funding of yen liabilities As a result the Company has historically maintained and currently maintains the size of the unhedged portfolio at levels below the stressed economic surplus in Aflac Japan The determination of stressed economic surplus in Aflac Japan involves multiple models using multiple statistical approaches and assuming various economic and operating scenarios that are stressed to arrive at a range of potential outcomes This range does not account for all economic scenarios some of which may result in values outside of the range The Company periodically assesses the stressed economic surplus in Aflac Japan which fluctuates over time and adjusts the size of the unhedged portfolio accordingly The portfolio may include mediumterm and longterm fixedrate government and corporate investmentgrade and highyield bonds floatingrate loans public equities and alternative asset classes In determining the composition of the portfolio the Company also considers diversification hedge cost investment returns relative to yendenominated investment yields and Aflac Japan capital requirements At December 31 2018 this unhedged US dollardenominated portfolio was approximately 144 billion  compared with approximately 130 billion at December 31 2017 For additional discussion of business and market risks associated with the Companys investment strategy in Japan refer to the Risk Factors and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk sections US The Companys investment strategy with respect to Aflac US utilizes disciplined asset and liability management while seeking longterm riskadjusted investment returns and the delivery of stable income within regulatory and capital objectives As part of the Companys portfolio management and asset allocation process Aflac US invests in fixedmaturity investments and growth assets including public equities and alternative investments in limited partnerships

that the acquisition or change of control of a domestic insurer or of any person that controls a domestic insurer cannot be consummated without the prior approval of the Nebraska Department of Insurance A person seeking to acquire control directly or indirectly of a domestic insurance company or of any person controlling a domestic insurance company in the case of Aflac the Parent Company must generally file with the Nebraska Department of Insurance NDOI an application for change of control containing certain information required by statute and published regulations and provide a copy to Aflac In Nebraska control is generally presumed to exist if any person directly or indirectly acquires 10 or more of an insurance company or of any other person or entity controlling the insurance company The 10 presumption is not conclusive and control may be found to exist at less than 10 Similar laws apply in New York the domiciliary jurisdiction of Aflacs New York insurance subsidiary State insurance departments conduct periodic examinations of the books and records financial reporting policy filings and market conduct of insurance companies domiciled in their states generally once every three to five years Examinations are generally carried out in cooperation with the insurance departments of other states under guidelines promulgated by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners NAIC In 2016 fullscope riskfocused financial examinations were conducted by the NDOI New York Department of Financial Services NYDFS and the South Carolina Department of Insurance SCDOI on their state domiciled insurance entities American Family Life Assurance Company of Columbus American Family Life Assurance Company of New York and Continental American Insurance Company respectively The NDOI and NYDFS exams covered a fouryear period ending December 31 2015 whereas the SCDOI exam covered a fiveyear period ending December 31 2015 There were no material findings contained in the NDOI NYDFS and SCDOI final exam reports The NAIC continually reviews regulatory matters  such as riskbased capital RBC modernization group capital calculations liquidity risk assessment and principlebased reserving The NAIC has adopted a valuation manual containing a principlebased approach to calculation of life insurance reserves The valuation manual became effective January 1 2017 There is a threeyear transition period beginning January 1 2017 during which companies can choose on a product by product basis to implement principlebased reserving for new business The Company anticipates that the adoption of this manual will not cause a material impact on the statutory reserves of Aflac Aflac New York or CAIC The NAIC uses an RBC formula relating to insurance risk business risk asset risk and interest rate risk to facilitate identification by insurance regulators of inadequately capitalized insurance companies based upon the types and mix of risk inherent in the insurers operations The formulas for determining the amount of RBC specify various weighting factors that are applied to financial balances or various levels of activity based on the perceived degree of risk Regulatory compliance is determined by a ratio of a companys regulatory total adjusted capital to its authorized control level RBC as defined by the NAIC Companies below specific trigger points or ratios are classified within certain levels each of which requires specified corrective action The levels are company action regulatory action authorized control and mandatory control As of December 31 2018  based on yearend statutory accounting results Aflacs company action level RBC ratio was 560  The 2018 RBC as filed is lower than Aflac US standalone RBC due to the inclusion of Aflac Japan for the first quarter of 2018 The RBC charge reflects the business risk without any total adjusted capital TAC Aflacs NAIC RBC ratio remains high and reflects a very strong capital and surplus position 10 Item 1 Business Under state insurance guaranty association laws and similar laws in international jurisdictions the Company is subject to assessments based on the share of business the Company writes in the relevant jurisdiction for certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders and claimants In the United States some states permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax offsets The Companys policy is to accrue assessments when the entity for which the insolvency relates has met its state of domiciles statutory definition of insolvency the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable and the related premium upon which the assessment is based is written In most states the definition is met with a declaration of financial insolvency by a court of competent jurisdiction For additional information regarding state insurance guaranty assessments see the US Regulatory Environment subsection of MDA in this report Healthcare Reform Legislation Federal legislation and administrative policies in several areas including health care reform legislation financial services reform legislation securities regulation pension regulation privacy tort reform legislation and taxation can significantly and adversely affect insurance companies For example the ACA federal health care reform legislation gave the US federal government direct regulatory authority over the business of health insurance The reform included major changes to the US health care insurance marketplace Among other changes the reform legislation included an individual medical insurance coverage mandate which has since been repealed effective 2019 by the Tax Act discussed below provided for penalties on certain employers for failing to provide adequate coverage created health insurance exchanges and addressed coverage and exclusions as well as medical loss ratios It also imposed an excise tax on certain high cost plans known as the Cadillac tax that is currently scheduled to begin in 2022 The legislation also included changes in government reimbursements and tax credits for individuals and employers and altered federal and state regulation of health insurers The ACA as enacted does not require material changes in the design of the Companys insurance products However indirect consequences of the legislation and regulations could present challenges that could potentially have an impact on the Companys sales model financial condition and results of operations The United States Congress has considered and may continue to consider legislation that would repeal and replace key provisions of the ACA There can be no assurance that any legislation affecting the ACA will be passed by Congress nor as to the ultimate timing or provisions of any such legislation nor as to the effect of any such legislation on the design or marketability of the Companys insurance products Further certain provisions of the ACA have been and may continue to be subject to challenge through litigation the ultimate effects of which on the ACA are uncertain Tax Reform Legislation A budget reconciliation act commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Job Act Tax Act was signed into law on December 22 2017 Among other things effective January 1 2018 the Tax Act reduced the US federal statutory corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 eliminated or reduced certain deductions and credits and limited the deductibility of interest expense and executive compensation The Tax Act also transitions international corporate taxation from a worldwide system to a modified territorial system which in light of the current tax treatment of Aflac Japan has the effect of subjecting the earnings of Aflac Japan to Japan taxation and subjecting the Companys other earnings including the consolidated earnings of the Parent Company to US taxation These changes were effective on January 1 2018 Because changes to tax rates are accounted for in the period of enactment during the period ended December 31 2017 the Company revalued its deferred tax assets and liabilities and recorded as the Companys reasonable estimate a net deferred tax liability reduction of 19 billion as of that date As of the fourth quarter of 2018 the Company recorded an immaterial adjustment to the provisional amount of deferred tax liabilities DTLs related to the Japan tax computation and no valuation allowance adjustment related to anticipatory foreign tax credit asset rendering final values for the Companys deferred tax liability See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements presented in this report For information on the conversion of Aflac Japan from a branch to a subsidiary see General Business under this Business section above 11 Item 1 Business DoddFrank Act Title VII of the DoddFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 DoddFrank and regulations issued thereunder in particular rules to require central clearing for certain types of derivatives may have an impact on Aflacs derivative activity including activity on behalf of Aflac Japan In addition in 2015 and 2016 six US financial regulators including the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission CFTC issued final rules regarding the exchange of initial margin IM and variation margin VM for uncleared swaps that impose greater obligations on swap dealers regarding uncleared swaps with certain counterparties such as Aflac The requirements of such rules with respect to VM as well as similar regulations in Europe became effective on March 1 2017 Full compliance with respect to all counterparties was required by September 1 2017 The requirements of such rules with respect to IM are currently being phased in and will be fully implemented by September 1 2020 In October of 2017 the CFTC and the European Commission each finalized comparability determinations that permit certain swap dealers who are subject to both regulatory margin regimes to take advantage of substituted compliance by complying with one set of margin requirements The margin requirements are expected to result in more stringent collateral requirements and to affect other aspects of Aflacs derivatives activity The DoddFrank Act also established a Federal Insurance Office FIO under the US Treasury Department to monitor all aspects of the insurance industry and of business lines other than certain health insurance certain longterm care insurance and crop insurance Traditionally US insurance companies have been regulated primarily by state insurance departments The FIO does not directly regulate the insurance industry but under DoddFrank it has the power to preempt state insurance regulations that are inconsistent with international agreements reached by the federal government subject to certain requirements and restrictions The FIO and certain federal agencies must achieve consensus positions with the state insurance regulators when taking positions on insurance proposals by certain international forums In December 2013 the FIO released a report entitled How To Modernize And Improve The System Of Insurance Regulation In The United States The report was required by the DoddFrank Act and included 18 recommended areas of nearterm reform for the states including addressing capital adequacy and safetysoundness issues reform of insurer resolution practices and reform of marketplace regulation The report also listed nine recommended areas for direct federal involvement in insurance regulation Some of the recommendations outlined in the FIO report released in December 2013 have been implemented The National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers Reform Act signed into law in January 2015 simplifies the agent and broker licensing process across state lines The FIO has also engaged with the supervisory colleges to monitor financial stability and identify regulatory gaps for large national and internationally active insurers The current US presidential administration and Congress have made recent attempts to reform or repeal certain provisions of the DoddFrank Act some of which have been implemented For example in 2018 President Trump signed into law the Economic Growth Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act Members of Congress have also introduced multiple bills that would impact or eliminate the FIO The Federal Reserve is developing a rulemaking regarding the Financial Stability Oversight Councils the Council ability to designate nonbank financial companies as Systemically Important Financial Institutions and pursuant to an Executive Order the Treasury Department released a report on the Councils designation authority The Company cannot predict with any degree of certainty what impact if any such proposals will have on Aflacs business financial condition or results of operations Further Information For further information concerning Aflac US operations regulation change of control and dividend restrictions see the Aflac US Segment subsection of MDA and Notes 2 and 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report Privacy and Cybersecurity The collection maintenance use protection disclosure and disposal of individually identifiable data by the Companys businesses are regulated at the international federal and state levels These laws and rules are subject to change by legislation or administrative or judicial interpretation Various state laws address the unauthorized access and acquisition of personal information and the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health data to the extent they are more restrictive than those contained in the privacy and security provisions in the federal GrammLeachBliley Act of 1999 GLBA and in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 HIPAA For example in June 2018 California passed a data privacy law scheduled to become effective January 2020 that requires businesses to provide California consumers rights to access delete and restrict certain uses of their personal information HIPAA also requires that the Company imposes privacy and security requirements on its business associates as such term is defined in the HIPAA regulations With regard to personal information obtained from policyholders the insured or others Aflac Japan is 12 Item 1 Business regulated in Japan by the Act on the Protection of Personal Information APPI and guidelines issued by FSA and other governmental authorities The FSA updated its guidelines regarding cybersecurity in October 2018 Cybersecurity also continues to be an area of evolving focus for US legislation and regulatory activity In March 2017 new cybersecurity regulation issued by the New York Department of Financial Services NYDFS went into effect that requires covered entities including Aflac New York to maintain an information security program meeting certain security data disposal audit activity monitoring and data encryption requirements In October 2017 the NAIC adopted an Insurance Data Security Model Law that may be adopted in whole or in part by US states in which the Companys subsidiaries are licensed Other states have adopted and the Company expects will continue to pass legislation and issue regulations related to cybersecurity The Company anticipates assesses and if necessary modifies its information security program to accommodate such changes The Companys Board of Directors has adopted an information security policy directing management to establish and operate an information security program with the goal of ensuring that the Companys information assets and data and the data of its customers are appropriately protected The Board has delegated oversight of the Companys information security program to the Audit and Risk Committee The Companys senior officers including its Global Security and Chief Information Security Officer are responsible for the operation of the information security program and regularly communicate with the Audit and Risk Committee on the program including with respect to the state of the program compliance with applicable regulations current and evolving threats and recommendations for changes in the information security program The information security program also includes a cybersecurity incident response plan that is designed to provide a management framework across Company functions for a coordinated assessment and response to potential security incidents This framework establishes a protocol to report certain incidents to the Global Security and Chief Information Security Officer and other senior officers with the goal of timely assessing such incidents determining applicable disclosure requirements and communicating with the Audit and Risk Committee The incident response plan directs the executive officers to report certain incidents immediately and directly to the Lead NonManagement Director Other Operations The Companys other operations include the Parent Company results of reinsurance retrocession activities and a printing subsidiary For

The Company faces a wide range of risks and its continued success depends on its ability to identify prioritize and appropriately manage enterprise risk exposures Readers should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this Form 10K These risks and other factors may affect forwardlooking statements including those in this document or made by the Company elsewhere such as in earnings release webcasts investor conference presentations or press releases The risks and uncertainties described herein may not be the only ones facing the Company Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that the Company currently believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect its business If any of the following risks and uncertainties develops into actual events there could be a material impact on the Company Difficult conditions in global capital markets and the economy could have a material adverse effect on the Companys investments capital position revenue profitability and liquidity and harm the Companys business The Companys results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the global capital markets and the global economy generally including in its two primary operating markets of the United States and Japan Weak global financial markets impact the value of the Companys existing investment portfolio influence opportunities for new investments and may contribute to generally weak economic fundamentals which can have a negative impact on its operating activities In recent years global capital markets have been severely impacted by several major events The financial crisis that began in the latter part of 2008 saw dramatic declines in investment values and weak economic conditions as the global financial system came under extreme pressure Although US markets began recovering in late 2009 and 2010 Europe continued to struggle under a severely weakened banking system and investor concerns with sovereign debt levels Following a period of unprecedented intervention by governments and central banks including the US Federal Reserve and European Central Bank ECB financial conditions improved from the dire conditions of the global financial crisis global recession and European debt crisis More recently global markets have experienced bouts of volatility due to uncertainty surrounding a British exit from the European Union Japans continued recovery amidst assorted policy changes volatility in global commodity prices including oil divergent monetary policies in the United States versus many other developed economies heightened concerns surrounding the Chinese economy and increasing protectionism in US foreign trade policy While capital and market conditions have been generally favorable in the last year volatility increased in the fourth quarter and the prospect for increased volatility remains A recent shift in the global trading policies by the US and subsequent trade conflict with China has raised concerns about a slowdown of the Chinese economy In addition the US and Japan are engaged in discussions regarding changes to tariffs and trade agreements While it is not expected that the Companys products would be directly impacted by tariff any resulting economic downturn could adversely affect the Company Activity by the government of North Korea in 2018 was the subject of increasing focus for a number of other governments including those of the United States and Japan Although hostile rhetoric has decreased such North Korean activity and related geopolitical risk could have a significant impact on financial market conditions across the world Under certain circumstances government actions taken in response to the North Korean situation could have a material impact on the Companys Japan and US operations and financial performance including the indirect impact of potentially severe and prolonged capital market volatility and disruption As the Company holds a significant amount of fixed maturity securities issued by borrowers located in many different parts of the world including a large portion issued by banks and financial institutions sovereigns and other corporate borrowers in the United States and Europe its financial results are directly influenced by global financial markets A retrenchment of the recent strength of the capital markets could adversely affect the Companys financial condition including its capital position and overall profitability Market volatility and recessionary pressures could result in significant realized or unrealized losses due to severe price declines driven by increases in interest rates or credit spreads defaults in payment of principal or interest or credit rating downgrades Following the election of Shinzo Abe as Prime Minister of Japan in December 2012 the new administration adopted a new set of financial measures to stimulate the Japanese economy including imposing negative interest rates on excess bank reserves In December 2014 and October 2017 snapelections the ruling Liberal Democratic Party LDP won decisive victories further strengthening Mr Abes ability to continue with economic reforms and address key policy challenges In September 2018 Mr Abe won reelection to another threeyear term as president of the LDP Most recently the Bank of Japan BoJ signaled to hold its policy rate at zero and to continue yield curve control to maintain a targeted 15 Item 1A Risk Factors yield on the 10year Japan Government Bond JGB Prime Minister Abes election victories may result in the continuation of current monetary policy but there can be no guarantee that this is the case Japan is the largest market for the Companys products and the Company owns substantial holdings in JGBs Government actions to stimulate the economy affect the value of the Companys existing holdings its reinvestment rate on new investments in JGBs or other yendenominated assets and consumer behavior relative to the Companys suite of products The additional government debt from fiscal stimulus actions could adversely impact the Japan sovereign credit profile which could in turn lead to volatility in Japanese capital and currency markets The Companys investment portfolio has sizeable credit positions in many other geographic areas of the world including the Middle East Latin America Asia and other emerging markets Deterioration in their underlying economies sovereign credit worthiness or financial market conditions could negatively impact the Companys financial position While the Company has continued to add floating rate investments to its investment portfolio most of its investment portfolio holdings are incomeproducing bonds that provide a fixed level of income Many of the Companys investments were made at the relatively low level of interest rates prevailing over the last decade Any increase in the market yields of the Companys holdings due to an increase in interest rates could create substantial unrealized losses in the Companys portfolio as discussed further in a separate risk factor in this section of the Form 10K The Company needs liquidity to pay its operating expenses dividends on its common stock interest on its debt and liabilities For a further description of the Companys liquidity needs including maturing indebtedness see the Capital Resources and Liquidity section of MDA in this report In the event the Companys current resources do not meet its needs the Company may need to seek additional financing The Companys access to additional funding will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions the general availability of credit to the financial services industry and its credit rating Should investors become concerned with any of the Companys investment holdings including the concentration in JGBs its access to market sources of funding could be negatively impacted There is a possibility that lenders or debt investors may also become concerned if the Company incurs large investment losses or if the level of the Companys business activity decreases due to a market downturn or there are further adverse economic trends in the United States or Japan specifically or generally in developed markets Similarly the Companys access to funds may be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions See more information on recent rating actions later in this Risk Factors section Broad economic factors such as consumer spending business investment government spending the volatility and strength of the capital markets and inflation all affect the business and economic environment and indirectly the amount and profitability of the Companys business In an economic downturn characterized by higher unemployment lower family income lower corporate earnings lower business investment and lower consumer spending the demand for financial and insurance products could be adversely affected This adverse effect could be particularly significant for companies such as Aflac that distribute supplemental discretionary insurance products primarily through the worksite in the event that economic conditions result in a decrease in the number of new hires and total employees Adverse changes in the economy could potentially lead the Companys customers to be less inclined to purchase supplemental insurance coverage or to decide to cancel or modify existing insurance coverage which could adversely affect the Companys premium revenue results of operations and financial condition The Company is unable to predict the course of the global financial markets or the recurrence duration or severity of disruptions in such markets The Company is exposed to significant interest rate risk which may adversely affect its results of operations financial condition and liquidity The Company has substantial investment portfolios that support its policy liabilities Low levels of interest rates on investments experienced in Japan and the United States over the last decade have reduced the level of investment income earned by the Company The Companys overall level of investment income will be negatively impacted in a persistent lowinterestrate environment While the Company generally seeks to maintain a diversified portfolio of fixedincome investments that reflects the cash flow and duration characteristics of the liabilities it supports the Company may not be able to fully mitigate the interest rate risk of its assets relative to its liabilities The Companys exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to the ability to invest future cash flows to support the interest rate assumption made at the time the Companys products were priced and the related reserving assumptions were established A sustained decline in interest rates could hinder the Companys ability to earn the returns assumed in the pricing and the reserving for its products at the time they were sold and issued Due to low interest rates the Companys ability to earn the returns it expects may also influence the Companys ability to develop and price attractive new products and could impact its overall 16 Item 1A Risk Factors sales levels The Companys first sector products are more interest rate sensitive than third sector products As discussed in Item 1 Business beginning in 2013 Aflac Japan began to curtail sales of first sector savingstype products due to persistent low interest rates in Japan The continuing negative interest rate imposed by the BoJ on excess bank reserves could continue to have a negative impact on the distribution and pricing of these products A rise in interest rates could improve the Companys ability to earn higher rates of return on future investments as well as floating rate investments held in its investment portfolio However an increase in the differential of shortterm US and Japan interest rates would increase the cost of hedging a portion of the US dollardenominated assets in the Aflac Japan segment into yen which could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business results of operations or financial condition T he Companys floating rate investments typically bear interest based on the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR Regulatory and industry initiatives to eliminate LIBOR as an interest rate benchmark may create uncertainty in the valuation of LIBORbased loans as well as for other LIBORbased derivatives and assets This may adversely impact both pricing and liquidity in such instruments The Company is unable to predict with certainty how LIBOR elimination may impact markets pricing liquidity and other factors or the Companys activities Changes in interest rates impact unrealized gains and losses of fixed income securities in the Companys investment portfolio however they do not have a direct impact on the related valuation of the corresponding liabilities Prolonged periods of low interest rates as have been experienced in recent years heighten the risk of future increases in interest rates because an increasing proportion of the Companys investment portfolio includes investments that bear lower rates of return than the embedded book yield of the investment portfolio A rise in interest rates could decrease the fair value of the Companys debt securities Some of the insurance products that Aflac sells in the United States and Japan provide cash surrender values A rise in interest rates could trigger significant policy surrenders which might require the Company to sell investment assets and recognize unrealized losses This situation is commonly referred to as disintermediation risk The Company generally invests its assets to match the duration and cash flow characteristics of its policy liabilities and therefore would not expect to realize most of these gains or losses however the Companys risk is that unforeseen events or economic conditions such as changes in interest rates resulting from governmental monetary policies domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond the Companys control will reduce the effectiveness of this strategy These events or economic conditions could either cause the Company to dispose of some or all of these investments prior to their maturity or increase the risk that the issuers of these securities may default or may require impairment which could result in the Company having to recognize such gains or losses Rising interest rates also negatively impact the SMR since unrealized losses on the availableforsale investment portfolio factor into the ratio For regulatory accounting purposes for Aflac Japan there are certain requirements for realizing impairments that could be triggered by rising interest rates negatively impacting Aflac Japans earnings and corresponding dividends and capital deployment Further interest rate risk is still an inherent portfolio business and capital risk for the Company and significant changes in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated results of operations financial condition or cash flows through realized losses impairments changes in unrealized positions and liquidity For more information regarding interest rate risk see the Interest Rate Risk subsection within the Market Risks of Financial Instruments section of MDA in this report The Companys concentration of business in Japan poses risks to its operations The Companys operations in Japan including realized gains and losses on Aflac Japans investment portfolio accounted for 70 of the Companys total revenues for both 2018 and 2017  compared with 71 in 2016  The Japanese operations accounted for 84 of the Companys total assets at December 31 2018  compared with 83 at December 31 2017  Further because of the concentration of the Companys business in Japan and its need for longdated yendenominated assets the Company has a substantial concentration of JGBs in its investment portfolio As such the Company has material exposure to the Japanese economy geopolitical climate political regime and other factors that generally determine a countrys creditworthiness Specifically the nationally recognized statistical rating organizations  NRSROs or rating agencies credit rating agencies registered with the SEC have placed increased scrutiny on JGBs which are a significant component of the Companys overall investment portfolio resulting in downgrades as discussed later in this Risk Factors section The Company seeks to match investment currency and interest rate risk to its yen liabilities The low level of interest rates available on yendenominated securities has a negative effect on overall net investment income A large portion of 17 Item 1A Risk Factors the cash available for reinvestment each year is deployed in yendenominated instruments and subject to the low level of yen interest rates Any potential deterioration in Japan  s credit quality market access the overall economy of Japan or Japanese market volatility could adversely impact the business of Aflac in general and specifically Aflac Japan and its related results of operations and financial condition The Company is exposed to foreign currency fluctuations in the yendollar exchange rate Due to the size of Aflac Japan where functional currency is the Japanese yen fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the yen and the US dollar can have a significant effect on the Companys reported financial position and results of operations Aflac Japans premiums and approximately half of its investment income are received in yen and its claims and most expenses are paid in yen Aflac Japan purchases yendenominated assets and US dollardenominated assets which may be hedged to yen to support yendenominated policy liabilities These and other yendenominated financial statement items are however translated into US dollars for financial reporting purposes Accordingly fluctuations in the yendollar exchange rate can have a significant effect on the Companys reported financial position and results of operations In periods when yen weakens translating yen into US dollars causes fewer US dollars to be reported When yen strengthens translating yen into US dollars causes more US dollars to be reported Any unrealized foreign currency translation adjustments are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income As a result yen weakening has the effect of suppressing current year results in relation to the prior year while yen strengthening has the effect of magnifying current year results in relation to the prior year In addition the weakening of the yen relative to the US dollar will generally adversely affect the value of the Companys yendenominated investments in US dollar terms The Company engages in certain foreign currency hedging activities for the purpose of hedging the yen exposure to its net investment in operations in Japan These hedging activities are limited in scope and the Company cannot provide assurance that these activities will be effective Unhedged US dollardenominated securities held by Aflac Japan are exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations which impact SMR In periods of yen strengthening the unhedged US dollardenominated investments will experience unrealized foreign exchange losses negatively impacting SMR This impact increases when the size of the unhedged US dollardenominated portfolio increases which can occur due to the purchase of additional unhedged US dollardenominated investments or through termination or expiration of existing hedges Unrealized currency gains and losses on unhedged US dollardenominated securities are monetized or in other words are economically realized only upon converting the proceeds from the sale maturity or redemption of these securities to yen which primarily occurs when yen are needed to satisfy policyholder obligations or other business expenses of Aflac Japan To mitigate exposure to the foreign exchange risk from US dollardenominated investments and to reduce SMR volatility the Company engages in certain currency hedging activities However these hedging activities are limited in scope and the Company cannot provide assurance that its hedging strategies will be effective As a result periods of unusually volatile currency exchange rates could result in limitations on dividends available to the Parent Company As indicated in the Item 1 Business the Company has determined that the unhedged US dollardenominated investment portfolio acts as a natural economic currency hedge of a portion of the Companys investment in Aflac Japan against erosion of economic value However the unhedged US dollardenominated investment portfolio at the same time creates an unmatched foreign currency exposure and subjects Aflac Japan to volatility in regulatory capital and earnings which may adversely impact Aflac Japans ability to pay dividends to the Parent Company The overall investment strategy in Aflac Japan is guided primarily by the objective of securing the longterm financial strength of Aflac Japan and funding of yen liabilities As a result the Company has historically maintained and currently maintains the size of the unhedged portfolio at levels below the stressed economic surplus in Aflac Japan However there can be no assurance that this strategy will be successful Furthermore for regulatory accounting purposes there are certain requirements for realizing impairments that could be triggered by changes in the rate of exchange between the yen and US dollar and could negatively impact Aflac Japans earnings and the corresponding dividends and capital deployment Additionally the Company is exposed to currency risk when yen cash flows are converted into US dollars resulting in an increase or decrease in the Companys US dollardenominated cash flows and earnings when exchange gains or losses respectively are realized This primarily occurs when the Company dividends funds from Aflac Japan to the Parent Company but it also has an impact when cash in the form of yen is converted to US dollars for investment into US dollardenominated assets The exchange rates prevailing at the time of dividend payment may differ from the exchange rates prevailing at the time the yen profits were earned In 2018 the Parent Company entered into forward contracts to 18 Item 1A Risk Factors accomplish a dual objective of hedging foreign currency exchange rate risk related to dividend payments by Aflac Japan and reducing enterprisewide hedge costs If the markets experience a significant strengthening of yen this could cause cash strain at the Parent Company as a result of cash collateral and potentially cash settlement requirements Based on the timing and severity of exchange rate fluctuations combined with the level of outstanding activity in this program the cash strain at the Parent Company could be significant For more information regarding unhedged US dollardenominated securities see the risk factor below entitled Lack of availability of acceptable yendenominated investments could adversely affect the Companys results of operations financial position or liquidity For more information regarding foreign currency risk see the Currency Risk subsection within the Market Risks of Financial Instruments section of MDA Lack of availability of acceptable yendenominated investments could adversely affect the Companys results of operations financial position or liquidity The Company attempts to match both the duration and currency of its assets with its liabilities This is very difficult for Aflac Japan due to the lack of available longdated yendenominated fixed income instruments beyond JGBs Prior to the onset of the financial crisis of 2008 the Company was focused on investing cash flows in JGBs which had relatively low yields and utilizing private placement and perpetual securities to gain additional yield extend the duration of the investment portfolio and maintain yen exposure Given call activity with respect to certain of the Companys legacy private placement investments the Company has added a modest amount of yendenominated private placements to its investment portfolio in recent periods The investment in private placements carries risk associated with illiquidity which is managed and monitored by the Company Starting in 2012 Aflac Japan augmented its investment strategy to include US dollardenominated investments some of which could then be hedged back to yen Initially this program focused on public investmentgrade bonds but has evolved over time to include US dollardenominated investmentgrade commercial mortgage loans infrastructure debt as well as other loan types high yield bonds and US equity securities The Company plans to continue adding other instruments denominated in US dollars including floating rate investments to improve the portfolio diversification andor return profile Some of the US dollardenominated asset classes that the Company has added and anticipates continuing to add have less liquidity than investmentgrade corporate bonds These strategies will continue to increase the Companys exposure to US interest rates credit spreads and other risks The Company has increased foreign exchange risk exposure as the comprehensive hedging program may not always correlate to the underlying US dollardenominated assets thereby increasing earnings volatility These risks can significantly impact the Companys consolidated results of operations financial position or liquidity Investing in US dollardenominated investments in Aflac Japan also creates an unmatched foreign currency exposure and related SMR volatility as Aflac Japans insurance liabilities are yendenominated Although the Company engages in certain foreign exchange hedging activities to partially mitigate this risk and such hedged assets may be used to satisfy yendenominated insurance liabilities and other business obligations important risks remain Foreign exchange derivatives used for hedging are periodically settled which results in cash receipt or payment at maturity or early termination The Companys foreign exchange derivatives are typically shorterdated than the underlying US dollardenominated investments being hedged which creates rollover risks within the hedging program that could increase the cost of such derivatives If the Company reduces the notional amount of foreign exchange derivatives prior to the maturity of the hedged US dollardenominated investments the foreign exchange gains or losses on the US dollardenominated investments remain economically unrealized These gains or losses are only economically realized or monetized  through sale  maturity or redemption of the investments and concurrent conversion to yen However the Company may not realize the benefit of offsetting adverse cash settlements on hedging derivatives with cash receipts on the US dollardenominated investments if the currency exchange rates move in an adverse direction before the investments are converted to yen or if the investments are never converted to yen As an example of the latter if the Companys actual insurance risk experience in Japan is as expected or more favorable than expected the need for yen to pay expenses and claims would correspondingly remain at or below expected levels thereby diminishing operational requirements to convert US dollardenominated investments to yen Since 2012 the cumulative net cash settlements on derivatives hedging currency exposure of Aflac Japans US dollardenominated investments were an outflow of 39 billion as of December 31 2018 These outflows or cumulative net negative settlements are associated with foreign exchange derivatives on existing US dollardenominated investments and hedged investments that have since been sold matured or redeemed and may or may have not been converted to yen Furthermore the settlements include instances where the initial foreign exchange derivative notional amounts were reduced prior to the maturity of the hedged 19 Item 1A Risk Factors investments The settlement of the foreign exchange derivatives is reported in the investing activities section of the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows in the line item Settlement of derivatives net For more information regarding unhedged US dollardenominated securities see the risk factor above entitled The Company is exposed to foreign currency fluctuations in the yendollar exchange rate For more information regarding Aflac Japans US dollardenominated investments and hedging activities see the Hedging Activities subsection within the Item 7 MDA section in this report and for more information regarding foreign currency risk see the Currency Risk subsection within the Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk section in this report US tax audit risk related to conversion of the Japan branch to a subsidiary could adversely impact the Companys financial position The conversion of the Japan branch to a legal subsidiary which the Company executed in the second quarter of 2018 was a complex taxfree transaction that is conditioned on the continued validity of a private letter ruling the Company received from the Internal Revenue Service IRS Notwithstanding the receipt of the private letter ruling the IRS could determine that the Japan branch conversion should be treated as a taxable transaction For example the IRS could conclude that the representations assumptions and covenants on which the private letter ruling is based are untrue not accurate or have not been fulfilled If the IRS made such a conclusion the Company could incur significant US federal income tax liabilities or litigation costs to defend the taxfree treatment of the transaction outlined by the private letter ruling Such liabilities or costs could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business results of operations and financial condition If future policy benefits claims or expenses exceed those anticipated in establishing premiums and reserves the Companys financial results would be adversely affected The Company establishes premiums for many of its policies on assumptions for morbidity mortality longevity and persistency The Company also establishes and carries as a liability reserves based on estimates of how much will be required to pay for future benefits and claims on its policies The Company calculates these reserves using various assumptions and estimates including premiums the Company will receive over the assumed life of the policy the timing frequency and severity of the events covered by the insurance policy and the investment returns on the assets the Company purchases with a portion of its net cash flow from operations The assumptions and estimates that the Company uses in establishing premiums and reserves depend on the Companys judgment regarding the likelihood of future events and are inherently uncertain Many factors can cause actual outcomes to deviate from these assumptions and estimates such as changes in economic conditions changes in government healthcare policy advances in medical technology changes in treatment patterns and changes in average lifespan Accordingly the Company cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts that it will pay for or the timing of payment of actual benefits and claims or whether the assets supporting the policy liabilities will grow to the level the Company assumes prior to payment of benefits or claims If the Companys actual experience is different from its assumptions or estimates the Companys reserves may prove inadequate As a result the Company would incur a charge to earnings in the period in which it determines such a shortfall exists which could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business results of operations and financial condition Generally lower mortality decreases the profitability of third sector products in Japan as more policyholders will survive into ages where they have a higher rate of claim incidence This assumption can impact pricing and reserving For instance Japan FSA periodically requires updates to their Standard mortality tables for FSA reserves An update to the Standard mortality tables was performed in April 2018 applicable to all business issued after that date For business that is inforce prior to the update the change in mortality table would not have an impact For new issues the updated mortality tables would be included in our reserve assumptions and slow the emergence of FSA earnings for third sector products and therefore will have an impact on pricing returns The Company adjusts pricing assumptions as new products are developed to adjust for these mortality assumptions The success of the Companys business depends in part on effective information technology systems and on continuing to develop and implement improvements in technology The Companys business depends in large part on its technology systems for interacting with employers policyholders sales associates and brokers and the Companys business strategy involves providing customers with easytouse products to meet their needs and ensuring employees have the technology in place to support those needs Some of the Companys information technology systems and software are older legacytype systems that are less efficient and require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain or upgrade to current standards including 20 Item 1A Risk Factors adequate business continuity procedures The Company is in a continual state of upgrading and enhancing its business systems however these changes tend to challenge the Companys complex integrated environment The Companys success is dependent in large part on maintaining or improving the effectiveness of existing systems and continuing to develop and enhance information systems that support its business processes in a costefficient manner If the Company does not maintain the effectiveness of its systems the Companys operations and reputation could be adversely affected and it could be exposed to litigation as well as to regulatory proceedings and fines or penalties Competition could adversely affect the Companys ability to increase or maintain its market share or profitability The Company operates in a competitive environment and in an industry that is subject to ongoing changes from market pressures brought about by customer demands legislative reform marketing practices and changes to health care and health insurance delivery These factors require the Company to anticipate market trends and make changes to differentiate the Companys products and services from those of its competitors The Company also faces the potential of competition from existing or new companies in the United States and Japan that have not historically been active in the supplemental health insurance industry but some of which have greater financial marketing and management resources than the Company does Failure to anticipate market trends andor to differentiate the Companys products and services can affect the Companys ability to retain or grow profitable lines of business Further as employers and brokers are increasingly requesting a fullsuite of products from one insurance provider a failure to react and adapt to these demands could result in decreased sales or market share Similarly a failure to meet evolving customer demands through innovative product development effective distribution channels and continuous investment in the Companys technology could result in lower revenues and less favorable policy terms and conditions which could adversely affect the Companys operating results Events including those external to the Companys operations could damage the Companys reputation The Company has made significant investments in the Aflac brand over a long period of time Because insurance products are intangible the Companys ability to compete for and maintain policyholders relies to a large extent on consumer trust in the Companys business The perception of unfavorable business practices or financial weakness could create doubt regarding the Companys ability to honor the commitments it has made to its policyholders Maintaining the Companys stature as a trustworthy insurer and responsible corporate citizen which helps support the strength of the Companys brand is critical to the Companys reputation and the failure or perceived failure to do so could adversely affect the Companys brand value financial condition and results of operations For example negative publicity or allegations of unfavorable business practices or poor governance can be rapidly and widely shared over social or traditional media or other means and could reduce demand for the Companys insurance products reduce the Companys ability to recruit and retain employees or lead to greater regulatory scrutiny of the Companys operations Sales of the Companys products and services are dependent on its ability to attract retain and support a network of qualified sales associates brokers and employees in the United States and sales associates and other distribution partners in Japan The Companys sales could be adversely affected if its sales networks deteriorate or if the Company does not adequately provide support training and education for its existing network In the United States competition exists for sales associates and brokers with demonstrated ability In Japan the Companys sales results are dependent upon its relationship with sales associates and other distribution partners including its alliance partner Japan Post which in recent periods has accounted for approximately 25 of Aflac Japans third sector sales The Company competes with other insurers and financial institutions primarily on the basis of its products compensation support services and financial rating The Companys inability to attract and retain qualified sales associates brokers and other distribution partners including its alliance partners in Japan could have a material adverse effect on the Companys sales results of operations and financial condition The Companys sales associates and brokers are independent contractors and may sell products of its competitors If the Companys competitors offer products that are more attractive or pay higher commissions than the Company does any or all of these distribution partners may concentrate their efforts on selling the Companys competitors products instead of the Companys In addition to the Companys commissioned sales force in the United States Aflac has expanded its sales leadership team to include a salaried sales force of over 200 market directors and broker sales professionals The Companys ability to attract and retain top talent in these salaried roles has a material impact on its sales success 21 Item 1A Risk Factors Additionally as the Japan and US employment markets continue to evolve there is risk that the Companys practices regarding attracting developing and retaining employees may not be fully effective Failure to successfully meet and maintain sufficient levels of employees may diminish the Companys ability to achieve its financial and compliance objectives both of which are time consuming and personnelintensive Interruption in telecommunication information technology and other operational systems or a failure to maintain the security confidentiality integrity or privacy of sensitive data residing on such systems could harm the Companys business The Company stores confidential policyholder employee agent and other proprietary information on its information technology systems In addition the Company depends heavily on its telecommunication information technology and other operational systems and on the integrity and timeliness of data it uses to run its businesses and service its customers These systems may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events or circumstances wholly or partly beyond the Companys control Additionally design flaws may exist in certain systems processes software or configurations that in turn may result in system failure data corruption or compromise Despite the Companys implementation of a variety of security measures to defend against threats incurred on a daily basis its information technology and other systems as well as those of third party providers and participants in the Companys distribution channels have been and will likely continue to be subject to physical or electronic breakins unauthorized tampering security breaches or other cyberattacks that may result in the failure to adequately maintain the security confidentiality integrity or privacy of sensitive data including personal information relating to customers and prospective customers or in the misappropriation of the Companys intellectual property or proprietary information From time to time the Company its third party providers and participants in the Companys distribution channels have experienced and will likely continue to experience such events Although the minor data leakage issues the Company has experienced to date have not had a material effect on its business there is no assurance that the Companys security systems or processes will prevent or mitigate future breakins tampering security breaches or other cyberattacks Interruption in telecommunication information technology and other operational systems or a failure to maintain the security confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data residing on such systems whether due to actions by the Company or others including third party providers and participants in the companys distribution channels could delay or disrupt the Companys ability to do business and service its customers seriously harm the Companys brand and reputation as well as the Companys ability to compete effectively subject it to regulatory sanctions and other claims lead to a loss of customers and revenues and otherwise adversely affect the Companys business In addition the costs to address or remediate system interruptions or security threats and vulnerabilities whether before or after an incident could be significant While the Company continues to invest in the infrastructure of its data security programs the Company as well as its third party providers and participants in the Companys distribution channels have been and will likely continue to be the target of unauthorized access social engineering phishing cyberattacks web application attacks computer viruses or other malicious codes or other computerrelated penetrations Although the Company attempts to manage its exposure to such events through the purchase of cyber liability insurance such events are inherently unpredictable and insurance may not be sufficient to protect the Company against all losses As a result events such as these could adversely affect the Companys financial condition or results of operation If the Company fails to comply with restrictions on customer privacy and information security including taking steps to ensure that its thirdparty service providers and business associates who access store process or transmit sensitive customer information maintain its security integrity confidentiality and availability the Companys reputation and business operations could be materially adversely affected The collection maintenance use protection disclosure and disposal of individually identifiable data by the Companys businesses are regulated at the international federal and state levels These laws and rules are subject to change by legislation or administrative or judicial interpretation Various state laws address the unauthorized access and acquisition of personal information and the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health data to the extent they are more restrictive than those contained in the privacy and security provisions in the federal GLBA and in the HIPAA HIPAA also requires that the Company imposes privacy and security requirements on its business associates as such term is defined in the HIPAA regulations With regard to personal information obtained from policyholders the insured or others Aflac Japan is regulated in Japan by the APPI and guidelines issued by FSA and other governmental authorities The Company relies on third parties and in some cases subcontractors to provide information technology and data services It also relies on various parties in its distribution channels including agencies banks and Japan Post in Japan as well as sales associates and brokers in the United States to provide services to prospective and existing customers 22 Item 1A Risk Factors Although the Company provides for appropriate protections through its contracts and performs information security risk assessments of its thirdparty service providers and business associates the Company still has limited control over their actions and practices In addition despite the security measures the Company has in place to ensure compliance with applicable laws and rules the Companys facilities and systems and those of the Companys thirdparty providers and participants in its distribution channels may be vulnerable to security breaches acts of vandalism or theft computer viruses misplaced or lost data programming andor human errors or other similar events From time to time the Company its third party providers and participants in the Companys distribution channels have experienced and will likely continue to experience such events In such cases notification to affected individuals state and federal regulators state attorneys general and media may be required depending upon the number of affected individuals and whether personal information including health or financial data was subject to unauthorized access The US Congress and many states are considering new privacy and security requirements that would apply to the Companys business Compliance with new privacy and security laws requirements and new regulations may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes new limitations or constraints on the Companys business models the development of new administrative processes and the effects of potential noncompliance by the Companys business associates They also may impose further restrictions on the Companys collection disclosure and use of customer identifiable data that are housed in one or more of the Companys administrative databases Noncompliance with any privacy laws or any security breach involving the misappropriation loss theft or other unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential customer information whether by the Company or by one of its third parties could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business reputation brand and results of operations including material fines and penalties compensatory special punitive and statutory damages consent orders regarding the Companys privacy and security practices adverse actions against the Companys licenses to do business and injunctive relief In addition under Japanese laws and regulations including the APPI if a leak or loss of personal information by Aflac Japan or its business associates should occur depending on factors such as the volume of personal data involved and the likelihood of other secondary damage Aflac Japan may be required to file reports to the FSA issue public releases explaining such incident to the public or become subject to an FSA business improvement order which could pose a risk to the Companys reputation Extensive regulation and changes in legislation can impact profitability and growth Aflacs insurance subsidiaries are subject to complex laws and regulations that are administered and enforced by a number of governmental authorities including the FSA and Ministry of Finance MOF in Japan and state insurance regulators the SEC the NAIC the FIO the US Department of Justice state attorneys general the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the US Treasury including the IRS in the United States each of which exercises a degree of interpretive latitude In addition proposals regarding the global regulation of insurance are under discussion and changes to corporate form that attend the conversion of Aflac Japan to a subsidiary may introduce new forms of regulation compared to those with which the Company has historically been subject For example AAMJ is licensed as a discretionary asset manager under the Japan Financial Instruments and Exchange Act and is subject to rules of the Japan Investment Advisors Association a selfregulatory organization with mandatory membership for Japan investment managers Consequently the Company is subject to the risk that compliance with any particular regulators or enforcement authoritys interpretation of a legal or regulatory issue may not result in compliance with another regulators or enforcement authoritys interpretation of the same issue particularly when compliance is judged in hindsight There is also a risk that any particular regulators or enforcement authoritys interpretation of a legal or regulatory issue may change over time to the Companys detriment In addition changes in the overall legal or regulatory environment may even absent any particular regulators or enforcement authoritys interpretation of an issue changing cause us to change the Companys views regarding the actions the Company needs to take from a legal or regulatory risk management perspective thus necessitating changes to the Companys practices that may in some cases limit its ability to grow or otherwise negatively impact the profitability of the Companys business The primary purpose of insurance company regulatory supervision is the protection of insurance policyholders rather than investors The extent of regulation varies but generally is governed by state statutes in the United States and by the FSA and the MOF in Japan These systems of supervision and regulation cover among other things  standards of establishing and setting premium rates and the approval thereof  standards of minimum capital and reserve requirements and solvency margins including RBC measures  restrictions on limitations on and required approval of certain transactions between the Companys insurance subsidiaries and their affiliates including management fee arrangements  restrictions on the nature quality and concentration of investments 23 Item 1A Risk Factors  restrictions on the types of terms and conditions that the Company can include in the insurance policies offered by its primary insurance operations  limitations on the amount of dividends that insurance subsidiaries can pay  the existence and licensing status of a company under circumstances where it is not writing new or renewal business  certain required methods of accounting  reserves for unearned premiums losses and other purposes  assignment of residual market business and potential assessments for the provision of funds necessary for the settlement of covered claims under certain policies provided by impaired insolvent or failed insurance companies  administrative practices requirements  imposition of fines and other sanctions Regulatory authorities periodically reexamine existing laws and regulations applicable to insurance companies and their products Changes in these laws and regulations or in interpretations thereof could have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition and results of operations If the Companys subsidiaries fail to meet the minimum capital or operational requirements established by its respective regulators they could be subject to examination or corrective action or the Companys financial strength ratings could be downgraded or both Various forms of federal oversight and regulation of insurance were signed into law by the prior US presidential administration For example the ACA gave the US federal government direct regulatory authority over the business of health insurance and made significant changes to the US health care insurance marketplace including the imposition of an individual medical insurance coverage mandate which has since been repealed effective 2019 by the Tax Act penalties on certain employers for failing to provide adequate coverage the creation of health insurance exchanges and proscriptions regarding coverage and exclusions as well as medical loss ratios The legislation also includes changes in government reimbursements and tax credits for individuals and employers and alters federal and state regulation of health insurers The ACA as enacted does not require material changes in the design of the Companys insurance products However indirect consequences of the legislation and regulations could present challenges that could potentially have an impact on the Companys sales model financial condition and results of operations The United States Congress may continue to consider legislation that would repeal and replace key provisions of the ACA There can be no assurance that any legislation affecting the ACA will be passed by Congress nor as to the ultimate timing or provisions of any such legislation nor as to the effect of any such legislation on the design or marketability of the Companys insurance products In addition DoddFrank intended to reduce risk of a financial crisis contains multiple provisions that could impact the Companys business as rules are finalized and implemented While it is difficult to isolate the impact of Dodd Frank from other government and central bank actions and general market conditions since the financial crisis the Company believes that the DoddFrank Act in particular bank capital requirements limits on proprietary trading and derivatives regulation has affected the value of its holdings in banks and other financial institutions and impacted pricing liquidity and the Companys general ability to conduct financial and capital market transactions Dodd Frank is expansive in scope and among other things requires the adoption of extensive regulations and numerous regulating decisions many of which have been adopted The presidential administration in the United States and Congress have stated proposals to reform or repeal certain provisions of the DoddFrank Act some of which have been implemented The Company cannot predict with any degree of certainty the ultimate effects if any that Dodd Frank or subsequent implementation of regulations and decisions will have on its US business financial condition or results of operations  Compliance with applicable laws and regulations is time consuming and personnelintensive and changes in these laws and regulations may materially increase the Companys direct and indirect compliance and other expenses of doing business thus having a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition and results of operations Tax rates applicable to the Company may change The Company is subject to taxation in Japan and in the US under federal and numerous state and local tax jurisdictions In preparing the Companys financial statements the Company estimates the amount of tax that will become payable but the Companys effective tax rate may be different than estimates due to numerous factors including accounting for income taxes the mix of earnings from Japan and the US the results of tax audits adjustments to the value of uncertain tax positions changes to estimates and other factors Further changes in US or Japan tax laws or interpretations of such laws could increase the Companys corporate taxes and reduce earnings 24 Item 1A Risk Factors The Tax Act was signed into law on December 22 2017 Among other things effective January 1 2018 the Tax Act reduced the US federal statutory corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 eliminated or reduced certain deductions and credits and limited the deductibility of interest expense and executive compensation The Tax Act also transitions international corporate taxation from a worldwide system to a modified territorial system which in light of the current tax treatment of Aflac Japan has the effect of subjecting the earnings of Aflac Japan to Japan taxation and subjecting the Companys other earnings including the consolidated earnings of the Parent Company to US taxation These changes became effective on January 1 2018 Because changes to tax rates are accounted for in the period of enactment during the period ended December 31 2017 the Company revalued its deferred tax assets and liabilities and recorded a net deferred tax liability reduction of 19 billion benefit in 2017 During the fourth quarter of 2018 the Company recorded an immaterial adjustment to the provisional amount of deferred tax liabilities DTLs related to the Japan tax computation and no valuation allowance adjustment related to anticipatory foreign tax credit asset rendering final values for the Companys deferred tax liability The impact of the Tax Act including the preliminary estimate for the change in tax rate that was recorded during the fourth quarter of 2017 adjustments booked during the fourth quarter of 2018 which rendered final values related to the tax rate and the Companys combined US and Japanese effective income tax rate may be adjusted in future periods possibly materially due to among other things changes in interpretations and assumptions the Company has made tax guidance that may be issued and actions the Company make take as a result of the Tax Act Without limiting the foregoing additional forthcoming guidance from the US Department of the Treasury andor the US IRS related to the Tax Act could significantly impact the level of valuation allowance respecting the amount of foreign tax credits claimed by the Company with regard to the operations of Aflac Japan In addition it remains difficult to predict the timing and effect that future tax law changes could have on the Companys earnings both in the US and in foreign jurisdictions Any of these factors could cause the Company to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current estimates If the Companys effective tax rate were to increase the Companys financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected Defaults downgrades widening credit spreads or other events impairing the value of the fixed maturity securities and loan receivables in the Companys investment portfolio may reduce the Companys earnings and capital position The Company is subject to the risk that the issuers andor guarantors of fixed maturity securities and loan receivables the Company owns may default on principal or interest A significant portion of the Companys portfolio represents an unsecured obligation of the issuer including some that may be subordinated to other debt in the issuers capital structure In these cases many factors can influence the overall creditworthiness of the issuer and ultimately its ability to service and repay the Companys holdings This can include changes in the global economy the companys assets strategy or management shifts in the dynamics of the industries in which they compete their access to additional funding and the overall health of the credit markets Factors unique to the Companys securities including contractual protections such as financial covenants or relative position in the issuers capital structure also influence the value of the Companys holdings Most of the Companys investments carry a rating by one or more of the NRSROs Any change in the rating agencies approach to evaluating credit and assigning an opinion could negatively impact the fair value of the Companys portfolio The Company employs a team of credit analysts to monitor the creditworthiness of the issuers in its portfolio Any creditrelated declines in the fair value of positions held in the Companys portfolio believed to be not temporary in nature will negatively impact the Companys net income and capital position through impairment and other credit related losses These losses would also affect the Companys solvency ratios in the United States and Japan Aflac Japan has certain regulatory accounting requirements for realizing impairments that could be triggered by creditrelated losses which may be different from US GAAP and statutory requirements These impairment losses could negatively impact Aflac Japans earnings and the corresponding dividends and capital deployment The Company is also subject to the risk that any collateral providing credit enhancement to the Companys positions could deteriorate These instruments may include senior secured first lien loans such as commercial mortgage loans bank loans middle market loans and loanbacked securities where the underlying loan or collateral notes may default on principal interest or other payments causing an adverse change in cash flows to the positions held in the Companys investment portfolio The Company is exposed to sovereign credit risk through instruments issued directly by governments and government entities as well as banks and other institutions that rely in part on the strength of the underlying government 25 Item 1A Risk Factors for their credit quality In addition to the United States and Japan many governments especially in Europe have been subject to rating downgrades due to the need for fiscal and budgetary remediation and structural reforms reduced economic activity and investment needed to support banks or other systemically important entities Additional downgrades or default of the Companys sovereign issuers will have a negative impact on its portfolio and could reduce the Companys earnings and capital In addition to the Companys exposure to the underlying fundamental credit strength of the issuers of its fixed maturity securities and the underlying risk of default the Company is also exposed to the general movement in credit market spreads A widening of credit spreads could reduce the value of the Companys existing portfolio create unrealized losses on its investment portfolio and reduce the Companys adjusted capital position which is used in determining the SMR in Japan This widening of credit spreads could however increase the net investment income on new credit investments Conversely a tightening of credit spreads could increase the value of the Companys existing portfolio and create unrealized gains on its investment portfolio This tightening of credit spreads could also reduce the net investment income available to the Company on new credit investments Increased market volatility also makes it difficult to value certain of the Companys investment holdings see the Critical Accounting Estimates section in Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of this Form 10K For more information regarding credit risk see the Credit Risk subsection of Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk of this Form 10K A decline in the creditworthiness of other financial institutions could adversely affect the Company The Company has exposure to and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry including broker dealers derivative counterparties commercial banks and other institutions The Company uses derivative instruments to mitigate various risks associated with its investment portfolio notes payable and subsidiary dividends The Company enters into a variety of agreements involving assorted instruments including foreign currency forward contracts foreign currency options foreign currency swaps and interest rate swaptions The Company  s use of derivatives results in financial exposure to derivative counterparties If the Companys counterparties fail or refuse to honor their obligations under derivative instruments the Companys hedges of the risks will be ineffective and the Companys financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected The Company engages in derivative transactions directly with unaffiliated third parties under International Swaps and Derivatives Association Inc ISDA agreements and other documentation Most of the ISDA agreements also include Credit Support Annexes CSAs provisions which generally provide for twoway collateral postings at the first dollar of exposure The Company mitigates the risk that counterparties to transactions might be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations by monitoring counterparty credit exposure and collateral value while generally requiring that collateral be posted at the outset of the transaction In addition a significant portion of the derivative transactions have provisions that give the counterparty the right to terminate the transaction upon a downgrade of Aflacs financial strength rating The actual amount of payments that the Company could be required to make depends on market conditions the fair value of outstanding affected transactions and other factors prevailing at and after the time of the downgrade If the Company is required to post collateral to support derivative contracts andor pay cash to settle the contracts at maturity the Companys liquidity could be strained In addition the Companys cleared swaps result in counterparty exposure to clearing brokers and central clearinghouses while this exposure is mitigated in part by clearinghouse and clearing broker capital and regulation no assurance can be provided that these counterparties will fulfill their obligations The Company also has exposure to counterparties to securities lending transactions in the event they fail to return loaned securities The Company is also exposed to the risk that there may be a decline in value of securities posted as collateral for securities lending programs or a decline in value of investments made with cash posted as collateral for such programs Further the Company has agreements with various financial institutions for the distribution of its insurance products For example at December 31 2018  the Company had agreements with 371 banks to market Aflacs products in Japan Sales through these banks represented 46 of Aflac Japans new annualized premium sales in 2018  Any material adverse effect on these or other financial institutions could also have an adverse effect on the Companys sales The Company has entered into significant reinsurance transactions with large highly rated counterparties Negative events or developments affecting any one of these counterparties could have an adverse effect on the Companys financial position or results of operations All of these risks related to exposure to other financial institutions could adversely impact the Companys consolidated results of operations and financial condition 26 Item 1A Risk Factors The determination of the amount of impairments taken on the Companys investments is based on significant valuation judgments and could materially impact its results of operations or financial position An investment in a fixed maturity security is impaired if the fair value falls below book value The Company regularly reviews its entire investment portfolio for declines in value The majority of the Companys investments are evaluated for otherthantemporary impairment using the Companys debt impairment model The Companys debt impairment model includes emphasis on the ultimate collection of the cash flows from its investments The determination of the amount of impairments under this model is based upon the Companys periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective securities Such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available For the Companys fixed maturity securities reported in the availableforsale portfolio the Company reports the investments at fair value in the statement of financial condition and records any unrealized gain or loss in the value of the asset in accumulated other comprehensive income For the Companys heldtomaturity securities portfolio the Company reports the investments at amortized cost Under the debt impairment model the determination of whether an impairment in value is other than temporary is based largely on the Companys evaluation of the issuer  s creditworthiness The Company must apply considerable judgment in determining the likelihood of the security recovering in value while the Company owns it Factors that may influence this include the Companys assessment of the issuers ability to continue making timely payments of interest and principal the overall level of interest rates and credit spreads and other factors The Company also verifies whether it has the intent to sell or if it is more likely than not the Company would be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost If the Company determines it is unlikely to recover the book value of the instrument prior to disposal of the security the Company will reduce the carrying value of the security to its fair value and recognize any associated impairment loss in the Companys consolidated statement of earnings or other comprehensive income depending on the nature of the loss For regulatory accounting purposes for Aflac Japan there are certain requirements for realizing impairments that could be triggered by rising interest rates creditrelated losses or changes in foreign exchange negatively impacting Aflac Japans earnings and corresponding dividend and capital deployment The Companys management updates its evaluations regularly as conditions change and as new information becomes available and reflects impairment losses in the Companys income statement when considered necessary Furthermore additional impairments may need to be taken in the future Historical trends may not be indicative of future impairments As a holding company the Parent Company depends on the ability of its subsidiaries to transfer funds to it to meet its debt service and other obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock The Parent Company is a holding company and has no direct operations and its most significant assets are the stock of its subsidiaries Because the Parent Company conducts its operations through its operating subsidiaries the Parent Company depends on those entities for dividends and other payments to generate the funds necessary to meet its debt service and other obligations to pay dividends on and conduct repurchases of its common stock and to make investments into its subsidiaries or external investment opportunities Aflac is domiciled in Nebraska and is subject to insurance regulations that impose certain limitations and restrictions on payments of dividends management fees loans and advances by Aflac to the Parent Company The Nebraska insurance statutes require prior approval for dividend distributions that exceed the greater of the net income from operations which excludes net realized investment gains for the previous year determined under statutory accounting principles or 10 of statutory capital and surplus as of the previous yearend In addition the Nebraska insurance department must approve service arrangements and other transactions within the affiliated group of companies After the Japan branch conversion the Nebraska insurance department and the FSA approved their respective domiciled insurance company service arrangements and transactions The FSA does not allow dividends or other payments from Aflac Japan unless it meets certain financial criteria as governed by Japanese corporate law Under these criteria dividend capacity at the Japan subsidiary will be defined as retained earnings plus other capital reserve less net aftertax net unrealized losses on availableforsale securities The ability of Aflac and Aflac Japan to pay dividends or make other payments to the Parent Company could also be constrained by the Companys dependency on financial strength ratings from independent rating agencies The Companys ratings from these agencies depend to a large extent on Aflacs capitalization level Any inability of Aflac to pay 27 Item 1A Risk Factors dividends or make other payments to the Parent Company could have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition and results of operations For the foregoing reasons there is no assurance that the earnings from or other available assets of the Parent Companys operating subsidiaries will be sufficient to make distributions to enable the Company to operate Any decrease in the Companys financial strength or debt ratings may have an adverse effect on its competitive position and access to liquidity and capital Financial strength ratings can play an important role in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies On an ongoing basis NRSROs review the financial performance and condition of many insurers including Aflac and its competitors They may assign multiple ratings including a financial strength rating reflecting their view of the insurers ability to pay claims on a timely basis and ratings on an insurers senior and subordinated debt obligations indicating their view of an insurers ability to make timely payments on their debt obligations NRSROs may change their ratings or outlook on an insurers ratings due to a variety of factors including the NRSROs assessment of the insurers strength of operations and overall financial condition Some factors that may influence ratings include competitive position profitability cash generation and other sources of liquidity capital levels quality of the investment portfolio and perception of management capabilities The ratings assigned to Aflac by the NRSROs are important factors in the Companys ability to access liquidity and capital from the bank market debt capital markets or other available sources such as reinsurance transactions Downgrades to Aflacs credit ratings could give its derivative counterparties the right to require early termination of derivatives transactions or delivery of additional collateral thereby adversely affecting the Companys liquidity In view of the difficulties experienced after the financial crisis by many financial institutions including those in the insurance industry the NRSROs have heightened the level of scrutiny that they apply to such institutions Steps taken by the NRSROs include an increase in the frequency and scope of their reviews additional information requests from the companies that they rate including additional information regarding the valuation of investment securities held and in certain cases an increase in the capital and other requirements employed in their models for maintenance of certain rating levels On September 16 2015 SP downgraded their credit rating of Japans sovereign debt Following this action they also downgraded several other foreign insurers including Aflac Although Aflac is a USbased insurer Aflacs significant operations in Japan and corresponding regulation by the Japanese FSA combined with its significant exposure to JGBs as outlined above resulted in SP downgrading the financial strength rating of Aflacs core insurance operations to A and its senior debt rating to A both with a stable outlook While SP made no further downgrades to Aflacs ratings between 2016 and 2018 they have stated in the past that a downgrade of Japans sovereign rating could lead to a downgrade of Aflacs financial strength rating As a matter of policy SP rarely rates insurance companies above the sovereign longterm rating of the country of domicile because during times of stress the sovereigns regulatory and supervisory powers may restrict an insurers or financial systems flexibility In addition to the impact on Aflacs access to liquidity as mentioned above a downgrade of Aflacs ratings could have a material adverse effect on agent recruiting and retention sales competitiveness and the marketability of its products which could negatively impact Aflacs liquidity operating results and financial condition Additionally sales through the bank channel in Japan could be adversely affected as a result of their reliance and sensitivity to ratings levels The Company cannot predict what actions rating agencies may take or what actions the Company may take in response to the actions of rating agencies which could adversely affect Aflacs business As with other companies in the financial services industry Aflacs ratings could be downgraded at any time and without any notice by any NRSRO  28 Item 1A Risk Factors The Companys risk management policies and procedures may prove to be ineffective and leave the Company exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risk which could adversely affect the Companys businesses or result in losses The Company has developed an enterprisewide risk management and governance framework to mitigate risk and loss to the Company The Company maintains policies procedures and controls intended to identify measure monitor report and analyze the risks to which the Company is exposed However there are inherent limitations to risk management strategies because risk may exist or emerge in the future that the Company has not appropriately anticipated or identified If the Companys risk management framework proves ineffective the Company may suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected As the Companys businesses change and the markets in which it operates evolve the Companys risk management framework may not evolve at the same pace as those changes As a result there is a risk that new products or new business strategies may present risks that are not appropriately identified monitored or managed In times of market stress unanticipated market movements or unanticipated claims experience resulting from greater than expected morbidity mortality longevity or persistency the effectiveness of the Companys risk management strategies may be limited resulting in losses to the Company In addition under difficult or less liquid market conditions the Companys risk management strategies may not be effective because other market participants may be using the same or similar strategies to manage risk under the same challenging market conditions In such circumstances it may be difficult or more expensive for the Company to mitigate risk due to the activity of such other market participants Many of the Companys risk management strategies or techniques are based upon historical customer and market behavior and all such strategies and techniques are based to some degree on managements subjective judgment The Company cannot provide assurance that its risk management framework including the underlying assumptions or strategies will be accurate and effective Management of operational legal and regulatory risks requires among other things policies procedures and controls to record properly and verify a large number of transactions and events and these policies procedures and controls may not be fully effective Models are utilized by the Companys businesses and corporate areas primarily to project future cash flows associated with pricing products calculating reserves and valuing assets as well as in evaluating risk and determining capital requirements among other uses These models are utilized under a risk management policy approved by the Companys executive risk management committees however the models may not operate properly and rely on assumptions and projections that are inherently uncertain As the Companys businesses continue to grow and evolve the number and complexity of models the Company utilizes expands increasing the Companys exposure to error in the design implementation or use of models including the associated input data and assumptions Past or future misconduct by the Companys employees or employees of the Companys third parties suppliers which are costbased relationships and alliance partners which are revenuegenerating relationships could result in violations of law by the Company regulatory sanctions andor serious reputational or financial harm and the precautions the Company takes to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases Despite the Companys published Supplier Code of Conduct due diligence of the Companys alliance partners and rigorous contracting procedures including financial legal IT security and risk reviews there can be no assurance that controls and procedures that the Company employs which are designed to assess third party viability and prevent the Company from taking excessive or inappropriate risks will be effective Additionally the use of third parties also poses operational risks that could result in financial loss operational disruption brand damage or compliance issues Inadequate oversight of Aflacs third party suppliers due to the lack of policies procedures training and governance may lead to financial loss or damage to the Aflac brand The concentration of the Companys investment portfolios in any particular singleissuer or sector of the economy may have an adverse effect on the Companys financial position or results of operations Negative events or developments affecting any particular single issuer industry group of related industries asset class or geographic sector may have an adverse impact on a particular holding or set of holdings which may increase risk of loss from defaults due to nonpayment of interest or principal The Company seeks to minimize this risk by maintaining an appropriate level of diversification To the extent the Company has concentrated positions it could have an adverse effect on the Companys results of operations and financial position The Companys global investment guidelines establish concentration limits for its investment portfolios 29 Item 1A Risk Factors For details on the concentrations within the Companys investment portfolios see the Analysis of Financial Condition section of Item 7 MDA and the Credit Risk section of Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk of this Form 10K The valuation of the Companys investments and derivatives includes methodologies estimations and assumptions which are subject to differing interpretations and could result in changes to investment valuations that may adversely affect the Companys results of operations or financial condition The Company reports a significant amount of its fixed maturity securities and other financial instruments at fair value As such valuations may include inputs and assumptions that are less observable or require greater estimation as well as valuation methods which are more sophisticated thereby resulting in values which may be greater or less than the value at which the investments may be ultimately sold Rapidly changing and unprecedented credit and equity market conditions could materially impact the valuation of securities as reported within the Companys consolidated financial statements and the periodtoperiod changes in value could vary significantly Valuations of the Companys derivatives fluctuate with changes in underlying market variables such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates During periods of market turbulence created by political instability economic uncertainty government interventions or other factors the Company may experience significant changes in the volatility of its derivative valuations Extreme market conditions can also affect the liquidity of such instruments creating marked differences in transaction levels and counterparty valuations Depending on the severity and direction of the movements in its derivative valuations the Company will face increases in the amount of collateral required to be posted with its counterparties Liquidity stresses to the Company may also occur if the required collateral amounts increase significantly over a very short period of time Conversely the Company may be exposed to an increase in counterparty credit risk for short periods of time while calling collateral from its counterparties Elimination of LIBOR as an interest rate benchmark may create uncertainty in valuation of loans derivatives and other assets where valuation and interest rates are based on LIBOR and may create uncertainty in the pricing of such assets in markets for their sale and disposition For further discussion on investment and derivative valuations see the Critical Accounting Estimates section in Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis and Notes 1 3 4 and 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10K Managing key executive succession is critical to the Companys success The Company would be adversely affected if it fails to adequately plan for succession of its senior management and other key executives While the Company has succession plans and employment arrangements with certain key executives these plans cannot guarantee that the services of these executives will be available to the Company and its operations could be adversely affected if they are not Catastrophic events could adversely affect the Companys financial condition and results of operations as well as the availability of the Companys infrastructure and systems The Companys insurance operations are exposed to the risk of catastrophic events including but not necessarily limited to epidemics pandemics tornadoes hurricanes earthquakes tsunamis war or other military action and terrorism or other acts of violence The extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event Certain events such as earthquakes tsunamis hurricanes and manmade catastrophes could cause substantial damage or loss of life in larger areas especially those that are heavily populated Claims resulting from natural or manmade catastrophic events could cause substantial volatility in the Companys financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and could materially reduce its profitability or harm the Companys financial condition as well as affect its ability to write new business Additionally the Companys business operations may be adversely affected by such catastrophic events to the extent they disrupt the Companys physical infrastructure and systems that support its businesses and customers Although the Company has a global crisis management framework to minimize the business disruption from a catastrophic event such framework may not be effective to avoid an adverse impact to the Company from such an event 30 Item 1A Risk Factors Changes in accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standard Boards FASB or other standardsetting bodies may adversely affect the Companys financial statements The Companys financial statements are subject to the application of US GAAP which is periodically revised andor expanded Accordingly from time to time the Company is required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies including the FASB The impact of accounting pronouncements that have been issued but not yet implemented and are applicable to the Company is disclosed in Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements The pronouncements expected to have the most significant impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations are outlined below In June 2016 the FASB issued ASU 201613 Financial Instruments  Credit Losses Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments  The amendments in this update require a financial asset or a group of financial assets measured on an amortized cost basis to be presented net of an allowance for credit losses in order to reflect the amount expected to be collected on the financial assets The Company currently expects loans and loan receivables and heldtomaturity fixed maturity securities to be the asset classes most significantly impacted upon adoption of the guidance The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15 2019 Additionally in August 2018 the FASB issued ASU 201812 Financial Services  Insurance Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for LongDuration Contracts  The amendments in this update will significantly change how insurers account for longduration contracts Among the issues addressed in the amendments is the requirement to review and if there is a change update assumptions for liability for future policy benefits at least annually and to update the discount rate assumption quarterly The frequency of the reviews and updates varies according to the assumptions but will be at least annually in all cases The Company anticipates that the requirement to review and update assumptions for liability for future policy benefits will have a significant impact on its results of operations systems processes and controls while the requirement to update the discount rate will have a significant impact on the other comprehensive income component of its equity The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15 2020 The accounting treatment that the Company applies to its consolidated financial statements will change due to new standards and could have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations and financial condition For information on new accounting pronouncements and the impact if any on the Companys financial position or results of operations see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report Changes in the Companys discount rate expected rate of return life expectancy health care cost and expected compensation increase assumptions for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans may result in increased expenses and reduce the Companys profitability The Company determines its pension and other postretirement benefit plan costs based on assumed discount rates expected rates of return on plan assets life expectancy of plan participants and expected increases in compensation levels and trends in health care costs Changes in these assumptions including from the impact of a sustained low interest rate environment may result in increased expenses and reduce the Companys profitability  The Company faces risks related to litigation regulatory investigations and inquiry and other matters The Company is a defendant in various lawsuits considered to be in the normal course of business The final results of any litigation cannot be predicted with certainty and plaintiffs may seek very large amounts in class actions or other litigation Although some of this litigation is pending in states where large punitive damages bearing little relation to the actual damages sustained by plaintiffs have been awarded in recent years the Company believes the outcome of pending litigation will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position results of operations or cash flows However a substantial legal liability or a significant federal state or other regulatory action against us as well as regulatory inquiries or investigations could harm our reputation result in changes in operations result in material fines or penalties result in significant costs due to legal fees settlements or judgments against the Company or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations Without limiting the foregoing the litigation and regulatory matters we are have been or may become subject to include matters related to sales agent recruiting policy sales practices claim payments and procedures including denial or delay of benefits material misstatements or omissions in our financial reports or other public statements andor

basis of race color national origin religion gender or other bases notwithstanding that our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics prohibits such harassment and discrimination by our employees we have ongoing training programs and provide opportunities to report claims of noncompliant conduct and 31 Item 1A Risk Factors we investigate and may take disciplinary action regarding alleged harassment or discrimination Any violations of or deviation from laws regulations internal or external codes or standards of normative behavior or perceptions of such violations or deviations by our employees or by independent sales agents could adversely impact the Companys reputation and brand value financial condition and results of operations Allegations or determinations of agent misclassification could adversely affect the Companys results of operations financial condition and liquidity A majority of our US sales force is and has historically been comprised of independent agents While we believe that we have properly classified such agents as independent contractors we may be subject to claims regulatory action by state or federal departments of labor or tax authorities or litigation asserting that such agents are employees The laws and regulations governing the classification of workers in the United States may be changed or interpreted differently compared to past interpretations including in states where the Company generates significant sales through independent agents An allegation or determination that independent agents in the Companys US sales force have been misclassified as independent contractors could result in changes in the Companys operations and US business model result in material fines or penalties result in significant costs due to legal fees settlements or judgments against the Company or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business results of operation financial condition and liquidity ITEM 1B UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

Company as nominal defendant and the Parent Companys Chairman and Chief Executive Officer several of its directors and a former officer and director as defendants The complaint alleges breaches of fiduciary duty misstatements and omissions in the Companys public disclosures and insider trading The Companys Board of Directors had previously established a special litigation committee SLC in July 2017 to investigate certain allegations underlying the derivative action The SLC issued a report of its investigation in September 2017 and another report in February 2018 each of which determined that it was not in the best interests of the Company to pursue the action demanded by the shareholders An amended complaint was filed on January 31 2018 On February 12 2018 this litigation was transferred to the US District Court for the Middle District of Georgia The SLC issued a third report of its investigation in May 2018 regarding certain additional allegations raised in the amended
