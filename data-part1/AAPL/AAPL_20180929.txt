customers are primarily in the consumer small and midsized business education enterprise and government markets The Company sells its products and resells thirdparty products in most of its major markets directly to consumers and small and midsized businesses through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force The Company also employs a variety of indirect distribution channels such as thirdparty cellular network carriers wholesalers retailers and resellers During 2018  the Companys net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 29 and 71 respectively of total net sales The Company believes that sales of its innovative and differentiated products and services are enhanced by knowledgeable salespersons who can convey the value of the hardware and software integration and demonstrate the unique solutions that are available on its products The Company further believes providing direct contact with its targeted customers is an effective way to demonstrate the advantages of its products over those of its competitors and providing a highquality sales and aftersales support experience is critical to attracting new and retaining existing customers To ensure a highquality buying experience for its products in which service and education are emphasized the Company continues to build and improve its distribution capabilities by expanding the number of its own retail stores worldwide The Companys retail stores are typically located at hightraffic locations in quality shopping malls and urban shopping districts By operating its own stores and locating them in desirable hightraffic locations the Company is better positioned to ensure a highquality customer buying experience and attract new customers The stores are designed to simplify and enhance the presentation and marketing of the Companys products and related solutions The retail stores employ experienced and knowledgeable personnel who provide product advice service and training and offer a wide selection of thirdparty hardware software and other accessories that complement the Companys products The Company has also invested in programs to enhance reseller sales by placing highquality Apple fixtures merchandising materials and other resources within selected thirdparty reseller locations Through the Apple Premium Reseller Program certain thirdparty resellers focus on the Apple platform by providing a high level of product expertise integration and support services The Company is committed to delivering solutions to help educators teach and students learn The Company believes effective integration of technology into classroom instruction can result in higher levels of student achievement and has designed a range of products services and programs to address the needs of education customers The Company also supports mobile learning and realtime distribution of and access to educationrelated materials through iTunes U   a platform that allows students and teachers to share and distribute educational media online The Company sells its products to the education market through its direct sales force select thirdparty resellers and its retail and online stores The Company also sells its hardware and software products to enterprise and government customers in each of its reportable segments The Companys products are deployed in these markets because of their performance productivity easeofuse and seamless integration into information technology environments The Companys products are compatible with thousands of thirdparty business applications and services and its tools enable the development and secure deployment of custom applications as well as remote device administration No single customer accounted for more than 10 of net sales in 2018  2017 and 2016  Competition The markets for the Companys products and services are highly competitive and the Company is confronted by aggressive competition in all areas of its business These markets are characterized by frequent product introductions and rapid technological advances that have substantially increased the capabilities and use of mobile communication and media devices personal computers and other digital electronic devices Many of the Companys competitors that sell mobile devices and personal computers based on other operating systems seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures The Companys financial condition and operating results can be adversely affected by these and other industrywide downward pressures on gross margins Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price product and service features including security features relative price and performance product and service quality and reliability design innovation a strong thirdparty software and accessories ecosystem marketing and distribution capability service and support and corporate reputation The Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to personal computers and mobile communication and media devices These markets are highly competitive and include many large wellfunded and experienced participants The Company expects competition in these markets to intensify significantly as competitors attempt to imitate some of the features of the Companys products and applications within their own products or alternatively collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer These markets are characterized by aggressive price competition frequent product introductions evolving design approaches and technologies rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses Apple Inc  2018 Form 10K  4 The Companys services also face substantial competition including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases The Company competes with business models that provide content to users for free The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain thirdparty digital content and applications The Companys future financial condition and operating results depend on the Companys ability to continue to develop and offer new innovative products and services in each of the markets in which it competes The Company believes it offers superior innovation and integration of the entire solution including the hardware iOS devices Mac Apple Watch and Apple TV software iOS macOS watchOS and tvOS online services and distribution of digital content and applications Digital Content and Services Some of the Companys current and potential competitors have substantial resources and may be able to provide such products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss to compete with the Companys offerings Supply of Components Although most components essential to the Companys business are generally available from multiple sources certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources In addition the Company competes for various components with other participants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices and personal computers Therefore many components used by the Company including those that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industrywide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that could materially adversely affect the Companys financial condition and operating results The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source When a component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased If the Companys supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the Company the Companys financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected The Companys business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Companys requirements The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components however there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms or at all Therefore the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results Substantially all of the Companys hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia with some Mac computers manufactured in the US and Ireland A significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners often in single locations Certain of these outsourcing partners are singlesourced suppliers of components and manufacturers for many of the Companys products Although the Company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules the Companys financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production commitments The Companys manufacturing purchase obligations typically cover its requirements for periods up to 150 days  Research and Development Because the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances the Companys ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products services and technologies to the marketplace The Company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and services and to expand the range of its offerings through RD licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of thirdparty businesses and technology Intellectual Property The Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices accessories software and services This includes patents copyrights trademarks service marks trade dress and other forms of intellectual property rights in the US and a number of foreign countries Although the Company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel Apple Inc  2018 Form 10K  5 The Company regularly files patent applications to protect innovations arising from its research development and design and is currently pursuing thousands of patent applications around the world Over time the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued patents including utility patents design patents and others The Company also holds copyrights relating to certain aspects of its products and services No single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Companys products The Company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products Many of the Companys products are designed to include intellectual property obtained from third parties It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of the Companys products processes and services While the Company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all Because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company competes current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents it is possible that certain components of the Companys products processes and services may unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others From time to time the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties Foreign and Domestic Operations and Geographic Data During 2018 the Companys domestic and international net sales accounted for 37 and 63  respectively of total net sales Gross margins on the Companys products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers can be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations including duties tariffs and antidumping penalties Business Seasonality and Product Introductions The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand Additionally new product introductions can significantly impact net sales product costs and operating expenses Product introductions can also impact the Companys net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new product inventory following a product introduction and channel inventory of a particular product often declines as the next related major product launch approaches Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction However neither historical seasonal patterns nor historical patterns of product introductions should be considered reliable indicators of the Companys future pattern of product introductions future net sales or financial performance Warranty The Company offers a limited parts and labor warranty on its hardware products The basic warranty period is typically one year from the date of purchase by the original end user The Company also offers a 90day limited warranty on the service parts used to repair the Companys hardware products In certain jurisdictions local law requires that manufacturers guarantee their products for a period prescribed by statute typically at least two years In addition where available consumers may purchase APP or AC which extends service coverage on many of the Companys hardware products Backlog In the Companys experience the actual amount of product backlog at any particular time is not a meaningful indication of its future business prospects In particular backlog often increases immediately following new product introductions as customers anticipate shortages Backlog is often reduced once customers believe they can obtain sufficient supply Because of the foregoing backlog should not be considered a reliable indicator of the Companys ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance Employees As of September 29 2018  the Company had approximately 132000 fulltime equivalent employees Apple Inc  2018 Form 10K  6 Available Information The Companys

be important to understanding other statements in this Form 10K The following information should be read in conjunction with Part II Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part II Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10K The business financial condition and operating results of the Company can be affected by a number of factors whether currently known or unknown including but not limited to those described below any one or more of which could directly or indirectly cause the Companys actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from past or from anticipated future financial condition and operating results Any of these factors in whole or in part could materially and adversely affect the Companys business financial condition operating results and stock price Because of the following factors as well as other factors affecting the Companys financial condition and operating results past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods Global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the Companys business results of operations financial condition and growth  The Company has international operations with sales outside the US representing a majority of the Companys total net sales In addition a majority of the Companys supply chain and its manufacturing and assembly activities are located outside the US As a result the Companys operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions Adverse macroeconomic conditions including inflation slower growth or recession new or increased tariffs changes to fiscal and monetary policy tighter credit higher interest rates high unemployment and currency fluctuations could materially adversely affect demand for the Companys products and services In addition consumer confidence and spending could be adversely affected in response to financial market volatility negative financial news conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets declines in income or asset values changes to fuel and other energy costs labor and healthcare costs and other economic factors In addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Companys products uncertainty about or a decline in global or regional economic conditions could have a significant impact on the Companys suppliers contract manufacturers logistics providers distributors cellular network carriers and other channel partners Potential effects include financial instability inability to obtain credit to finance operations and purchases of the Companys products and insolvency A downturn in the economic environment could also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Companys trade receivables the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions limitations on the Companys ability to issue new debt reduced liquidity and declines in the fair value of the Companys financial instruments These and other economic factors could materially adversely affect the Companys business results of operations financial condition and growth Global markets for the Companys products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets The Companys products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins frequent introduction of new products and services short product life cycles evolving industry standards continual improvement in product priceperformance characteristics rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses The Companys ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products services and technologies to the marketplace The Company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products including the hardware operating system numerous software applications and related services As a result the Company must make significant investments in RD There can be no assurance that these investments will achieve expected returns and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully The Company currently holds a significant number of patents and copyrights and has registered and applied to register numerous patents trademarks and service marks In contrast many of the Companys competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures and emulating the Companys products and infringing on its intellectual property If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the Companys intellectual property the Companys ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be adversely affected Apple Inc  2018 Form 10K  8 The Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone tablet and personal computer markets The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical marketing distribution and other resources as well as established hardware software and digital content supplier relationships In addition some of the Companys competitors have broader product lines lowerpriced products and a larger installed base of active devices Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins Certain competitors may have the resources experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss Additionally the Company faces significant competition as competitors attempt to imitate the Companys product features and applications within their own products or alternatively collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the Companys approach to providing components seamlessly within their individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions Some of the markets in which the Company competes including the market for personal computers have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted In addition an increasing number of internetenabled devices that include software applications and are smaller simpler and cheaper than traditional personal computers compete with some of the Companys existing products The Companys services also face substantial competition including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases The Company competes with business models that provide content to users for free The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain thirdparty digital content and applications The Companys financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the Companys ability to continually improve its products and services in order to maintain their functional and design advantages There can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively To remain competitive and stimulate customer demand the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and services Due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the Company competes the Company must continually introduce new products services and technologies enhance existing products and services effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services The success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors including but not limited to timely and successful development market acceptance the Companys ability to manage the risks associated with new product production rampup issues the availability of application software for new products the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies Accordingly the Company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product and service introductions and transitions The Company depends on the performance of carriers wholesalers retailers and other resellers The Company distributes its products through cellular network carriers wholesalers retailers and resellers many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers The Company also sells its products and thirdparty products in most of its major markets directly to education enterprise and government customers and consumers and small and midsized businesses through its retail and online stores Some carriers providing cellular network service for iPhone offer financing installment payment plans or subsidies for users purchases of the device There is no assurance that such offers will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the Companys agreements with these carriers or in agreements the Company enters into with new carriers The Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales including staffing selected resellers stores with Company employees and contractors and improving product placement displays These programs could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue The financial condition of these resellers could weaken these resellers could stop distributing the Companys products or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the Companys products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Companys products Apple Inc  2018 Form 10K  9 The Company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk The Company records a writedown for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or for which cost exceeds net realizable value The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components The Company reviews longlived assets including capital assets held at its suppliers facilities and inventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred it records a writedown equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value Although the Company believes its inventory capital assets inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable no assurance can be given that the Company will not incur writedowns fees impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes The Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments Manufacturing purchase obligations cover the Companys forecasted component and manufacturing requirements typically for periods up to 150 days  Because the Companys markets are volatile competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments Future operating results depend upon the Companys ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms Because the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks Many components including those that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industrywide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that could materially adversely affect the Companys financial condition and operating results While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms or at all Component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry further limiting the Companys ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms The effects of global or regional economic conditions on the Companys suppliers described in  Global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the Companys business results of operations financial condition and growth  above also could affect the Companys ability to obtain components  Therefore the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results The Companys new products often utilize custom components available from only one source When a component or product uses new technologies initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices or at all may be affected for any number of reasons including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Companys requirements If the Companys supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the Company the Companys financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected The Companys business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source The Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners many of which are located outside of the US Substantially all of the Companys manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia A significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners often in single locations The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management While these arrangements may lower operating costs they also reduce the Companys direct control over production and distribution Such diminished control may have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products or services or the Companys flexibility to respond to changing conditions Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement the Company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect or warranty liability While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct material violations of the supplier code of conduct could occur The Company relies on singlesourced outsourcing partners in the US Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many components and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia for final assembly of substantially all of the Companys hardware products Any failure of these partners to perform may have a negative impact on the Companys cost or supply of components or finished goods In addition manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations may be disrupted for a variety of reasons including but not limited to natural and manmade disasters information technology system failures commercial disputes military actions economic business labor environmental public health or political issues or international trade disputes Apple Inc  2018 Form 10K  10 The Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with longterm supply agreements While these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business such continued supply could be reduced or terminated and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments could be negatively impacted The Companys products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the Companys business and result in harm to the Companys reputation The Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects Sophisticated operating system software and applications such as those offered by the Company often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products Defects may also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties Component defects could make the Companys products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury These risks may increase as the Companys products are introduced into specialized applications including healthcare In addition the Companys service offerings may have quality issues and from time to time experience outages service slowdowns or errors As a result the Companys services may not perform as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware software and services it offers Failure to do so could result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the Companys products and services In addition the Company may be exposed to product liability claims recalls product replacements or modifications writeoffs of inventory property plant and equipment andor intangible assets and significant warranty and other expenses including litigation costs and regulatory fines Quality problems could also adversely affect the experience for users of the Companys products and services and result in harm to the Companys reputation loss of competitive advantage poor market acceptance reduced demand for products and services delay in new product and services introductions and lost revenue The Company relies on access to thirdparty digital content which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all The Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers This includes the right to sell currently available music movies TV shows and books The licensing or other distribution arrangements with these third parties are for relatively short terms and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on reasonable terms if at all Some thirdparty content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content in the future Other content owners providers or distributors may seek to limit the Companys access to or increase the cost of such content The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules or continue to expand its geographic reach Failure to obtain the right to make thirdparty digital content available or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse impact on the Companys financial condition and operating results Some thirdparty digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions If requirements change the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions There is no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner In addition certain countries have passed or may propose and adopt legislation that would force the Company to license its digital rights management which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could negatively affect arrangements with the Companys content providers The Companys future performance depends in part on support from thirdparty software developers The Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of thirdparty software applications and services There is no assurance that thirdparty developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the Companys products If thirdparty software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Companys products customers may choose not to buy the Companys products The Company believes the availability of thirdparty software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the Companys products compared to competitors platforms such as Android for smartphones and tablets and Windows for personal computers This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products the anticipated revenue that may be generated expected future growth of product sales and the costs of developing such applications and services Apple Inc  2018 Form 10K  11 The Companys minority market share in the global smartphone tablet and personal computer markets could make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Companys products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors products with larger market share If developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms the availability and quality of applications for the Companys devices may suffer The Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products The Companys products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change and if thirdparty developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change thirdparty applications might not take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences or might not operate correctly and may result in dissatisfied customers The Company sells and delivers thirdparty applications for its products through the App Store Mac App Store and TV App Store The Company retains a commission from sales through these platforms If developers reduce their use of these platforms to distribute their applications and offer inapp purchases to customers then the volume of sales and the commission that the Company earns on those sales would decrease The Company relies on access to thirdparty intellectual property which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all Many of the Companys products include thirdparty intellectual property which requires licenses from those third parties Based on past experience and industry practice the Company believes such licenses generally can be obtained on reasonable terms There is however no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or at all Failure to obtain the right to use thirdparty intellectual property or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms could preclude the Company from selling certain products or services or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Companys financial condition and operating results The Company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings such as being found to have infringed on intellectual property rights  The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved and new claims may arise in the future In addition agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions which may subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party Claims against the Company based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights have generally increased over time and may continue to increase In particular the Company has historically faced a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellularenabled products and new claims may arise in the future For example technology and other patentholding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights The Company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in a number of US jurisdictions and before the US International Trade Commission as well as internationally in various countries The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages Regardless of the merit of particular claims litigation may be expensive time consuming disruptive to the Companys operations and distracting to management In recognition of these considerations the Company may enter into licensing agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such disputes No assurance can be given that such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur These agreements may also significantly increase the Companys operating expenses Except as described in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 9 Commitments and Contingencies under the heading Contingencies in the opinion of management there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims including matters related to infringement of intellectual property rights The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts in excess of managements expectations the Companys financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected Further such an outcome could result in significant compensatory punitive or trebled monetary damages disgorgement of revenue or profits remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise Apple Inc  2018 Form 10K  12 The Company is subject to laws and regulations worldwide changes to which could increase the Companys costs and individually or in the aggregate adversely affect the Companys business The Company is subject to laws and regulations affecting its domestic and international operations in a number of areas These US and foreign laws and regulations affect the Companys activities in areas including but not limited to labor advertising digital content consumer protection real estate billing ecommerce promotions quality of services telecommunications mobile communications and media television intellectual property ownership and infringement tax import and export requirements anticorruption foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions data privacy and data localization requirements anticompetition environmental health and safety By way of example laws and regulations related to mobile communications and media devices in the many jurisdictions in which the Company operates are extensive and subject to change Such changes could include among others restrictions on the production manufacture distribution and use of devices locking devices to a carriers network or mandating the use of devices on more than one carriers network These devices are also subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies as well as by cellular network carriers for use on their networks These certification processes are extensive and time consuming and could result in additional testing requirements product modifications or delays in product shipment dates or could preclude the Company from selling certain products Compliance with these laws regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive and they may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction further increasing the cost of compliance and doing business Any such costs which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation could individually or in the aggregate make the Companys products and services less attractive to the Companys customers delay the introduction of new products in one or more regions or cause the Company to change or limit its business practices The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations but there can be no assurance that the Companys employees contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Companys policies and procedures The Companys business is subject to the risks of international operations The Company derives a majority of its revenue and earnings from its international operations Compliance with applicable US and foreign laws and regulations such as import and export requirements anticorruption laws tax laws foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions data privacy and data localization requirements environmental laws labor laws and anticompetition regulations increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions Although the Company has implemented policies and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations a violation by the Companys employees contractors or agents could nevertheless occur In some cases compliance with the laws and regulations of one country could violate the laws and regulations of another country Violations of these laws and regulations could materially adversely affect the Companys brand international growth efforts and business The Company also could be significantly affected by other risks associated with international activities including but not limited to economic and labor conditions increased duties taxes and other costs political instability and international trade disputes Gross margins on the Companys products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by international trade regulations including duties tariffs and antidumping penalties The Company is also exposed to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables with customers in certain international markets There can be no assurance the Company can effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses The Companys retail stores have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties The Companys retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements information systems inventory and personnel The Company also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space Certain stores have been designed and built to serve as highprofile venues to promote brand awareness Because of their unique design elements locations and size these stores require substantially more investment than the Companys more typical retail stores Due to the high cost structure associated with the Companys retail stores a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs writeoffs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance costs The Companys retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact the Companys financial condition and operating results including macroeconomic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity Other factors include but are not limited to the Companys ability to manage costs associated with retail store construction and operation manage relationships with existing retail partners manage costs associated with fluctuations in the value of retail inventory and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost Apple Inc  2018 Form 10K  13 Investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Companys ongoing business and present risks not originally contemplated The Company has invested and in the future may invest in new business strategies or acquisitions Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties including distraction of management from current operations greater than expected liabilities and expenses inadequate return of capital and unidentified issues not discovered in the Companys due diligence These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful The Companys business and reputation may be impacted by information technology system failures or network disruptions The Company may be subject to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters accidents power disruptions telecommunications failures acts of terrorism or war computer viruses physical or electronic breakins or other events or disruptions System redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate and the Companys business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities Such failures or disruptions could adversely impact the Companys business by among other things preventing access to the Companys online services interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the Companys products These events could materially adversely affect the Companys reputation financial condition and operating results There may be losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information including personally identifiable information that could subject the Company to significant reputational financial legal and operational consequences The Companys business requires it to use and store confidential information including among other things personally identifiable information PII with respect to the Companys customers and employees The Company devotes significant resources to network and data security including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data But these measures cannot provide absolute security and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the Companys reputation financial condition and operating results The Companys business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties Although the Company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to third parties such measures are not always effective and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the Companys reputation financial condition and operating results For example the Company may experience a security breach impacting the Companys information technology systems that compromises the confidentiality integrity or availability of confidential information Such an incident could among other things impair the Companys ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services impact the Companys stock price materially damage supplier relationships and expose the Company to litigation or government investigations which could result in penalties fines or judgments against the Company Although malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information including PII affect many companies across various industries the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates owns manages stores and processes The Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies As with all companies these security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking employee error malfeasance system error faulty password management or other irregularities For example third parties attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names passwords or other sensitive information which may in turn be used to access the Companys information technology systems To help protect customers and the Company the Company monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances which among other things may result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the Companys products and services In addition to the risks relating to general confidential information described above the Company may also be subject to specific obligations relating to health data and payment card data Health data may be subject to additional privacy security and breach notification requirements and the Company may be subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the Companys compliance with these obligations If the Company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements or if health data is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the Companys agreements with healthcare institutions the Company could be subject to litigation or government investigations may be liable for associated investigatory expenses and could also incur significant fees or fines Apple Inc  2018 Form 10K  14 Under payment card rules and obligations if cardholder information is potentially compromised the Company could be liable for associated investigatory expenses and could also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards The Company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards which would materially adversely affect the Companys reputation financial condition and operating results While the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise The Companys business is subject to a variety of US and international laws rules policies and other obligations regarding data protection The Company is subject to federal state and international laws relating to the collection use retention security and transfer of PII In many cases these laws apply not only to thirdparty transactions but also may restrict transfers of PII among the Company and its international subsidiaries Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction Complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the Company to incur substantial costs or require the Company to change its business practices Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability The Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of PII through its privacy policy information provided on its website and press statements Any failure by the Company to comply with these public statements or with other federal state or international privacyrelated or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others In addition to reputational impacts penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability The Companys success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key personnel Much of the Companys future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel including its Chief Executive Officer executive team and other highly skilled employees Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense especially in Silicon Valley where most of the Companys key personnel are located The Companys business may be impacted by political events international trade disputes war terrorism natural disasters public health issues industrial accidents and other business interruptions Political events international trade disputes war terrorism natural disasters public health issues industrial accidents and other business interruptions could harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers suppliers contract manufacturers logistics providers distributors cellular network carriers and other channel partners International trade disputes could result in tariffs and other protectionist measures that could adversely affect the Companys business Tariffs could increase the cost of the Companys products and the components and raw materials that go into making them These increased costs could adversely impact the gross margin that the Company earns on its products Tariffs could also make the Companys products more expensive for customers which could make the Companys products less competitive and reduce consumer demand Countries may also adopt other protectionist measures that could limit the Companys ability to offer its products and services Political uncertainty surrounding international trade disputes and protectionist measures could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending which could adversely affect the Companys business Many of the Companys operations and facilities as well as critical business operations of the Companys suppliers and contract manufacturers are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters In addition such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire power shortages nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents terrorist attacks and other hostile acts labor disputes public health issues and other events beyond the Companys control Global climate change could result in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects Such events could make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers create delays and inefficiencies in the Companys supply and manufacturing chain and result in slowdowns and outages to the Companys service offerings Following an interruption to its business the Company could require substantial recovery time experience significant expenditures in order to resume operations and lose significant revenue Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company Apple Inc  2018 Form 10K  15 The Companys operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers While the Companys suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations an industrial accident could occur and could result in disruption to the Companys business and harm to the Companys reputation Should major public health issues including pandemics arise the Company could be adversely affected by more stringent employee travel restrictions additional limitations in freight services governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions delays in production ramps of new products and disruptions in the operations of the Companys suppliers and contract manufacturers The Company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate The Companys profit margins vary across its products services geographic segments and distribution channels For example gross margins on the Companys hardware products vary across product lines and can change over time as a result of product transitions pricing and configuration changes and component warranty and other cost fluctuations The Companys financial results may be materially adversely impacted as a result of shifts in the mix of products and services that the Company sells shifts in the geographic currency or channel mix of the Companys sales component cost increases price competition or the introduction of new products including new products with higher cost structures The Company has typically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters due in part to seasonal holiday demand Additionally new product introductions can significantly impact net sales product costs and operating expenses Further the Company generates a majority of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments such as lowerthananticipated demand for the Companys products issues with new product introductions information technology system failures or network disruptions or failure of one of the Companys logistics components supply or manufacturing partners The Companys stock price is subject to volatility The Companys stock price has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future Additionally the Company the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies operating performance Price volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its own stock to exceed the stocks price at a given point in time The Company believes its stock price should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability The Company also believes its stock price should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Companys Board of Directors and the Companys share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth profitability dividends share repurchases or other market expectations its stock price may decline significantly which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention The Companys financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the US dollar relative to local currencies The Companys primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to nonUS dollardenominated sales and operating expenses worldwide Gross margins on the Companys products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations Weakening of foreign currencies relative to the US dollar adversely affects the US dollar value of the Companys foreign currencydenominated sales and earnings and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing potentially reducing demand for the Companys products In some circumstances for competitive or other reasons the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the US dollars strengthening which would adversely affect the US dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currencydenominated sales Conversely a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the US dollar while generally beneficial to the Companys foreign currencydenominated sales and earnings could cause the Company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments thereby limiting the benefit Additionally strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Companys cost of product components denominated in those currencies thus adversely affecting gross margins The Company uses derivative instruments such as foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place Apple Inc  2018 Form 10K  16 The Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of its investment portfolio The Companys investments can be negatively affected by liquidity credit deterioration financial results market and economic conditions political risk sovereign risk interest rate fluctuations or other factors As a result the value and liquidity of the Companys cash cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially Therefore although the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash cash equivalents and marketable securities future fluctuations in their value could result in significant realized losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Companys financial condition and operating results The Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable vendor nontrade receivables and prepayments related to longterm supply agreements and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen The Company distributes its products through thirdparty cellular network carriers wholesalers retailers and resellers The Company also sells its products directly to small and midsized businesses and education enterprise and government customers A substantial majority of the Companys outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral thirdparty bank support or financing arrangements or credit insurance The Companys exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited The Company also has unsecured vendor nontrade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company In addition the Company has made prepayments associated with longterm supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components As of September 29 2018  a significant portion of the Companys trade receivables was concentrated within cellular network carriers and its vendor nontrade receivables and prepayments related to longterm supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor nontrade receivables as well as longterm prepayments there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses The Company could be subject to changes in its tax rates the adoption of new US or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities The Company is subject to taxes in the US and numerous foreign jurisdictions including Ireland where a number of the Companys subsidiaries are organized Due to economic and political conditions tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change The Companys effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation including in the US and Ireland The Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the US Internal Revenue Service the IRS and other tax authorities and governmental bodies The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations If the Companys effective tax rates were to increase particularly in the US or Ireland or if the ultimate determination of the Companys taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued the Companys financial condition operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected Item 1B Unresolved Staff Comments None Apple Inc  2018 Form 10K  17 Item 2 Properties The Companys headquarters are located in Cupertino California As of September 29 2018  the Company owned 165 million square feet and leased 243 million square feet of building space primarily in the US Additionally the Company owned a total of 7376 acres of land primarily in the US As of September 29 2018  the Company owned facilities and land for corporate functions RD and data centers at various locations throughout the US Outside the US the Company owned additional facilities and land for various purposes The Company believes its existing facilities and equipment which are used by all reportable segments are in good operating condition and are suitable for the conduct of its business The Company has invested in internal capacity and strategic relationships with outside manufacturing vendors and continues to make investments in capital equipment as needed to meet anticipated demand for its products and services Item 3 Legal Proceedings The Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business Except as described in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 9 Commitments and Contingencies under the heading Contingencies in the opinion of management there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of managements expectations the Companys financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected Refer to the risk factor  The Company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings such as being found to have infringed on intellectual property rights  in Part I Item 1A of this Form 10K under the heading Risk Factors The Company settled certain matters during the fourth quarter of 2018 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Companys financial condition or operating results Item 4 Mine Safety Disclosures Not applicable
