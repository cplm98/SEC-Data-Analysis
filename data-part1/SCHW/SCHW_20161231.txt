advisory firms and trust companies  Across both segments t he Companys key competitive advantages are   Scale and Size of the Business  As one of the largest investment services firms in the United States US the Company is able to spread operating costs and amortize new investments over a large base of clients and has the resources to evolve capabilities to meet client needs  Operating Efficiency  Coupled with scale the Companys operating efficiency and sharing of infrastructure across different businesses creates a cost advantage that enables the Company to competitively price

challenge the status quo to benefit clients fosters innovation and continuous improvement which helps to attract more clients and assets  Sources of Net Revenues  The Companys major sources of net revenues are net interest revenue asset management and administration fees and trading revenue These revenue streams are supported by the Companys combination of bank brokerdealer and asset manage ment operating subsidiaries each of which brings specific capabilities that enable the Company to provide clients with the products and services they a re looking for  Net interest revenue is the difference between interest generated on interestearning assets and interest paid on funding sources the majority of which is derived from client cash balances held by the Company as part of the clients overall relationship with the Company While certain client cash balances are held on the brokerdealers balance sheet or swept to money market funds a substantial amount of existing cash balances and most new client cash inflows are swept to Schwab Bank which also offers clients checking and savings account capabilities Over time as supporting capital is available the Company has been directing a growing proportion of client cash sweep balances to Schwab Bank relative to those going to the brokerdealer or money market funds This shift has been effected through changes to default sweep options and the periodic bulk transfer of larger balances Schwab Bank provides these balances with access to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC insurance protection as allowed and provides the Company with greater flexibility in terms of options for investing the cash and administering the interest rate paid on client deposits  Optimizing the return on client sweep cash as part

federal banking agencies have adopted a number of implementing regulations and other regulatory reforms that are significant for CSC and Schwab Bank These regulations are highlighted below  Basel III Capital and Liquidity Framework  In 2013 the US Federal banking agencies adopted strengthened regulatory capital requirements for US banking organizations consistent with Basel III Final Regulatory Capital Rules The Final Regulatory Capital Rules established Common Equity Tier 1 CET1 Capital as a new capital standard increased minimum required riskbased capital ratios narrowed the eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments provided for new regulatory capital deductions and adjustments and modified methods for calculating riskweighted assets the denominator of riskbased capital ratios See Capital Management in Part II Item 7  and Item 8  Note 22 for more information on capital requirements  The Final Regulatory Capital Rules provided for a onetime election which CSC and Schwab Bank made to exclude accumulated other comprehensive income AOCI from the calculation of all capital ratios  The Final Regulatory Capital Rules also introduced a capital conservation buffer that limits a banking organizations ability to make capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers if a banking organization fails to maintain a capital conservation buffer of more than 25 on a fully phasedin basis in excess of all of its minimum riskbased capital ratio requirements  The Final Regulatory Capital Rules provide for a standardized approach framework for the calculation of a banking organizations regulatory capital and riskweighted assets Depository institutions and their holding companies with consolidated total assets of 250 billion or more or total onbalancesheet foreign exposures of 10 billion or more are also required to calculate their regulatory capital and riskweighted assets using an advanced approaches framework and must satisfy the minimum capital ratios under both approaches Such companies must also maintain a minimum supplementary leverage ratio of at least 30 and are subject to certain other enhanced provisions CSC and Schwab Bank are currently only subject to the standardized approach framework   6  THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION The new capital requirements under the Final Regulatory Capital Rules became effective in 2015 for CSC which had not previously been subject to any consolidated capital requirements and Schwab Bank  In 2014 US Federal banking agencies adopted an interagency rule that imposes a quantitative Liquidity C overage R atio  LCR  requirement on large banking organizations Banking organizations with 250 billion or more in total consolidated assets or foreign exposures of 10 billion or more must hold High Quality Liquid Assets  HQLA  in an amount equal to at least 100 of their projected net cash outflows over the 30day period Other bank and savings and loan holding companies with total consolidated assets of 50 billion or more such as CSC are subject to a modified LCR rule requiring them to hold HQLA in an amount equal to at least 70 of their projected net cash outflows over the 30day period The modified LCR rule went into effect on January 1 2016 with holding companies subject to the rule required to hold at least 90 of the necessary amount of HQLA in 2016 and at least 100 starting on January 1 2017  Capital Stress Testing  In 2012 the OCC issued final rules implementing provisions of DoddFrank that require national banks and federal savings associations with total consolidated assets of more than 10 billion to conduct annual companyrun stress tests Under the DoddFrank Act Stress Test DFAST rules Schwab Bank must conduct annual stress tests using certain scenarios and prescribed stresstesting methodologies report the results to the OCC and the Federal Reserve and publish a summary of the results of its stress tests In July 2016 Schwab Bank submitted its companyrun stress test results to the OCC In October 2016 Schwab Bank publicly disclosed a summary of its stress test results under the severely adverse scenario prescribed by the OCC based upon a ninequarter timeframe beginning on January 1 2016 and ending on March 31 2018 In its summary Schwab Bank reported that its 71 Tier 1 leverage ratio at the beginning of the forecast period declined to a low of 67 during the ninequarter forecast horizon and ended at 72  Under the Federal Reserves DFAST regulations CSC will be required to conduct its first stress test using financial statement data as of December 31 2016 report the results of that stress test to the Federal Reserve by April 5 2017 and publicly disclose a summary of its stress test results between June 15 and June 30 2017 CSC is not subject to the annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review CCAR process which requires certain financial institutions to submit annual capital plans to the Federal Reserve CSC has been taking steps to implement stress testing policies procedures systems and governance structures that are designed to be consistent with regulatory expectations for a firm of its size and complexity  Insured Depository Institution Resolution Plans  In 2011 and 2012 the FDIC issued rules requiring insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of 50 billion or more to submit to the FDIC periodic plans providing for their resolution by the FDIC in the event of failure resolution plans or socalled living wills under the receivership and liquidation provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act Under these rules Schwab Bank is required to file with the FDIC an annual resolution plan demonstrating how the bank could be resolved in an orderly and timely manner in the event of receivership such that the FDIC would be able to  ensure that the banks depositors receive access to their deposits within one business day maximize the net present value of the banks assets when disposed of and minimize losses incurred by the banks creditors  Consumer Financial Protection  In 2011 pursuant to DoddFrank the CFPB began operations and was given broad rulemaking supervisory and enforcement authority for a wide range of federal consumer protection laws relating to financial products As a federal savings bank with 10 billion or more in consolidated total assets Schwab Banks lending and deposittaking activities are subject to regulation supervision and examination by the CFPB The CFPB has adopted many consumer protection rules since its creation and has additional authority to issue orders guidance and policy statements conduct examinations and bring enforcement actions  Deposit Insurance Assessments  The FDICs Deposit Insurance Fund DIF provides insurance coverage for certain deposits generally up to 250000 per depositor per account ownership type and is funded by quarterly assessments on insured depository institutions In 2011 the FDIC established a riskbased deposit premium assessment system that for large insured depository institutions with at least 10 billion in total consolidated assets such as Schwab Bank uses a scorecard method based on a number of factors including the institutions regulatory ratings asset quality and brokered deposits The deposit insurance assessment base is calculated as average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity  7  THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION  The DoddFrank Act i raised the minimum reserve ratio for the DIF to 135 from the former minimum of 115 and ii required that the DIFs reserve ratio reach 135 by September 30 2020  In March 2016 the FDIC issued a final rule imposing a flatrate surcharge on the quarterly assessments of insured depository institutions with total assets of 10 billion or more to pay for the increase The surcharge went into effect on July 1 2016  at the same time as a scheduled reduction in the regular FDIC insurance As a result the Company is now subject to a 3 basis point regular assessment on its total assessment base down from 5 basis points and a new 45 basis point surcharge on the amount of its assessment base in excess of 10 billion  Community Reinvestment Act  The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 CRA requires Schwab Banks primary federal bank regulatory agency the OCC to assess the banks record in meeting the credit needs of the communities served by the bank including low and moderateincome neighborhoods and persons Institutions are assigned one of four ratings and the assessment is reviewed in connection with any acquisition merger or branch office application  Source of Strength  The DoddFrank Act codified the Federal Reserves longheld position that a depository institution holding company must serve as a source of financial strength for its subsidiary depository institutions the socalled source of strength doctrine In effect the holding company may be compelled to commit resources to support the subsidiary in the event the subsidiary is in financial distress  BrokerDealer and Investment Advisor Regulation  CSCs principal brokerdealers are Schwab and optionsXpress  Schwab is registered as a

legislation is ongoing and significant rulemaking and interpretations remain to be completed For example rules relating to a minimum net stable funding ratio NSFR  which will require financial institutions to have a stable funding structure over a oneyear horizon have been proposed but have not yet been finalized In addition the SEC was given discretion to adopt rules regarding standards of conduct for brokerdealers providing investment advice to retail clients but has not yet made any rule proposals The Company has incurred and will  10  THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION continue to incur significant additional costs and expend a significant amount of time as it develops and integrates appropriate systems and procedures to comply with the rulemaking and then monitors supports and refines those systems and procedures  Failure to meet capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines could affect the Companys financial condition  CSC together with Schwab Bank and its brokerdealer subsidiaries must meet certain capital and liquidity standards subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about the adequacy of the Companys capital and the Companys internal assessment of its capital needs The Uniform Net Capital Rule limits Schwabs ability to transfer capital to CSC and other affiliates New regulatory capital liquidity and stress testing requirements may limit or otherwise restrict how the Company utilizes its capital including paying dividends and stock repurchases and may require the Company to increase its capital andor liquidity or to limit its growth Failure by either CSC or Schwab Bank to meet its minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and additional discretionary actions by regulators that if undertaken could have a negative impact on the Company In addition failure by CSC or Schwab Bank to maintain a sufficient amount of capital to satisfy its capital conservation buffer requirements as phased in would result in restrictions on the Companys ability to make capital distributions and discretionary cash bonus payments to executive officers Any requirement that the Company increase its regulatory capital replace certain capital instruments which presently qualify as Tier 1 capital or increase regulatory capital ratios or liquidity could require the Company to liquidate assets deleverage or otherwise change its business andor investment plans which may adversely affect its financial results Issuing additional common stock would dilute the ownership of existing stockholders  With  223 billion in consolidated total assets at December 31 2016 the Company is currently only subject to the standardized approach framework of the Basel III capital and liquidity requirements When the Companys consolidated total assets equal or exceed 250 billion the Company will become subject to the advanced approaches framework including being subject to a supplementary leverage ratio the inclusion of AOCI in regulatory capital the unmodified LCR enhanced Basel III disclosures and a more complex calculation of risk weighted assets that includes an assessment of the impact of operational risk In addition federal banking agencies have broad discretion and could require CSC or Schwab Bank to hold higher levels of capital or increase liquidity above the applicable regulatory requirements  For a discussion of the Companys Liquidity and Capital Management see Risk Management and Capital Management in Part II Item 7 and Item 8  Note 22  Significant interest rate changes could affect the Companys profitability  The direction and level of interest rates are important factors in earnings A decline in interest rates may have a negative impact on the Companys net interest revenue A low interest rate environment may also have a negative impact on the Companys asset management and administration fee revenues if the Company has to waive a portion of its management fees for certain Schwabsponsored money market mutual funds in order to continue providing a positive return to clients  Overall the Company is positioned to benefit from a rising interest rate environment A rise in interest rates may cause the Companys funding costs to increase if market conditions or the competitive environment forces the Company to raise its interest rates to avoid losing deposits Higher funding costs without offsetting increases in yields on interestearning assets can reduce the Companys net interest revenue  For additional information on the Companys net interest revenue see Results of Operations and Risk Management in Part II Item 7  Security breaches of the Companys systems or those of its clients or third parties may subject the Company to significant liability and damage the Companys reputation  The Companys business involves the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential information about the Company and its clients Information security risks for financial institutions are increasing in part because of the use of the internet and mobile technologies to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime activists hackers and other external parties including foreign state actors The Companys systems and those of other financial institutions have been and are likely to continue to be the target of cyber attacks malicious code computer viruses  11  THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION and denial of service attacks that could result in unauthorized access misuse loss or destruction of data including confidential client information account takeovers unavailability of service or other events Despite the Companys efforts to ensure the integrity of its systems the Company may not be able to anticipate or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types especially because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched and because security attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources Data security breaches may also result from nontechnical means for example employee misconduct  Security breaches including breaches of the Companys security measures or those of the Companys thirdparty service providers or clients could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws and could subject the Company to significant liability or loss that may not be covered by insurance actions by the Companys regulators damage to the Companys reputation or a loss of confidence in the Companys security measures which could harm the Companys business The Company may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify its protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures  The Company also faces risk related to external fraud involving the compromise of clients personal electronic devices that can facilitate the unauthorized access to login and password information for their various online financial accounts including those at the Company Such risk has grown in recent years due to the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime and other external parties including foreign statesponsored parties For example these parties send fraudulent phishing emails to the Companys clients in order to misappropriate user names passwords or other personal information Losses reimbursed to clients under the Companys guarantee against unauthorized account activity could have a negative impact on the Companys business financial condition and results of operations  Technology and operational failures or errors could subject the Company to losses litigation and regulatory actions  The Company must process record and monitor a large number of transactions and its operations are highly dependent on the integrity of its technology systems and its ability to make timely enhancements and additions to its systems System interruptions errors or downtime can result from a variety of causes including changes in client use patterns technological failure changes to its systems linkages with thirdparty systems and power failures and can have a significant impact on the Companys business and operations The Companys systems are vulnerable to disruptions from human error execution errors errors in models such as those used for asset management capital planning and management risk management stress testing and compliance employee misconduct unauthorized trading external fraud computer viruses distributed denial of service attacks cyber attacks terrorist attacks natural disaster power outage capacity constraints software flaws events impacting key business partners and vendors and similar events For example the Company and other financial institutions have been the target of various denial of service attacks that have in certain circumstances made websites mobile applications and email unavailable for periods of time It could take an extended period of time to restore full functionality to the Companys technology or other operating systems in the event of an unforeseen occurrence which could affect the Companys ability to process and settle client transactions Moreover instances of fraud or other misconduct might also negatively impact the Companys reputation and client confidence in the Company in addition to any direct losses that might result from such instances Despite the Companys efforts to identify areas of risk oversee operational areas involving risk and implement policies and procedures designed to manage these risks there can be no assurance that the Company will not suffer unexpected losses reputational damage or regulatory action due to technology or other operational failures or errors including those of its vendors or other third parties  While the Company devotes substantial attention and resources to the reliability capacity and scalability of its systems extraordinary trading volumes could cause the Companys computer systems to operate at unacceptably slow speeds or even fail affecting the Companys ability to process client transactions and potentially resulting in some clients orders being executed at prices they did not anticipate Disruptions in service and slower system response times could result in substantial losses and decreased client satisfaction The Company is also dependent on the integrity and performance of securities exchanges clearing houses and other intermediaries to which client orders are routed for execution and settlement Systems failures and constraints and transaction errors at such intermediaries could result in delays and erroneous or unanticipated execution prices cause substantial losses for the Company and for its clients and subject the Company to claims from its clients for damages   12  THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION A significant decrease in the Companys liquidity could negatively affect the Companys business and financial management as well as reduce client confidence in the Company  Maintaining adequate liquidity is crucial to the business operations of the Company including margin lending mortgage lending and transaction settlement among other liquidity needs The Company meets its liquidity needs primarily through cash generated by client activity and operating earnings as well as cash provided by external financing Fluctuations in client cash or deposit balances as well as changes in regulatory treatment of client deposits or market conditions may affect the Companys ability to meet its liquidity needs A reduction in the Companys liquidity position could reduce client confidence in the Company which could result in the loss of client accounts or could cause the Company to fail to satisfy its liquidity requirements including the modified LCR In addition if the Companys brokerdealer or depository institution subsidiaries fail to meet regulatory capital guidelines regulators could limit the subsidiaries operations or their ability to upstream funds to CSC which could reduce CSCs liquidity and adversely affect its ability to repay debt and pay cash dividends In addition CSC may need to provide additional funding to such subsidiaries  Factors which may adversely affect the Companys liquidity position include Schwab having temporary liquidity demands due to timing differences between brokerage transaction settlements and the availability of segregated cash balances unanticipated outflows of company cash fluctuations in cash held in banking or brokerage client accounts a dramatic increase in the Companys client lending activities including margin mortgagerelated and personal lending increased capital requirements changes in regulatory guidance or interpretations other regulatory changes or a loss of market or client confidence in the Company  When cash generated by client activity and operating earnings is not sufficient for the Companys liquidity needs the Company may seek external financing During periods of disruptions in the credit and capital markets potential sources of external financing could be reduced and borrowing costs could increase Although CSC and Schwab maintain committed and uncommitted unsecured bank credit lines and CSC has a commercial paper issuance program as well as a universal shelf registration statement filed with the SEC which can be used to sell securities financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all due to market conditions or disruptions in the credit markets In addition a significant downgrade in the Companys credit ratings could increase its borrowing costs and limit its access to the capital markets  The Company may suffer significant losses from its credit exposures  The Companys businesses are subject to the risk that a client counterparty or issuer will fail to perform its contractual obligations or that the value of collateral held to secure obligations will prove to be inadequate While the Company has policies and procedures designed to manage this risk the policies and procedures may not be fully effective The Companys exposure mainly results from margin lending clients options trading futures activities securities lending mortgage lending pledged asset lending its role as a counterparty in financial contracts and investing activities and indirectly from the investing activities of certain of the proprietary funds the Company sponsors  When clients purchase securities on margin borrow on lines of credit collateralized by securities or trade options or futures the Company is subject to the risk that clients may default on their obligations when the value of the securities and cash in their accounts falls below the amount of clients indebtedness Abrupt changes in securities valuations and the failure of clients to meet margin calls could result in substantial losses  The Company has exposure to credit risk associated with its investments Those investments are subject to price fluctuations as a result of changes in the financial markets assessment of credit quality Loss of value of securities can negatively affect earnings if management determines that such securities are other than temporarily impaired The evaluation of whether otherthantemporary impairment OTTI exists is a matter of judgment which includes the assessment of several factors If management determines that a security is OTTI  the cost basis of the security may be adjusted and a corresponding loss may be recognized in current earnings Deterioration in the performance of available for sale AFS and held to maturity HTM securities could result in the recognition of future impairment charges Even if a security is not considered OTTI  if the Company was ever forced to sell the security sooner than intended prior to maturity due to liquidity needs the Company would have to recognize any unrealized losses at that time See Critical Accounting Estimates in Part II Item 7 for additional information   13  THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION The Companys bank loans primarily consist of First Mortgages HELOCs and PALs Increases in delinquency and default rates housing and stock price declines increases in the unemployment rate and other economic factors can result in charges for loan loss reserves and write downs on such loans  Heightened credit exposures to specific counterparties or instruments concentration risk can increase the Companys risk of loss Examples of the Companys credit concentration risk include   Large positions in financial instruments collateralized by assets with similar economic characteristics or in securities of a single issuer or industry  Mortgage loans and HELOCs to banking clients which are secured by properties in the same geographic region and  Margin  pledged asset and securities lending activities collateralized by securities of a single issuer or industry  The Company sponsors a number of proprietary money market mutual funds and other proprietary funds Although the Company has no obligation to do so the Company may decide for competitive or other reasons to provide credit liquidity or other support to its funds in the event of significant declines in valuation of fund holdings or significant redemption activity that exceeds available liquidity Such support could cause the Company to take significant charges could reduce the Companys liquidity and in certain situations could with respect to proprietary funds other than money market mutual funds result in the Company having to consolidate a supported fund in its financial statements If the Company chose not to provide credit liquidity or other support in such a situation the Company could suffer reputational damage and its business could be adversely affected  The Company is subject to litigation and regulatory investigations and proceedings and may not be successful in defending itself against claims or proceedings  The financial services industry faces significant litigation and regulatory risks The Company is subject to claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of business including arbitrations class actions and other litigation some of which include claims for substantial or unspecified damages The Company is also the subject of inquiries investigations and proceedings by regulatory and other governmental agencies  Litigation and arbitration claims include those brought by the Companys clients and the clients of third party advisors whose assets are custodied at the Company Claims from clients of third party advisors may allege losses due to investment decisions made by the third party advisors or the advisors misconduct Litigation claims also include claims from third parties alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights eg patents Such litigation can require the expenditure of significant Company resources If the Company were found to have infringed on a thirdparty patent or other intellectual property rights it could incur substantial damages and in some circumstances could be enjoined from using certain technology or providing certain products or services  Actions brought against the Company may result in settlements awards injunctions fines penalties or other results adverse to the Company including reputational harm Even if the Company is successful in defending against these actions the defense of such matters may result in the Company incurring significant expenses A substantial judgment settlement fine or penalty could be material to the Companys operating results or cash flows for a particular future period depending on the Companys results for that period In market downturns the volume of legal claims and amount of damages sought in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial services companies have historically increased See Item 8  Note 14 for more information on contingencies  The Company relies on outsourced service providers to perform key functions  The Company relies on external service providers to perform certain key technology processing servicing and support functions These service providers face technology operating business and economic risks and any significant failures by them including the improper use or disclosure of the Companys confidential client employee or company information could cause the Company to incur losses and could harm the Companys reputation An interruption in or the cessation of service by any external service provider as a result of systems failures capacity constraints financial difficulties or for any other reason and the Companys inability to make alternative arrangements in a timely manner could disrupt the Companys operations impact the Companys ability to offer certain products and services and result in financial losses to the Company Switching to an alternative service provider may require a transition period and result in less efficient operations  14  THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION  Potential strategic transactions could have a negative impact on the Companys financial position  The Company evaluates potential strategic transactions including business combinations acquisitions and dispositions Any such transaction could have a material impact on the Companys financial position results of operations or cash flows The process of evaluating negotiating and effecting any such strategic transaction may divert managements attention from other business concerns and might cause the loss of key clients employees and business partners Moreover integrating businesses and systems may result in unforeseen expenditures as well as numerous risks and uncertainties including the need to integrate operational financial and management information systems and management controls integrate relationships with clients and business partners and manage facilities and employees in different geographic areas In addition an acquisition may cause the Company to assume liabilities or become subject to litigation or regulatory proceedings Further the Company may not realize the anticipated benefits from an acquisition and any future acquisition could be dilutive to the Companys current stockholders percentage ownership or to earnings per common share EPS   The Companys acquisitions and dispositions are typically subject to closing conditions including regulatory approvals and the absence of material adverse changes in the business operations or financial condition of the entity being acquired or sold To the extent the Company enters into an agreement to buy or sell an entity there can be no guarantee that the transaction will close when expected or at all If a material transaction does not close the Companys stock price could decline  The Companys industry is characterized by aggressive price competition   The Company continually monitors its pricing in relation to competitors and periodically adjusts trade commission rates interest rates on deposits and loans fees for advisory services expense ratios on mutual funds and ETFs and other pricing to enhance its competitive position Increased price competition from other financial services firms such as reduced commissions to attract trading volume or higher deposit rates to attract client cash balances could impact the Companys results of operations and financial condition  The Company faces competition in hiring and retaining qualified employees  The market for qualified personnel in the Companys business is highly competitive At various times different functions and roles are in especially high demand in the market  compelling the Company to pay more to attract talent The Companys ability to continue to compete effectively will depend upon its ability to attract new employees and retain existing employees while managing compensation costs  The Companys stock price has fluctuated historically and may continue to fluctuate  The Companys stock price can be volatile Among the factors that may affect the volatility of the Companys stock price are the following   The Companys exposure to changes in interest rates  Speculation in the investment community or the press about or actual changes in the Companys competitive position organizational structure executive team operations financial condition financial reporting and results expense discipline or strategic transactions  The announcement of new products services acquisitions or dispositions by the Company or its competitors and  Increases or decreases in revenue or earnings changes in earnings estimates by the investment community and variations between estimated financial results and actual financial results  Changes in the stock market generally or as it concerns the Companys industry as well as geopolitical corporate regulatory business and economic factors may also affect the Companys stock price  Future sales of CSCs equity securities may adversely affect the market price of CSCs common stock and result in dilution  CSCs certificate of incorporation authorizes CSCs Board of Directors among other things to issue additional shares of common or preferred stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into equity securities without stockholder approval  15  THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION CSC may issue additional equity or convertible securities to raise additional capital or for other purposes The issuance of any additional equity or convertible securities could be substantially dilutive to holders of CSCs common stock and may adversely affect the market price of CSCs common stock   Item 1B Unresolved Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Comments  None
