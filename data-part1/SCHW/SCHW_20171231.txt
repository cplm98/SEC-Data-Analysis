founded on the belief that all Americans deserve access to a better investing experience Although much has changed in the intervening years our purpose remains clear  to champion every clients goals with passion and integrity Guided by this purpose and the aspiration of creating the most trusted leader in investment services management has adopted a strategy described as Through Clients Eyes Under this approach our strategic goals are focused on putting clients perspectives needs and desires at the forefront Because investing plays a fundamental role in building financial security we

providing superior service We aim to offer a broad range of products and solutions to meet client needs with a focus on transparency and value In addition management works to couple Schwabs scale and resources with ongoing expense discipline to keep costs low and ensure that products and solutions are affordable as well as responsive to client needs Finally we seek to maximize our market valuation

and along with expense discipline generate earnings growth and build longterm stockholder value  1  THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Within Investor Services our competition in serving individual investors includes a wide range of brokerage wealth management and asset management firms as well as banks and trust companies In the Advisor Services arena we compete with institutional custodians traditional and discount brokers banks and investment advisory firms and trust companies Across both segments our key competitive advantages are  Scale and Size of the Business  As one of the largest investment services firms in the United States US we are able to spread operating costs amortize new investments over a large base of clients and have the resources to evolve capabilities to meet client needs  Operating Efficiency  Coupled with scale our operating efficiency and sharing of infrastructure across different businesses creates a cost advantage that enables us to competitively price products and services while profitably serving many different client channels  Operating Structure  Adding bank and asset management capabilities to the brokerdealers helps serve a wider array of client needs thereby deepening client relationships enhancing the stability of client assets and enabling diversified revenue streams  Brand and Corporate Reputation  In an industry dependent on trust Schwabs reputation and brand across multiple constituents enables us to attract clients and employees while credibly introducing new products to the market  Service Culture  Delivering a great client experience earns the trust and loyalty of clients and increases the likelihood that those clients will refer others  Willingness to Disrupt  Managements willingness to challenge the status quo to benefit clients fosters innovation and continuous improvement which helps to attract more clients and assets Sources of Net Revenues Our major sources of net revenues are net interest revenue asset management and administration fees and trading revenue These revenue streams are supported by the combination of bank brokerdealer and asset management operating subsidiaries each of which brings specific capabilities that enable us to provide clients with the products and services they are looking for Net interest revenue is the difference between interest generated on interestearning assets and interest paid on funding sources the majority of which is derived from client cash balances held by Schwab as part of the clients overall relationship with the Company While certain client cash balances are held on CSCos balance sheet or swept to our money market funds a substantial amount of existing cash balances and most new client cash inflows are swept to a banking subsidiary Over time as supporting capital has been available we have been directing a growing proportion of client cash sweep balances to a banking subsidiary relative to those going to the brokerdealer or money market funds This shift has been effected through changes to default sweep options and the periodic bulk transfer of larger balances Bank sweep balances have access to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC insurance protection as allowed and provide us with greater flexibility in terms of options for investing the cash and administering the interest rate paid The majority of asset management and administration fees are earned from proprietary money market mutual funds proprietary and thirdparty mutual funds and exchangetraded funds ETFs and feebased advisory solutions Trading revenue includes commissions earned for executing trades for clients in individual equities options futures fixed income securities and certain thirdparty mutual funds and ETFs as well as principal transaction revenue earned primarily from actions to support client trading in fixed income securities Products and Services We offer a broad range of products to address our clients varying investment and financial

organizations SROs We are also subject to oversight by regulatory bodies in other countries in which we operate These regulations affect our business operations and impose capital client protection and market conduct requirements As a result of the enactment of the DoddFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in 2010 DoddFrank the adoption of implementing regulations by the federal

areas of compliance risk management corporate governance operations capital and liquidity  5  THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Holding Company and Bank Regulation CSC is a savings and loan holding company and is regulated supervised and examined by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System Federal Reserve CSCs principal depository institution subsidiary Schwab Bank is a federal savings bank and is regulated supervised and examined by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency OCC the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau CFPB and the FDIC CSC and Schwab Bank are also subject to regulation and various requirements and restrictions under state and other federal laws This regulatory framework is designed to protect depositors and consumers the safety and soundness of depository institutions and their holding companies and the stability of the banking system as a whole This framework affects the activities and investments of CSC and its subsidiaries and gives the regulatory authorities broad discretion in connection with their supervisory examination and enforcement activities and policies Financial Regulatory Reform Following the enactment of DoddFrank the federal banking agencies have adopted a number of implementing regulations and other regulatory reforms that are significant for CSC and its banking subsidiaries These regulations are highlighted below Basel III Capital and Liquidity Framework Banking organizations are subject to the regulatory capital rules issued by the Federal Reserve and other US banking regulators including the OCC and the FDIC In addition to minimum riskbased capital requirements banking organizations must hold additional capital referred to as a capital conservation buffer to avoid being subject to limits on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers The regulatory capital rules provide for a standardized approach framework for the calculation of a banking organizations regulatory capital and riskweighted assets Depository institutions and their holding companies with consolidated total assets of 250 billion or more or total onbalancesheet foreign exposure of 10 billion or more are also required to calculate their regulatory capital and riskweighted assets using an advanced approaches framework and must satisfy the minimum capital requirements under both approaches Such companies must also maintain a minimum supplementary leverage ratio of at least 30 must include accumulated other comprehensive income AOCI in their calculation of their capital ratios and are subject to certain other enhanced provisions including additional reporting requirements CSC and its banking subsidiaries are currently only subject to the standardized approach framework but will become subject to the advanced approaches framework upon exceeding either of the thresholds The liquidity coverage ratio LCR rule requires banking organizations with consolidated total assets of 250 billion or more or total onbalancesheet foreign exposure of 10 billion or more and their depository institution subsidiaries with 10 billion or more in total consolidated assets to hold high quality liquid assets HQLA in an amount equal to at least 100 of their projected net cash outflows over the 30day period calculated on each business day Other bank and savings and loan holding companies with total consolidated assets of 50 billion or more are subject to a modified LCR rule requiring them to hold HQLA in an amount equal to at least 70 of their projected net cash outflows over the 30day period calculated as of the last business day of the month Capital Stress Testing Savings and loan holding companies and federal savings bank with total consolidated assets of more than 10 billion are required to conduct annual companyrun stress tests Under the DoddFrank Act Stress Test DFAST rules CSC for the first time in 2017 and Schwab Bank must conduct annual stress tests using certain scenarios and prescribed stresstesting methodologies report the results to the Federal Reserve and for Schwab Bank the OCC and publish summaries of the results of their stress tests As a savings and loan holding company CSC is not subject to the annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review CCAR process which requires certain financial institutions to submit annual capital plans to the Federal Reserve CSC continues to enhance its stress testing policies procedures systems and governance structures to be consistent with regulatory expectations for a firm of its size and complexity  6  THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Insured Depository Institution Resolution Plans The FDIC requires insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of 50 billion or more to submit to the FDIC periodic plans providing for their resolution by the FDIC in the event of failure resolution plans or socalled living wills under the receivership and liquidation provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act Schwab Bank is required to file with the FDIC an annual resolution plan demonstrating how the bank could be resolved in an orderly and timely manner in the event of receivership such that the FDIC would be able to ensure that the banks depositors receive access to their deposits within one business day maximize the net present value of the banks assets when disposed of and minimize losses incurred by the banks creditors Consumer Financial Protection The CFPB has broad rulemaking supervisory and enforcement authority for a wide range of federal consumer protection laws relating to financial products The CFPB has examination and primary enforcement authority over depository institutions with 10 billion or more in consolidated total assets Deposit Insurance Assessments The FDICs Deposit Insurance Fund DIF provides insurance coverage for certain deposits generally up to 250000 per depositor per account ownership type and is funded by quarterly assessments on insured depository institutions The FDIC uses a riskbased deposit premium assessment system that for large insured depository institutions with at least 10 billion in total consolidated assets uses a scorecard method based on a number of factors including the institutions regulatory ratings asset quality and brokered deposits The deposit insurance assessment base is calculated as average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity The DoddFrank Act i raised the minimum reserve ratio for the DIF to 135 from the former minimum of 115 and ii required that the DIFs reserve ratio reach 135 by September 30 2020 In July 2016 the FDIC imposed a flatrate quarterly surcharge on insured depository institutions with total assets of 10 billion or more and certain of their bank affiliates to pay for the increase The surcharge took effect at the same time as a scheduled reduction in the regular FDIC insurance As a result Schwabs banking subsidiaries are now subject to a 3 basis point regular assessment on their respective assessment bases down from 5 basis points and a new 45 basis point surcharge on the amount of their aggregate assessment base in excess of 10 billion that will remain in effect until the earlier of the DIF reaching 135 or December 31 2018 If DIF has not reached 135 by such date the FDIC will impose a shortfall assessment Community Reinvestment Act The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 CRA requires the primary federal bank regulatory agency for each of Schwabs depository institution subsidiaries to assess the subsidiarys record in meeting the credit needs of the communities served by the bank including low and moderateincome neighborhoods and persons Institutions are assigned one of four ratings outstanding satisfactory needs to improve or substantial noncompliance The failure of an institution to receive at least a satisfactory rating could inhibit the institution or its holding company from undertaking certain activities including acquisitions or opening branch offices Source of Strength The DoddFrank Act codified the Federal Reserves longheld position that a depository institution holding company must serve as a source of financial strength for its subsidiary depository institutions the socalled source of strength doctrine In effect the holding company may be compelled to commit resources to support the subsidiary in the event the subsidiary is in financial distress  7  THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION BrokerDealer and Investment Advisor Regulation Schwabs principal brokerdealer is CSCo

Rule specifies minimum capital requirements intended to ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of brokerdealers CSC itself is not a registered brokerdealer and it is not subject to the Uniform Net Capital Rule If CSCo fails to maintain specified levels of net capital such failure could constitute a default by CSC of certain debt covenants under its credit agreement The Uniform Net Capital Rule prohibits CSCo from paying cash dividends making unsecured advances or loans or repaying subordinated loans if such payment would result in a net capital amount of less than 5 of aggregate debit balances or less than 120 of its minimum dollar requirement of 250000 In addition to net capital requirements as a selfclearing brokerdealer CSCo is subject to cash deposit and collateral requirements with clearing houses such as the Depository Trust  Clearing Corporation and Options Clearing Corporation which may fluctuate significantly from time to time based upon the

We face a variety of risks that may affect our operations financial results or stock price and many of those risks are driven by factors that we cannot control or predict The following discussion addresses those risks that management believes are the most significant although there may be other risks that could arise or may prove to be more significant than expected that may affect our operations or financial results For a discussion of our risk management including operational risk compliance risk credit risk market risk and liquidity risk see Risk Management and Capital Management in Part II Item 7 Developments in the business economic and geopolitical environment could negatively impact our business Our business can be adversely affected by the general environment  economic corporate securities market regulatory and geopolitical developments all play a role in client asset valuations trading activity interest rates and overall investor engagement and are outside of our control Deterioration in the housing and credit markets reduction in shortterm interest rates and decreases in securities valuations negatively impact our results of operations and capital resources Extensive regulation of our businesses may subject us to significant penalties or limitations on business activities As a participant in the securities banking and financial services industries we are subject to extensive regulation under federal state and foreign laws by governmental agencies supervisory authorities and SROs The costs and uncertainty related to complying with such regulations continue to increase These regulations affect our business operations and impose capital client protection and market conduct requirements on us In addition to specific banking laws and regulations our banking regulators have broad discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies and could require CSC andor our banking subsidiaries to hold more capital increase liquidity or limit their ability to pay dividends or CSCs ability to repurchase or redeem shares The banking regulators could also limit our ability to grow including adding assets launching new products making acquisitions and undertaking strategic investments could limit our banking subsidiaries ability to accept deposits swept from client brokerage accounts and brokered deposits and could prevent us from pursuing our business strategy Despite our efforts to comply with applicable legal requirements there are a number of risks particularly in areas where applicable laws or regulations may be unclear or where regulators could revise their previous guidance Any enforcement actions or other proceedings brought by our regulators against us or our affiliates officers or employees could result in fines penalties cease and desist orders enforcement actions suspension disqualification or expulsion or other disciplinary sanctions including limitations on our business activities any of which could harm our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition While we maintain systems and procedures designed to ensure that we comply with applicable laws and regulations violations could occur In addition some legalregulatory frameworks provide for the imposition of fines or penalties for noncompliance even though the noncompliance was inadvertent or unintentional and even though systems and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violations were in place at the time There may be other negative consequences resulting from a finding of noncompliance including restrictions on certain activities Such a finding may also damage our reputation and our relationships with our regulators and could restrict the ability of institutional investment managers to invest in our securities  9  THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Legislation or changes in rules and regulations could negatively affect our business and financial results New legislation rules regulations and guidance or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing federal state foreign and SRO rules regulations and guidance including changes relating to mutual funds brokerdealer fiduciary duties and regulatory treatment of deposit accounts may directly affect the operation and profitability of Schwab or its specific business lines Our profitability could also be affected by rules and regulations that impact the business and financial communities generally including changes to the laws governing taxation electronic commerce client privacy and security of client data In addition the rules and regulations could result in limitations on the lines of business we conduct modifications to our business practices more stringent capital and liquidity requirements increased deposit insurance assessments or additional costs These changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make necessary changes to our compliance risk management treasury and operations functions Failure to meet capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines could affect our financial condition CSC together with its banking and brokerdealer subsidiaries must meet certain capital and liquidity standards subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about the adequacy of Schwabs capital and Schwabs internal assessment of its capital needs The Uniform Net Capital Rule limits CSCos ability to transfer capital to CSC and other affiliates New regulatory capital liquidity and stress testing requirements may limit or otherwise restrict how we utilize our capital including paying dividends stock repurchases and redemptions and may require us to increase our capital andor liquidity or to limit our growth Failure by either CSC or its banking subsidiaries to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and additional discretionary actions by regulators that if undertaken could have a negative impact on us In addition failure by CSC or our banking subsidiaries to maintain a sufficient amount of capital to satisfy their capital conservation buffer requirements as phased in would result in restrictions on our ability to make capital distributions and discretionary cash bonus payments to executive officers Any requirement that we increase our regulatory capital replace certain capital instruments which presently qualify as Tier 1 capital or increase regulatory capital ratios or liquidity could require us to liquidate assets deleverage or otherwise change our business andor investment plans which may adversely affect our financial results Issuing additional common stock would dilute the ownership of existing stockholders With 2433 billion in consolidated total assets at December 31 2017  we are currently only subject to the standardized approach capital framework of Basel III and modified liquidity requirements When our consolidated total assets equal or exceed 250 billion we will become subject to the advanced approaches framework including being subject to a supplementary leverage ratio the inclusion of AOCI in regulatory capital the unmodified LCR enhanced Basel III disclosures and a more complex calculation of risk weighted assets that includes an assessment of the impact of operational risk In addition federal banking agencies have broad discretion and could require CSC or its banking subsidiaries to hold higher levels of capital or increase liquidity above the applicable regulatory requirements Significant interest rate changes could affect our profitability The direction and level of interest rates are important factors in our earnings A decline in interest rates may have a negative impact on our net interest revenue A low interest rate environment may also have a negative impact on our asset management and administration fee revenues if we have to waive a portion of our management fees for certain Schwabsponsored money market mutual funds in order to continue providing a positive return to clients Overall we are positioned to benefit from a rising interest rate environment A rise in interest rates may cause our funding costs to increase if market conditions or the competitive environment forces us to raise our interest rates to avoid losing deposits Higher funding costs without offsetting increases in yields on interestearning assets can reduce our net interest revenue The manner in which interest rates are calculated could also impact our net interest revenue For example certain securities in Schwabs investment portfolios have floating interest rates based on benchmarks like the onemonth LIBOR which has been the subject of recent regulatory guidance and proposals for reform These reforms may cause LIBOR to perform differently than in the past or be replaced as a benchmark and could result in lower interest payments and a reduction in the value of the securities  10  THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION A significant change in client cash allocations could negatively impact our net interest revenue We rely heavily on bank deposits as a low cost source of funding to extend loans to clients and purchase investment securities Our bank deposits are primarily driven by our bank sweep feature uninvested cash balances in our client brokerage accounts are swept to our banking subsidiaries A significant reduction in our clients allocation to cash a change in the allocation of that cash or a transfer of cash away from the Company could reduce net interest revenue Security breaches of our systems or those of our clients or third parties may subject us to significant liability and damage Schwabs reputation Our business involves the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential information about our clients and us Information security risks for financial institutions are increasing in part because of the use of the internet and mobile technologies to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime activists hackers and other external parties including foreign state actors Our systems and those of other financial institutions have been and are likely to continue to be the target of cyber attacks malicious code computer viruses and denial of service attacks that could result in unauthorized access misuse loss or destruction of data including confidential client information account takeovers unavailability of service or other events Despite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems we may not be able to anticipate or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types especially because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched and because security attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources Data security breaches may also result from nontechnical means for example employee misconduct Given the high volume of transactions that we process the large number of clients counterparties and thirdparty service providers with which we do business and the increasing sophistication of cyber attacks a cyber attack could occur and persist for an extended period of time before being detected The extent of a particular cyber attack and the steps we may need to take to investigate the attack may not be immediately clear and it may take a significant amount of time before an investigation is completed and full and reliable information about the attack is known During such time we would not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated all or any of which would further increase the costs and consequences of a cyber attack Security breaches including breaches of our security measures or those of our thirdparty service providers or clients could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws and could subject us to significant liability or loss that may not be covered by insurance actions by our regulators damage to Schwabs reputation or a loss of confidence in our security measures which could harm our business We may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures We also face risk related to external fraud involving the misappropriation and use of clients user names passwords or other personal information to gain access to clients financial accounts at Schwab This could occur from the compromise of clients personal electronic devices or as a result of a data security breach at an unrelated company where clients personal information is taken and then made available to fraudsters Such risk has grown in recent years due to the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime and other external parties including foreign statesponsored parties Losses reimbursed to clients under our guarantee against unauthorized account activity could have a negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations Technology and operational failures or errors could subject us to losses litigation regulatory actions and reputational damage We must process record and monitor a large number of transactions and our operations are highly dependent on the integrity of our technology systems and our ability to make timely enhancements and additions to our systems System interruptions errors or downtime can result from a variety of causes including changes in client use patterns technological failure changes to our systems linkages with thirdparty systems and power failures and can have a significant impact on our business and operations Our systems are vulnerable to disruptions from human error execution errors errors in models such as those used for asset management capital planning and management risk management stress testing and compliance employee misconduct unauthorized trading external fraud computer viruses distributed denial of service attacks cyber attacks terrorist attacks natural disaster power outage capacity constraints software flaws events impacting key business partners and vendors and similar events For example Schwab and other financial institutions have been the  11  THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION target of various denial of service attacks that have in certain circumstances made websites mobile applications and email unavailable for periods of time It could take an extended period of time to restore full functionality to our technology or other operating systems in the event of an unforeseen occurrence which could affect our ability to process and settle client transactions Moreover instances of fraud or other misconduct might also negatively impact Schwabs reputation and client confidence in the Company in addition to any direct losses that might result from such instances Despite our efforts to identify areas of risk oversee operational areas involving risk and implement policies and procedures designed to manage these risks there can be no assurance that we will not suffer unexpected losses reputational damage or regulatory action due to technology or other operational failures or errors including those of our vendors or other third parties While we devote substantial attention and resources to the reliability capacity and scalability of our systems extraordinary trading volumes could cause our computer systems to operate at unacceptably slow speeds or even fail affecting our ability to process client transactions and potentially resulting in some clients orders being executed at prices they did not anticipate Disruptions in service and slower system response times could result in substantial losses and decreased client satisfaction We are also dependent on the integrity and performance of securities exchanges clearing houses and other intermediaries to which client orders are routed for execution and settlement System failures and constraints and transaction errors at such intermediaries could result in delays and erroneous or unanticipated execution prices cause substantial losses for us and for our clients and subject us to claims from our clients for damages A significant decrease in our liquidity could negatively affect our business and financial management as well as reduce client confidence in Schwab Maintaining adequate liquidity is crucial to our business operations including margin lending mortgage lending and transaction settlement among other liquidity needs We meet our liquidity needs primarily through cash generated by client activity and operating earnings as well as cash provided by external financing Fluctuations in client cash or deposit balances as well as changes in regulatory treatment of client deposits or market conditions may affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs A reduction in our liquidity position could reduce client confidence in Schwab which could result in the loss of client accounts or could cause us to fail to satisfy our liquidity requirements including the modified LCR In addition if our brokerdealer or depository institution subsidiaries fail to meet regulatory capital guidelines regulators could limit the subsidiaries operations or their ability to upstream funds to CSC which could reduce CSCs liquidity and adversely affect its ability to repay debt and pay cash dividends In addition CSC may need to provide additional funding to such subsidiaries Factors which may adversely affect our liquidity position include CSCo having temporary liquidity demands due to timing differences between brokerage transaction settlements and the availability of segregated cash balances unanticipated outflows of company cash fluctuations in cash held in banking or brokerage client accounts a dramatic increase in our client lending activities including margin mortgagerelated and personal lending increased capital requirements changes in regulatory guidance or interpretations other regulatory changes or a loss of market or client confidence in Schwab When cash generated by client activity and operating earnings is not sufficient for our liquidity needs we may seek external financing During periods of disruptions in the credit and capital markets potential sources of external financing could be reduced and borrowing costs could increase Although CSC and CSCo maintain committed and uncommitted unsecured bank credit lines and CSC has a commercial paper issuance program as well as a universal shelf registration statement filed with the SEC which can be used to sell securities financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all due to market conditions or disruptions in the credit markets In addition a significant downgrade in the Companys credit ratings could increase its borrowing costs and limit its access to the capital markets We may suffer significant losses from our credit exposures Our businesses are subject to the risk that a client counterparty or issuer will fail to perform its contractual obligations or that the value of collateral held to secure obligations will prove to be inadequate While we have policies and procedures designed to manage this risk the policies and procedures may not be fully effective Our exposure mainly results from margin lending clients options trading futures activities securities lending mortgage lending pledged asset lending our role as a counterparty in financial contracts and investing activities and indirectly from the investing activities of certain of the proprietary funds we sponsor When clients purchase securities on margin borrow on lines of credit collateralized by securities or trade options or futures we are subject to the risk that clients may default on their obligations when the value of the securities and cash in their  12  THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION accounts falls below the amount of clients indebtedness Abrupt changes in securities valuations and the failure of clients to meet margin calls could result in substantial losses We have exposure to credit risk associated with our investments Those investments are subject to price fluctuations as a result of changes in the financial markets assessment of credit quality Loss of value of securities can negatively affect earnings if management determines that such securities are other than temporarily impaired The evaluation of whether otherthantemporary impairment OTTI exists is a matter of judgment which includes the assessment of several factors If management determines that a security is OTTI the cost basis of the security may be adjusted and a corresponding loss may be recognized in current earnings Deterioration in the performance of available for sale AFS and held to maturity HTM securities could result in the recognition of future impairment charges Even if a security is not considered OTTI if we were ever forced to sell the security sooner than intended prior to maturity due to liquidity needs we would have to recognize any unrealized losses at that time Our bank loans primarily consist of First Mortgages HELOCs and PALs Increases in delinquency and default rates housing and stock price declines increases in the unemployment rate and other economic factors can result in charges for loan loss reserves and write downs on such loans Heightened credit exposures to specific counterparties or instruments can increase our risk of loss Examples include  Large positions in financial instruments collateralized by assets with similar economic characteristics or in securities of a single issuer or industry  Mortgage loans and HELOCs to banking clients which are secured by properties in the same geographic region and  Client margins options or futures pledged assets and securities lending activities collateralized by or linked to securities of a single issuer index or industry We sponsor a number of proprietary money market mutual funds and other proprietary funds Although we have no obligation to do so we may decide for competitive or other reasons to provide credit liquidity or other support to our funds in the event of significant declines in valuation of fund holdings or significant redemption activity that exceeds available liquidity Such support could cause us to take significant charges could reduce our liquidity and in certain situations could with respect to proprietary funds other than money market mutual funds result in us having to consolidate a supported fund in our financial statements If we chose not to provide credit liquidity or other support in such a situation Schwab could suffer reputational damage and its business could be adversely affected We are subject to litigation and regulatory investigations and proceedings and may not be successful in defending against claims or proceedings The financial services industry faces significant litigation and regulatory risks We are subject to claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of business including arbitrations class actions and other litigation some of which include claims for substantial or unspecified damages We are also the subject of inquiries investigations and proceedings by regulatory and other governmental agencies Litigation and arbitration claims include those brought by our clients and the clients of third party advisors whose assets are custodied at Schwab Claims from clients of third party advisors may allege losses due to investment decisions made by the third party advisors or the advisors misconduct Litigation claims also include claims from third parties alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights eg patents Such litigation can require the expenditure of significant company resources If we were found to have infringed on a thirdparty patent or other intellectual property rights we could incur substantial damages and in some circumstances could be enjoined from using certain technology or providing certain products or services Actions brought against us may result in settlements awards injunctions fines penalties or other results adverse to us including reputational harm Even if we are successful in defending against these actions the defense of such matters may result in us incurring significant expenses A substantial judgment settlement fine or penalty could be material to our operating results or cash flows for a particular future period depending on our results for that period In market downturns the volume of legal claims and amount of damages sought in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial services companies have historically increased  13  THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION We rely on outsourced service providers to perform key functions We rely on external service providers to perform certain key technology processing servicing and support functions These service providers face technology operating business and economic risks and any significant failures by them including the improper use or disclosure of our confidential client employee or company information could cause us to incur losses and could harm Schwabs reputation An interruption in or the cessation of service by any external service provider as a result of systems failures capacity constraints financial difficulties or for any other reason and our inability to make alternative arrangements in a timely manner could disrupt our operations impact our ability to offer certain products and services and result in financial losses to us Switching to an alternative service provider may require a transition period and result in less efficient operations Potential strategic transactions could have a negative impact on our financial position We evaluate potential strategic transactions including business combinations acquisitions and dispositions Any such transaction could have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows The process of evaluating negotiating and effecting any such strategic transaction may divert managements attention from other business concerns and might cause the loss of key clients employees and business partners Moreover integrating businesses and systems may result in unforeseen expenditures as well as numerous risks and uncertainties including the need to integrate operational financial and management information systems and management controls integrate relationships with clients and business partners and manage facilities and employees in different geographic areas In addition an acquisition may cause us to assume liabilities or become subject to litigation or regulatory proceedings Further we may not realize the anticipated benefits from an acquisition and any future acquisition could be dilutive to our current stockholders percentage ownership or to earnings per common share EPS Our acquisitions and dispositions are typically subject to closing conditions including regulatory approvals and the absence of material adverse changes in the business operations or financial condition of the entity being acquired or sold To the extent we enter into an agreement to buy or sell an entity there can be no guarantee that the transaction will close when expected or at all If a material transaction does not close our stock price could decline Our industry is characterized by aggressive price competition We continually monitor our pricing in relation to competitors and periodically adjust trade commission rates interest rates on deposits and loans fees for advisory services expense ratios on mutual funds and ETFs and other pricing to enhance our competitive position Increased price competition from other financial services firms such as reduced commissions to attract trading volume higher deposit rates to attract client cash balances or reduced expense ratios to attract mutual fund or ETF investments could impact our results of operations and financial condition We face competition in hiring and retaining qualified employees The market for qualified personnel in our business is highly competitive At various times different functions and roles are in especially high demand in the market compelling us to pay more to attract talent Our ability to continue to compete effectively will depend upon our ability to attract new employees and retain existing employees while managing compensation costs Our stock price has fluctuated historically and may continue to fluctuate Our stock price can be volatile Among the factors that may affect the volatility of our stock price are the following  Our exposure to changes in interest rates  Speculation in the investment community or the press about or actual changes in our competitive position organizational structure executive team operations financial condition financial reporting and results expense discipline or strategic transactions  The announcement of new products services acquisitions or dispositions by us or our competitors and  Increases or decreases in revenue or earnings changes in earnings estimates by the investment community and variations between estimated financial results and actual financial results  14  THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Changes in the stock market generally or as it concerns our industry as well as geopolitical corporate regulatory business and economic factors may also affect our stock price Future sales of CSCs equity securities may adversely affect the market price of CSCs common stock and result in dilution CSCs certificate of incorporation authorizes CSCs Board of Directors among other things to issue additional shares of common or preferred stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into equity securities without stockholder approval CSC may issue additional equity or convertible securities to raise additional capital or for other purposes The issuance of any additional equity or convertible securities could be substantially dilutive to holders of CSCs common stock and may adversely affect the market price of CSCs common stock Item 1B Unresolved Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Comments None Item
