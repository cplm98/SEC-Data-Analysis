belief that all Americans deserve access to a better investing experience Although much has changed in the intervening years our purpose remains clear  to champion every clients goals with passion and integrity Guided by this purpose and our vision of creating the most trusted leader in investment services management has adopted a strategy described as Through Clients Eyes This strategy emphasizes placing clients perspectives needs and desires at the forefront Because investing plays a fundamental role in building financial security we strive to deliver a better investing experience for our clients  individual investors and the people and institutions who serve them  by disrupting longstanding industry practices on their behalf and providing superior service We also aim to offer a broad range of products and solutions to meet client needs with a focus on transparency value and trust In addition management works to couple Schwabs scale and resources with ongoing expense discipline to keep costs low and ensure that products and solutions are affordable as well as responsive to client needs In combination these are the key elements of our no tradeoffs approach to serving investors We believe that following this strategy is the best way to maximize our market valuation and stockholder returns over time Management estimates that investable wealth in the United States US consisting of assets in defined contribution retail wealth management and brokerage and registered investment advisor channels along with bank deposits currently exceeds 45 trillion which means the Companys 404 trillion in client assets leaves substantial opportunity for growth Our strategy is based on the principle that developing trusted relationships will translate into more assets from both new and existing clients ultimately driving more revenue and along with expense discipline and thoughtful capital management will generate earnings growth and build longterm stockholder value Within Investor Services our competition in serving individual investors spans brokerage wealth management and asset management firms as well as banks and trust companies In the Advisor Services arena we compete with institutional custodians traditional and discount brokers banks and trust companies Across both segments our key competitive advantages are  Scale and Size of the Business  As one of the largest investment services firms in the US we are able to spread operating costs and amortize new investments over a large base of clients and harness the resources to evolve capabilities to meet client needs  Operating Efficiency  Coupled with scale our operating efficiency and sharing of infrastructure across different businesses creates a cost advantage that enables us to competitively price products and services while profitably serving clients of various sizes across multiple channels  Operating Structure  Providing bank and asset management services to brokerdealer clients helps serve a wider array of needs thereby deepening relationships enhancing the stability of client assets and enabling diversified revenue streams  Brand and Corporate Reputation  In an industry dependent on trust Schwabs reputation and brand across multiple constituents enable us to attract clients and employees while credibly introducing new products to the market  Service Culture  Delivering a great client experience earns the trust and loyalty of clients and increases the likelihood that those clients will refer others  3  THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION  Willingness to Disrupt  Managements willingness to challenge the status quo including our own business practices to benefit clients fosters innovation and continuous improvement which helps to attract more clients and assets Sources of Net Revenues Our three largest sources of net revenues are net interest revenue asset management and administration fees and trading revenue These revenue streams are supported by the combination of bank brokerdealer and asset management operating subsidiaries each of which brings specific capabilities that enable us to provide clients with the products and services they are looking for Net interest revenue is the difference between interest generated on interestearning assets and interest paid on funding sources the majority of which is derived from client cash balances awaiting investment held by Schwab as part of clients overall relationship with the Company While certain of these client cash balances are held on CSCos balance sheet or swept to our money market funds a substantial amount of existing balances  and most new inflows of cash awaiting investment  are swept to our banking subsidiaries Interestearning assets are primarily comprised of highquality fixed income securities margin loans and bank loans The majority of asset management and administration fees are earned from proprietary money market mutual funds proprietary and thirdparty mutual funds and exchangetraded funds ETFs and feebased advisory solutions Trading revenue includes commissions earned for executing trades for clients in individual equities options futures fixed income securities and certain thirdparty mutual funds and ETFs as well as principal transaction revenue earned primarily from actions to support client trading in fixed income securities Effective October 7 2019 CSCo eliminated online trading commissions for US and Canadianlisted stocks and ETFs as well as the base charge on options These pricing reductions are consistent with our vision of making investing accessible to all Management believes they enhance both our value proposition and our competitive positioning and will contribute to longterm growth in total client assets and client accounts at

Regulatory Capital and Liquidity Framework Banking organizations are subject to the regulatory capital rules issued by the Federal Reserve and other US banking regulators including the OCC and the FDIC In addition to minimum riskbased capital requirements banking organizations  7  THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION must hold additional capital referred to as a capital conservation buffer to avoid being subject to limits on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers During 2019 depository institutions and their holding companies with consolidated total assets of 250 billion or more or total onbalancesheet foreign exposure of 10 billion or more were required to calculate their regulatory capital and riskweighted assets using both a standardized approach and an advanced approaches framework and to satisfy the minimum capital requirements under both approaches Such companies were also required to maintain a minimum supplementary leverage ratio of at least 30 include accumulated other comprehensive income AOCI in their calculation of their capital ratios were subject to an incremental capital buffer of up to 25 of common equity Tier 1 capital if imposed

FDIC all granted extensions and exemptions to CSC and its banking subsidiaries such that they would not be subject to the advanced approaches framework until June 30 2020 As a result of crossing the 250 billion threshold in 2018 CSC and its banking subsidiaries in 2019 became subject to all other advanced approaches requirements  the supplementary leverage ratio the inclusion of AOCI in the calculation of capital ratios and the countercyclical capital buffer The full liquidity coverage ratio LCR rule required banking organizations with consolidated total assets of 250 billion or more or

in an amount equal to at least 100 of their projected net cash outflows over a prospective 30calendarday period of acute liquidity stress calculated on each business day CSC became subject to the full LCR rule in the second quarter of 2019 but until the beginning of 2020 was only required to calculate and comply with its LCR requirement as of the last business day of each calendar month In October 2019 the Federal Reserve OCC and FDIC jointly adopted a final rule which became effective on December 31 2019 interagency regulatory capital and liquidity rules that revised the regulatory capital and liquidity requirements for large US banking organizations with 100 billion or more in total consolidated assets The rules established four riskbased categories for determining the regulatory capital and liquidity requirements applicable to these institutions based on their total assets crossjurisdictional activity weighted shortterm wholesale funding nonbank assets and offbalance sheet exposure CSC is subject to the requirements under Category III based on its total consolidated assets of between 250 billion and less than 700 billion and having less than 75 billion in crossjurisdictional activity Capital requirements for Category III banking organizations include the generally applicable riskbased capital and Tier 1 Leverage Ratio requirements the standardized approach framework the minimum 30 supplementary leverage ratio and the countercyclical capital buffer which is currently 0 Category III organizations are no longer subject to the advanced approaches regulatory capital framework and are permitted to opt out of including AOCI in their regulatory capital calculations CSC made this opt out election and commencing with the first quarter of 2020 now excludes AOCI from its regulatory capital As revised by the interagency regulatory capital and liquidity rules Category III banking organizations with less than 75 billion in weighted shortterm wholesale funding which includes CSC and their depository institution subsidiaries with 10 billion or more in total consolidated assets are subject to a reduced LCR rule requiring them to hold HQLA in an amount equal to at least 85 of their projected net cash outflows over a prospective 30calendarday period of acute liquidity stress calculated on each business day If an institutions weighted shortterm wholesale funding

Federal Reserve and CSB reported the results to the OCC Both published summaries of their stress test results In final enhanced prudential standards rules adopted concurrently in October 2019 with the

SCHWAB CORPORATION beginning in 2020 CSC will continue to be required to report the results of its stress testing to the Federal Reserve and publish a summary of its stress test results In accordance with the Economic Growth Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act enacted in May 2018 the OCC also adopted amendments to its companyrun stress testing rule in October 2019 increasing the minimum threshold for Federal savings associations to conduct stress tests from 10 billion to 250 billion in consolidated assets As a result CSB is currently not subject to any companyrun stress testing requirements In its enhanced prudential standards rules the Federal Reserve also made Category III savings and loan holding companies subject to an annual supervisory stress testing requirement in which the Federal Reserve conducts its own stress testing analysis to evaluate the ability of a holding company to absorb losses in specified economic and financial conditions over a ninequarter planning horizon using such analytical techniques as the agency determines are appropriate This supervisory stress testing requirement will go into effect for CSC beginning with the 2022 stress testing cycle To implement this requirement the Federal Reserve is also expanding the reporting requirements applicable to savings and loan holding companies commencing in the second quarter of 2020 The Federal Reserve has also indicated that in the future large savings and loan holding companies including CSC will become subject to an annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review CCAR process which requires submission of an annual capital plan to the Federal Reserve However to date the Federal Reserve has not yet proposed modifications to its existing capital planning requirements to extend them to savings and loan holding companies Additional Enhanced Prudential Standards In addition to the revisions to the capital stress testing regime discussed above the Federal Reserves enhanced prudential standards rules will also extend the applicability of certain additional enhanced prudential standards to large savings and loan holding companies with the specific requirements tailored based on the same fourcategory framework utilized in the interagency regulatory capital and liquidity rules These additional enhanced prudential standards which have been applicable to large US bank holding companies under section 165 of the DoddFrank Act include risk management and risk committee requirements liquidity risk management stress testing and buffer requirements and single counterparty credit limits CSC will be required to comply with the new risk management and risk committee requirements as well as the new liquidity riskmanagement stress testing and buffer

insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of 50 billion or more to submit to the FDIC periodic plans providing for their resolution by the FDIC in the event of failure resolution plans or socalled living wills under the receivership and liquidation provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act Under this requirement CSB has been required to file with the FDIC a periodic resolution plan demonstrating how the bank could be resolved in an orderly and timely manner in the event of receivership such that the FDIC would be able to ensure that the banks depositors receive access to their deposits within one business day maximize the net present value of the banks assets when disposed of and minimize losses incurred by the banks creditors In April 2019 the FDIC approved an advance notice of proposed rulemaking seeking comment on ways to tailor and improve its insured depository institution resolution plan rule At the same time the FDIC announced that it would delay

Insurance Fund DIF provides insurance coverage for certain deposits generally up to 250000 per depositor per account ownership type and is funded by quarterly assessments on insured depository institutions The FDIC uses a riskbased deposit premium assessment system that for large insured depository institutions with at least 10 billion in total consolidated assets uses a scorecard method based on a number of factors including the institutions regulatory  9  THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION ratings asset quality and brokered deposits The deposit insurance assessment base is calculated as average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity In July 2016 the FDIC imposed a flatrate quarterly surcharge on insured depository institutions with total assets of 10 billion or more and certain of their bank affiliates to pay for an increase to the DIF from 115 to 135 of the assessment base As a result Schwabs banking subsidiaries became subject to an additional 45 basis point surcharge on the amount of their aggregate assessment base in excess of 10 billion In the third quarter of 2018 the DIF ratio exceeded 135 and the FDIC eliminated the surcharge beginning in the fourth quarter of 2018 Community Reinvestment Act The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 CRA requires the primary federal bank regulatory agency for each of Schwabs depository institution subsidiaries to assess the subsidiarys record in meeting the credit needs of the communities served by the bank including low and moderateincome neighborhoods and persons Institutions are assigned one of four ratings outstanding satisfactory needs to improve or substantial noncompliance The failure of an institution to receive at least a satisfactory rating could inhibit the institution or its holding company from undertaking certain activities including acquisitions or opening branch offices On January 9 2020 the OCC and FDIC published their jointly proposed revisions to the regulations implementing the CRA

Islands and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico CSCo and CSIM are registered as investment advisors with the SEC Additionally CSCo is regulated by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission CFTC with respect to the commodity futures and trading activities it conducts as an introducing broker Much of the regulation of brokerdealers has been delegated to SROs CSCo is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority Inc FINRA the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board MSRB Nasdaq Stock Market and NYSE Arca In addition to the SEC the primary regulators of CSCo are FINRA and for municipal securities the MSRB The National Futures Association NFA is CSCos primary regulator for futures and commodities trading activities The principal purpose of regulating brokerdealers and investment advisors is the protection of clients and securities markets The regulations cover all aspects of the securities business including among other things sales and trading practices

conduct of directors officers and employees CSCo is subject to Rule 15c31 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 the Uniform Net Capital Rule and related SRO requirements The CFTC and NFA also impose net capital requirements The Uniform Net Capital Rule specifies minimum capital requirements intended to ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of brokerdealers CSC itself is not a registered brokerdealer and it is not subject to the Uniform Net Capital Rule If CSCo fails to maintain specified levels of net capital such failure could constitute a default by CSC of certain debt covenants under its credit agreement The Uniform Net Capital Rule prohibits CSCo from paying cash dividends making unsecured advances or loans or repaying subordinated loans if such payment would result in a net capital amount of less than 5 of aggregate debit balances or less than 120 of its minimum dollar requirement of 250000  10  THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION In addition to net capital requirements as a selfclearing brokerdealer CSCo is subject to cash deposit and collateral requirements with clearing houses such as the Depository Trust  Clearing Corporation and Options Clearing Corporation which may fluctuate significantly from time to time based upon the nature and size of clients trading activity and market volatility As a result of our operations in countries outside the US we are also subject to rules and regulations issued by certain foreign authorities including the Financial Conduct Authority FCA in the UK the Securities and Futures Commission SFC in Hong Kong the Monetary Authority of Singapore MAS in Singapore and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission ASIC in Australia Financial Services Regulation Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 and USA PATRIOT Act

variety of risks that may affect our operations financial results or stock price and many of those risks are driven by factors that we cannot control or predict The following discussion addresses those risks that management believes are the most significant although there may be other risks that could arise or may prove to be more significant than expected that may affect our operations or financial results We also face certain risks in connection with our proposed merger with TD Ameritrade as described above in Item 1 of this Form 10K We encourage you to consider the risks below under the caption Risks Related to the Proposed Merger with TD Ameritrade These risks and other risks associated with the proposed merger will be more fully discussed in the joint proxy statementprospectus that will be included in the registration statement on Form S4 that CSC will file with the SEC in connection with the merger For a discussion of our risk management governance and processes including operational risk compliance risk credit risk market risk and liquidity risk see Risk Management and Capital Management in Part II Item 7  11  THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Developments in the business economic and geopolitical environment could negatively impact our business Our business can be adversely affected by the general environment  economic corporate securities market regulatory and geopolitical developments all play a role in client asset valuations trading activity interest rates and overall investor engagement and are outside of our control Deterioration in the housing and credit markets reduction in shortterm interest rates and decreases in securities valuations negatively impact our results of operations and capital resources Extensive regulation of our businesses may subject us to significant penalties or limitations on business activities As a participant in the securities banking and financial services industries we are subject to extensive regulation under federal state and foreign laws by governmental agencies supervisory authorities and SROs The costs and uncertainty related to complying with such regulations continue to increase These regulations affect our business operations and impose capital client protection and market conduct requirements on us In addition to specific banking laws and regulations our banking regulators have broad discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies and could require CSC andor our banking subsidiaries to hold more capital increase liquidity or limit their ability to pay dividends or CSCs ability to repurchase or redeem shares The banking regulators could also limit our ability to grow including adding assets launching new products making acquisitions and undertaking strategic investments Other potential regulatory actions include limiting our banking subsidiaries ability to accept deposits swept from client brokerage accounts and brokered deposits and preventing us from pursuing our business strategy Despite our efforts to comply with applicable legal requirements there are a number of risks particularly in areas where applicable laws or regulations may be unclear or where regulators could revise their previous guidance Any enforcement actions or other proceedings brought by our regulators against us or our affiliates officers or employees could result in fines penalties cease and desist orders enforcement actions suspension disqualification or expulsion or other disciplinary sanctions including limitations on our business activities any of which could harm our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition While we maintain systems and procedures designed to ensure that we comply with applicable laws and regulations violations could occur In addition some legalregulatory frameworks provide for the imposition of fines or penalties for noncompliance even though the noncompliance was inadvertent or unintentional and even though systems and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violations were in place at the time There may be other negative consequences resulting from a finding of noncompliance including restrictions on certain activities Such a finding may also damage our reputation and our relationships with our regulators and could restrict the ability of institutional investment managers to invest in our securities Legislation or changes in rules and regulations could negatively affect our business and financial results New legislation rules regulations and guidance or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing federal state foreign and SRO rules regulations and guidance including changes relating to mutual funds brokerdealer fiduciary duties and regulatory treatment of deposit accounts may directly affect the operation and profitability of Schwab or its specific business lines Our profitability could also be affected by rules and regulations that impact the business and financial communities generally including changes to the laws governing taxation electronic commerce client privacy and security of client data In addition the rules and regulations could result in limitations on the lines of business we conduct modifications to our business practices more stringent capital and liquidity requirements increased deposit insurance assessments or additional costs and could limit our ability to return capital to stockholders These changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make necessary changes to our compliance risk management treasury and operations functions Failure to meet capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines could affect our financial condition CSC together with its banking and brokerdealer subsidiaries must meet certain capital and liquidity standards subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about the adequacy of Schwabs capital and Schwabs internal assessment of its capital needs The Uniform Net Capital Rule limits CSCos ability to transfer capital to CSC and other affiliates New regulatory capital liquidity and stress testing requirements may limit or otherwise restrict how we utilize our capital including paying dividends stock repurchases and redemptions and may require us to increase our capital andor liquidity or to limit our  12  THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION growth Failure by either CSC or its banking subsidiaries to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and additional discretionary actions by regulators that if undertaken could have a negative impact on us In addition failure by CSC or our banking subsidiaries to maintain a sufficient amount of capital to satisfy their capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer requirements would result in restrictions on our ability to make capital distributions and discretionary cash bonus payments to executive officers Any requirement that we increase our regulatory capital replace certain capital instruments which presently qualify as Tier 1 Capital or increase regulatory capital ratios or liquidity could require us to liquidate assets deleverage or otherwise change our business andor investment plans which may adversely affect our financial results Issuing additional common stock would dilute the ownership of existing stockholders Effective December 31 2019 CSC was assigned to Category III of the new tailored regulatory requirements The Federal Reserve indicated that large savings and loan holding companies including CSC will become subject to the CCAR process If CSC reaches 700 billion in total assets or 75 billion in crossjurisdictional activity CSC will become subject to more stringent Category II requirements including annual stress testing the advanced approaches framework the inability to opt out of including AOCI in regulatory capital calculations the full LCR rule and daily liquidity reporting CSC will also be subject to the full LCR rule and daily liquidity reporting if its weighted shortterm wholesale funding is 75 billion or more A significant change in client cash allocations could negatively impact our net interest revenue We rely heavily on bank deposits as a funding source to extend loans to clients and purchase investment securities Our bank deposits are primarily driven by our bank sweep feature when cash awaiting investment in our client brokerage accounts is swept to our banking subsidiaries A significant reduction in our clients allocation to cash a change in the allocation of that cash or a transfer of cash away from the Company could reduce net interest revenue Significant interest rate changes could affect our profitability The direction and level of interest rates are important factors in our earnings A decline in interest rates may have a negative impact on our net interest revenue A low interest rate environment may also have a negative impact on our asset management and administration fee revenues if we have to waive a portion of our management fees for certain Schwabsponsored money market mutual funds in order to continue providing a positive return to clients Although we believe we are positioned to benefit from a rising interest rate environment a rise in interest rates may cause our funding costs to increase if market conditions or the competitive environment induces us to raise our interest rates to avoid losing deposits or replace deposits with higher cost funding sources without offsetting increases in yields on interestearning assets can reduce our net interest revenue The expected phaseout of LIBOR could negatively impact our net interest revenue and require significant operational work Certain securities in our investment portfolio and the floating rate loans we offer reference LIBOR as the benchmark rate to determine the applicable interest rate or payment amount We also use LIBOR in many of our financial models such as those used for capital stress testing and to determine the dividend rates for certain of our series of preferred stock which begin to float in 2022 and later If LIBOR is discontinued after 2021 as expected there will be uncertainty or differences in the calculation of the applicable interest rate or payment amount depending on the terms of the governing instruments and there will be significant work required to transition to using the new benchmark rates and implement necessary changes to our systems and financial models This could result in different financial performance for previously booked transactions and may impact our existing transaction data products systems operations and pricing processes The calculation of interest rates under the replacement benchmarks could also impact our net interest revenue In addition LIBOR may perform differently during the phaseout period than in the past which could result in lower interest payments and a reduction in the value of certain securities in our investment portfolio Security breaches of our systems or those of our clients or third parties may subject us to significant liability and damage Schwabs reputation Our business involves the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential information about our clients and us Information security risks for financial institutions are increasing in part because of the use of the internet and mobile technologies to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime activists hackers and other external parties including foreign state actors Our systems and those of other financial institutions have  13  THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION been and are likely to continue to be the target of cyber attacks malicious code computer viruses and denial of service attacks that could result in unauthorized access misuse loss or destruction of data including confidential client information account takeovers unavailability of service or other events Despite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems we may not be able to anticipate or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types especially because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched and because security attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources Data security breaches may also result from nontechnical means for example employee misconduct Given the high volume of transactions that we process the large number of clients counterparties and thirdparty service providers with which we do business and the increasing sophistication of cyber attacks a cyber attack could occur and persist for an extended period of time before being detected The extent of a particular cyber attack and the steps we may need to take to investigate the attack may not be immediately clear and it may take a significant amount of time before an investigation is completed and full and reliable information about the attack is known During such time we would not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated all or any of which would further increase the costs and consequences of a cyber attack Security breaches including breaches of our security measures or those of our thirdparty service providers or clients could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws and could subject us to significant liability or loss that may not be covered by insurance actions by our regulators damage to Schwabs reputation or a loss of confidence in our security measures which could harm our business We may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures We also face risk related to external fraud involving the misappropriation and use of clients user names passwords or other personal information to gain access to clients financial accounts at Schwab This could occur from the compromise of clients personal electronic devices or as a result of a data security breach at an unrelated company where clients personal information is taken and then made available to fraudsters Such risk has grown in recent years due to the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime and other external parties including foreign statesponsored parties Losses reimbursed to clients under our guarantee against unauthorized account activity could have a negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations Technology and operational failures or errors could subject us to losses litigation regulatory actions and reputational damage We must process record and monitor a large number of transactions and our operations are highly dependent on the integrity of our technology systems and our ability to make timely enhancements and additions to our systems System interruptions errors or downtime can result from a variety of causes including changes in client use patterns technological failure changes to our systems linkages with thirdparty systems and power failures and can have a significant impact on our business and operations Our systems are vulnerable to disruptions from human error execution errors errors in models such as those used for asset management capital planning and management risk management stress testing and compliance employee misconduct unauthorized trading external fraud computer viruses distributed denial of service attacks cyber attacks terrorist attacks natural disaster power outage capacity constraints software flaws events impacting key business partners and vendors and similar events For example Schwab and other financial institutions have been the target of various denial of service attacks that have in certain circumstances made websites mobile applications and email unavailable for periods of time It could take an extended period of time to restore full functionality to our technology or other operating systems in the event of an unforeseen occurrence which could affect our ability to process and settle client transactions Moreover instances of fraud or other misconduct might also negatively impact Schwabs reputation and client confidence in the Company in addition to any direct losses that might result from such instances Despite our efforts to identify areas of risk oversee operational areas involving risk and implement policies and procedures designed to manage these risks there can be no assurance that we will not suffer unexpected losses reputational damage or regulatory action due to technology or other operational failures or errors including those of our vendors or other third parties While we devote substantial attention and resources to the reliability capacity and scalability of our systems extraordinary trading volumes could cause our computer systems to operate at unacceptably slow speeds or even fail affecting our ability to process client transactions and potentially resulting in some clients orders being executed at prices they did not anticipate Disruptions in service and slower system response times could result in substantial losses and decreased client satisfaction We are also dependent on the integrity and performance of securities exchanges clearing houses and other  14  THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION intermediaries to which client orders are routed for execution and settlement System failures and constraints and transaction errors at such intermediaries could result in delays and erroneous or unanticipated execution prices cause substantial losses for us and for our clients and subject us to claims from our clients for damages Our investment management operations may subject us to fiduciary or other legal liability for client losses Fund and trust management and administration are complex activities and include functions such as recordkeeping and accounting security pricing corporate actions compliance with investment restrictions daily net asset value computations account reconciliations and required distributions to fund shareholders Failure to properly perform operational tasks or the misrepresentation of our services and products could subject us to regulatory sanctions penalties or litigation and result in reputational damage liability to clients and the termination of investment management or administration agreements and the withdrawal of assets under our management In the management and administration of funds and client accounts we use quantitative models and other tools and resources to support investment decisions and processes including those related to risk assessment portfolio management trading and hedging activities and product valuations Errors in the design function or underlying assumptions used in these models and tools particularly if we fail to detect the errors over an extended period could subject us to claims of a breach of fiduciary duty and potentially large liabilities for makewhole payments litigation andor regulatory fines A significant decrease in our liquidity could negatively affect our business as well as reduce client confidence in Schwab Maintaining adequate liquidity is crucial to our business operations including transaction settlement custody requirements and lending commitments among other liquidity needs We meet our liquidity needs primarily from working capital and cash generated by client activity as well as external financing Fluctuations in client cash or deposit balances as well as market conditions or changes in regulatory treatment of client deposits may affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs A reduction in our liquidity position could reduce client confidence in Schwab which could result in the transfer of client assets and accounts or could cause us to fail to satisfy our liquidity requirements including the LCR In addition if our brokerdealer or depository institution subsidiaries fail to meet regulatory capital guidelines regulators could limit the subsidiaries operations or their ability to upstream funds to CSC which could reduce CSCs liquidity and adversely affect its ability to repay debt pay dividends on CSCs preferred stock or return capital to common stockholders In addition CSC may need to provide additional funding to such subsidiaries Factors which may adversely affect our liquidity position include CSCo having temporary liquidity demands due to timing differences between brokerage transaction settlements and the availability of segregated cash balances fluctuations in cash held in banking or brokerage client accounts a dramatic increase in our lending activities including margin mortgagerelated and personal lending increased capital requirements changes in regulatory guidance or interpretations other regulatory changes or a loss of market or client confidence in Schwab resulting in unanticipated withdrawals of client funds When available cash is not sufficient for our liquidity needs we may seek external financing During periods of disruptions in the credit and capital markets potential sources of external financing could be reduced and borrowing costs could increase Although CSC and CSCo maintain committed and uncommitted unsecured bank credit lines and CSC has a commercial paper issuance program as well as a universal shelf registration statement filed with the SEC which can be used to sell securities financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all due to market conditions or disruptions in the credit markets In addition a significant downgrade in the Companys credit ratings could increase its borrowing costs and limit its access to the capital markets We may suffer significant losses from our credit exposures Our businesses are subject to the risk that a client counterparty or issuer will fail to perform its contractual obligations or that the value of collateral held to secure obligations will prove to be inadequate While we have policies and procedures designed to manage this risk the policies and procedures may not be fully effective Our exposure mainly results from margin lending clients options and futures trading securities lending mortgage lending pledged asset lending our role as a counterparty in financial contracts and investing activities and indirectly from the investing activities of certain of the proprietary funds we sponsor  15  THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION When clients purchase securities on margin borrow on lines of credit collateralized by securities or trade options or futures we are subject to the risk that clients may default on their obligations when the value of the securities and cash in their accounts falls below the amount of clients indebtedness Abrupt changes in securities valuations and the failure of clients to meet margin calls could result in substantial losses We have exposure to credit risk associated with our investments Those investments are subject to price fluctuations Loss of value of securities can negatively affect earnings if management determines that such loss of value has resulted from a credit loss The evaluation of whether a credit loss exists is a matter of judgment which includes the assessment of multiple factors If management determines that a securitys decline in fair value is the result of a credit loss an allowance for credit losses on the security will be recorded and a corresponding loss will be recognized in current earnings Even if a decline in fair value of a security is not determined to have resulted from a credit loss if we were ever forced to sell the security sooner than intended prior to maturity due to liquidity needs we would have to recognize any unrealized losses at that time Our bank loans primarily consist of First Mortgages HELOCs and PALs Increases in delinquency and default rates housing and stock price declines increases in the unemployment rate and other economic factors can result in increases in allowances for credit losses and related credit loss expense as well as write downs on such loans On January 1 2020 the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update ASU 201613  Financial Instruments  Credit Losses Topic 326 Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments which requires estimation of expected lifetime credit losses rather than incurred losses only as was previously required For more information on this adoption see Part II  Item 8  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  Note 2 Heightened credit exposures to specific counterparties or instruments can increase our risk of loss Examples include  Large positions in financial instruments collateralized by assets with similar economic characteristics or in securities of a single issuer or industry  Mortgage loans and HELOCs to banking clients which are secured by properties in the same geographic region and  Client margins options or futures pledged assets and securities lending activities collateralized by or linked to securities of a single issuer index or industry We sponsor a number of proprietary money market mutual funds and other proprietary funds Although we have no obligation to do so we may decide for competitive or other reasons to provide credit liquidity or other support to our funds in the event of significant declines in valuation of fund holdings or significant redemption activity that exceeds available liquidity Such support could cause us to take significant charges could reduce our liquidity and in certain situations could with respect to proprietary funds other than money market mutual funds result in us having to consolidate one or more funds in our financial statements If we choose not to provide credit liquidity or other support in such a situation Schwab could suffer reputational damage and its business could be adversely affected We are subject to litigation and regulatory investigations and proceedings and may not be successful in defending against claims or proceedings The financial services industry faces significant litigation and regulatory risks We are subject to claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of business including arbitrations class actions and other litigation some of which include claims for substantial or unspecified damages We are also the subject of inquiries investigations and proceedings by regulatory and other governmental agencies Litigation and arbitration claims include those brought by our clients and the clients of third party advisors whose assets are custodied at Schwab Claims from clients of third party advisors may allege losses due to investment decisions made by the third party advisors or the advisors misconduct Litigation claims also include claims from third parties alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights eg patents Such litigation can require the expenditure of significant company resources If we were found to have infringed on a thirdparty patent or other intellectual property rights we could incur substantial damages and in some circumstances could be enjoined from using certain technology or providing certain products or services Actions brought against us may result in settlements awards injunctions fines penalties or other results adverse to us including reputational harm Even if we are successful in defending against these actions the defense of such matters may  16  THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION result in us incurring significant expenses A substantial judgment settlement fine or penalty could be material to our operating results or cash flows for a particular future period depending on our results for that period In market downturns and periods of heightened volatility the volume of legal claims and amount of damages sought in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial services companies have historically increased We rely on outsourced service providers to perform key functions We rely on external service providers to perform certain key technology processing servicing and support functions These service providers face technology operating business and economic risks and any significant failures by them including the improper use or disclosure of our confidential client employee or company information could cause us to incur losses and could harm Schwabs reputation An interruption in or the cessation of service by any external service provider as a result of systems failures capacity constraints financial difficulties or for any other reason and our inability to make alternative arrangements in a timely manner could disrupt our operations impact our ability to offer certain products and services and result in financial losses to us Switching to an alternative service provider may require a transition period and result in less efficient operations Potential strategic transactions could have a negative impact on our financial position We evaluate potential strategic transactions including business combinations acquisitions and dispositions Any such transaction could have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows The process of evaluating negotiating and effecting any such strategic transaction may divert managements attention from other business concerns and might cause the loss of key clients employees and business partners Moreover integrating businesses and systems may result in unforeseen expenditures as well as numerous risks and uncertainties including the need to integrate operational financial and management information systems and management controls integrate relationships with clients and business partners and manage facilities and employees in different geographic areas In addition an acquisition may cause us to assume liabilities or become subject to litigation or regulatory proceedings Further we may not realize the anticipated benefits from an acquisition including without limitation the pending acquisitions of TD Ameritrade and assets of USAAIMCO and any future acquisition could be dilutive to our current stockholders percentage ownership or to earnings per common share EPS Our acquisitions and dispositions are typically subject to closing conditions including regulatory approvals and the absence of material adverse changes in the business operations or financial condition of the entity being acquired or sold To the extent we enter into an agreement to buy or sell an entity there can be no guarantee that the transaction will close when expected or at all If a material transaction does not close our stock price could decline Our industry is highly competitive and characterized by aggressive price competition We operate in a highly competitive environment with a broad array of competitors from large integrated banks to venturecapital backed private companies We continually monitor our pricing in relation to competitors and periodically adjust interest rates on deposits and loans fees for advisory services expense ratios on mutual funds and ETFs trade commission rates and other pricing and incentives to sustain our competitive position Increased price competition from other financial services firms to attract clients such as reduced commissions higher deposit rates reduced mutual fund or ETF expense ratios or the increased use of incentives could impact our results of operations and financial condition We face competition in hiring and retaining qualified employees The market for qualified personnel in our business is highly competitive At various times different functions and roles are in especially high demand in the market compelling us to pay more to attract talent Our ability to continue to compete effectively will depend upon our ability to attract new employees and retain existing employees while managing compensation costs  17  THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Our stock price has fluctuated historically and may continue to fluctuate Our stock price can be volatile Among the factors that may affect the volatility of our stock price are the following  Our exposure to changes in interest rates  Speculation in the investment community or the press about or actual changes in our competitive position organizational structure executive team operations financial condition financial reporting and results expense discipline or strategic transactions  The announcement of new products services acquisitions or dispositions by us or our competitors  Increases or decreases in revenue or earnings changes in earnings estimates by the investment community and variations between estimated financial results and actual financial results and  Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock by large stockholders Changes in the stock market generally or as it concerns our industry as well as geopolitical corporate regulatory business and economic factors may also affect our stock price Future sales of CSCs equity securities may adversely affect the market price of CSCs common stock and result in dilution CSCs certificate of incorporation authorizes CSCs Board of Directors among other things to issue additional shares of common or preferred stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into equity securities without stockholder approval CSC may issue additional equity or convertible securities to raise additional capital or for other purposes The issuance of any additional equity or convertible securities could be substantially dilutive to holders of CSCs common stock and may adversely affect the market price of CSCs common stock Risks Related to the Proposed Merger with TD Ameritrade Completion of the merger is subject to many conditions and if these conditions are not satisfied or waived the merger will not be completed The obligations of CSC and TD Ameritrade to complete the merger are subject to satisfaction or to the extent permitted by applicable law waiver of a number of conditions including among others  the affirmative vote of A the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of TD Ameritrade common stock approving and adopting the Merger Agreement and B the holders other than TD Bank the Significant TD Ameritrade Stockholders and their respective affiliates of a majority of the outstanding shares of TD Ameritrade common stock other than shares of TD Ameritrade common stock held by TD Bank the Significant TD Ameritrade Stockholders and their respective affiliates approving and adopting the Merger Agreement  the affirmative vote of A a majority of the votes cast by holders of outstanding shares of Schwab common stock approving the share issuance and B the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Schwab common stock approving the Schwab charter amendment  expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period or extension thereof under the HSR Act and certain governmental authorizations having been made or obtained and being in full force and effect  receipt of noncontrol determinations from the Federal Reserve  accuracy of the representations and warranties made in the Merger Agreement by the other party subject to certain materiality thresholds  performance in all material respects by the other party of the obligations required to be performed by it at or prior to completion of the merger and  the absence since the date of the Merger Agreement of a material adverse effect on the other party There can be no assurance that the conditions to the closing of the merger will be satisfied or waived in a timely manner or at all and accordingly the merger may not be completed If the merger is not completed for any reason the ongoing business of CSC may be adversely affected and without realizing the benefits of having completed the merger we would be subject to a number of risks including that we may receive negative reactions from our stockholders employees customers and regulators and that the price of our common stock may decline to the extent that current market prices reflect a market assumption that the merger will be completed  18  THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION As a condition to authorization of the merger governmental authorities may impose requirements limitations or costs or place restrictions on the conduct of our business after completion of the merger Such conditions or changes and the process of obtaining regulatory approvals could among other things have the effect of delaying completion of the merger or imposing additional material costs on or materially limiting the revenues of the combined company following the merger or otherwise adversely affecting our businesses and results of operations after completion of the merger Also if the Merger Agreement is terminated in certain circumstances we may be required to pay a termination fee of 950 million to TD Ameritrade and we could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the merger or related to any enforcement proceeding commenced against us to perform our obligations under the Merger Agreement In addition the Merger Agreement places certain restrictions on the conduct of our businesses prior to completion of the merger and such restrictions the waiver of which is subject to consent of TD Ameritrade could prevent us from making certain acquisitions taking certain other specified actions or otherwise pursuing business opportunities during the pendency of the merger that we would have made taken or pursued if these restrictions were not in place CSC and TD Ameritrade may also be subject to lawsuits challenging the merger and adverse rulings in these lawsuits may delay or prevent the merger from being completed or require CSC or TD Ameritrade to incur significant costs to defend or settle these lawsuits If any of these risks materialize they may materially and adversely affect our businesses financial condition financial results ratings andor stock price Schwabs business relationships may be subject to disruption due to uncertainty associated with the merger Parties with which we do business may experience uncertainty associated with the merger including with respect to current or future business relationships with Schwab or the combined business Schwabs business relationships may be subject to disruption as parties with which Schwab does business may attempt to negotiate changes in existing business relationships or consider entering into business relationships with parties other than Schwab or the combined business These disruptions could have an adverse effect on the businesses financial condition results of operations or prospects of the combined business including an adverse effect on Schwabs ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger The risk and adverse effect of such disruptions could be exacerbated by a delay in completion of the merger or termination of the Merger Agreement After completion of the merger we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the merger which could adversely affect the value of our stock The success of the merger will depend in significant part on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from combining the businesses of Schwab and TD Ameritrade Our ability to realize these anticipated benefits and cost savings is subject to certain risks If Schwab is not able to successfully combine the businesses of Schwab and TD Ameritrade within the anticipated time frame or at all the anticipated cost savings and other benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected the combined business may not perform as expected and the value of Schwab common stock may be adversely affected Schwab and TD Ameritrade have operated and until completion of the merger will continue to operate independently and there can be no assurances that their businesses can be integrated successfully It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key Schwab or TD Ameritrade employees the loss of clients the disruption of either companys or both companies ongoing businesses or in unexpected integration issues higher than expected integration costs and an overall postcompletion integration process that takes longer than originally anticipated In addition at times the attention of certain members of either companys or both companies management and resources may be focused on completion of the merger and the integration of the businesses of the two companies and diverted from daytoday business operations which may disrupt each companys ongoing business and the business of the combined company Schwab will incur significant transaction and mergerrelated costs in connection with the merger We expect to incur a number of nonrecurring costs associated with the merger and combining the operations of the two  19  THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION companies Some of these costs have already been incurred or may be incurred regardless of whether the merger is completed Schwab also will incur transaction fees and costs related to formulating and implementing integration plans with respect to the two companies including facilities and systems consolidation costs We continue to assess the magnitude of these costs and additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the merger and the integration of the two companies businesses Although we expect that the elimination of duplicative costs as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses should allow us to offset integrationrelated costs over time this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term or at all Schwab and TD Ameritrade may have difficulty attracting

their employment following specified circumstances set forth in their employment agreements or term sheets including certain changes in such employees position compensation or benefits and collect severance Such circumstances could occur in connection with the merger as a result of changes in roles and responsibilities If employees of Schwab or TD Ameritrade depart the integration of the companies may be more difficult and the combined business following the merger may be harmed Furthermore Schwab may have to incur significant costs in identifying hiring and retaining replacements for

adversely affected In addition there could be disruptions to or distractions for the workforce and management associated with integrating employees into Schwab The merger may not be accretive to Schwabs earnings per share which may negatively affect the market price of Schwab common stock following completion of the merger In connection with the completion of the merger Schwab expects to

conditions could reduce or delay the accretion that is currently projected or result in the merger being dilutive to Schwabs earnings per share including adverse changes in market conditions additional transaction and integration related costs and other factors such as the failure to realize some or all of the benefits anticipated in the merger Any dilution of reduction in or delay of any accretion to Schwabs earnings per share could cause the price of shares of Schwab common stock to decline or grow at a reduced rate If our pending merger with TD Ameritrade is completed our stockholders ownership percentage will be diluted If the proposed merger is completed we will issue to TD Ameritrade stockholders shares of our common stock As a result of the issuance of these shares of our common stock our stockholders will own a smaller percentage of the combined company after the merger and will therefore have a reduced voting interest In addition TD Bank will become our
