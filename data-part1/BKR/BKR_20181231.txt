PART I ITEM 1 BUSINESS Baker Hughes a GE company the Company BHGE we us or our a Delaware corporation was formed on October 28 2016 for the purpose of facilitating the combination of Baker Hughes Incorporated a Delaware corporation Baker Hughes or BHI and the oil and gas business GE OG of General Electric Company GE On July 3 2017 we closed our business combination the Transactions to combine GE OG and Baker Hughes creating a fullstream oilfield technology provider that has a unique mix of integrated equipment and service capabilities As a result of the Transactions substantially all of the business of GE OG and of Baker Hughes was transferred to a subsidiary of the Company Baker Hughes a GE company LLC BHGE LLC with GE having an economic interest of approximately 625 and the Company having an economic interest of approximately 375 of BHGE LLC The Transactions were treated as a reverse acquisition for accounting purposes and as such the historical financial statements of the accounting acquirer GE OG are the historical financial statements of the Company The historical financial results in the combined financial statements presented may not be indicative of the results that would have been achieved had GE OG operated as a separate standalone entity during those periods As of December 31 2018  GE held approximately 504 of the economic interest and the Company held approximately 496 of the economic interest in BHGE LLC Although we hold a minority economic interest in BHGE LLC we conduct and exercise full control over all its activities without the approval of any other member Accordingly we consolidate the financial results of BHGE LLC and report a noncontrolling interest in our consolidated and combined financial statements for the economic interest in BHGE LLC not held by us We are a holding company and have no material assets other than our ownership interest in BHGE LLC and certain intercompany and tax related balances BHGE LLC is a Securities and Exchange Commission SEC Registrant with separate filing requirements with the SEC and its separate financial information can be obtained from wwwsecgov In June 2018 GE announced their intention to pursue an orderly separation from BHGE over time On November 13 2018 we entered into a Master Agreement and a series of related ancillary agreements and binding term sheets with GE collectively the Master Agreement Framework designed to further solidify the commercial and technological collaborations between us and GE and to facilitate our ability to transition from operating as a controlled company In particular the Master Agreement Framework contemplates longterm agreements between us and GE on technology fulfillment and other key areas to provide greater clarity to customers employees and shareholders For a discussion of certain risks associated with the separation including risks related to our business financial condition and results of operations see Item 1A Risk FactorsRisks Factors Related to the Transactions and Separation from GE For further details on the Master Agreement Framework see Note 18 Related Party Disclosures of the Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements in Item 8 herein Secondary Offering and LLC Units Repurchase In November 2018 we also completed an underwritten secondary public offering in which GE and its affiliates together the selling stockholders sold 1012 million shares of our Class A common stock We did not receive any proceeds from the shares sold by the selling stockholders in this offering The offering included the exchange by the selling stockholders of common units of BHGE LLC Units together with the corresponding shares of our Class B common stock for our Class A common stock which resulted in increases in capital in excess of par value with offsetting reductions in noncontrolling interests and other comprehensive income Also in November 2018 we repurchased 65 million BHGE LLC Units together with the corresponding shares of our Class B common stock from GE and its affiliates for 15 billion or 2248 per unit which is the same per share price net of discounts and commissions paid by the underwriters to the selling stockholders in the offering the repurchase In connection with the repurchase the corresponding shares of Class B common stock held by GE and its affiliates were canceled As a result of the secondary offering and the repurchase GEs economic interest in BHGE LLC was reduced from approximately 625 to approximately 504 If GEs economic interest in BHGE LLC falls below 50 they would not have a controlling interest Any future declines in their ownership would be accounted for by us as equity transactions reducing their noncontrolling interests BHGE 2018 FORM 10K  1 OUR VISION We are

to draw support from centers of excellence in each of our major product lines No single customer accounted for 10 or more of our revenue in the current year Our products and services are sold in highly competitive markets and the competitive environment varies by product line as discussed below Oilfield Services Our OFS segment believes that the principal competitive factors in the industries and markets it serves are product and service quality reliability and availability health safety and environmental standards technical proficiency and price Our products and services are sold in highly competitive markets and revenue and earnings are affected by changes in commodity prices fluctuations in the level of drilling workover and completion activity in major markets general economic conditions foreign currency exchange fluctuations and governmental regulations While we may have contracts with customers that include multiple well projects and that may extend over a period of time ranging from two to four years our services and products are generally provided on a wellbywell basis Most contracts cover our pricing of the products and services but do not necessarily establish an obligation to use our products and services OFS segment competitors include Schlumberger Halliburton and Weatherford International BHGE 2018 FORM 10K  5 Oilfield Equipment Our OFE segment believes that the principal competitive factors in the industries and markets it serves are product and service quality reliability and on time delivery health safety and environmental standards technical

midstream and downstream segments including fixedfee or turnkey contracts transactional agreements for products and services and longterm aftermarket service agreements We enjoy stable relationships with many of our customers based on longterm project contracts and master service agreements Several of those contracts require us to commit to a fixed price based on the customers technical specifications with little or no legal relief available due to changes in circumstances such as changes in local laws or industry or geopolitical events In some cases failure to deliver products or perform services within contractual commitments may lead to liquidated damages claims We seek to mitigate these exposures through close collaboration with our customers We strive to negotiate the terms of our customer contracts consistent with what we consider to be industry best practices Our customers typically indemnify us for certain claims arising from the injury or death of their employees and often their other contractors the loss of or damage to their equipment and often that of their other contractors pollution originating from their equipment or facility and all liabilities related to the well and subsurface operations including loss or damage to the well or reservoir loss of well control fire explosion or any uncontrolled flow of oil or gas Conversely we typically indemnify our customers for certain claims arising from the injury or death of our employees and sometimes that of our subcontractors the loss of or damage to our equipment other than equipment lost in the hole and pollution originating from our equipment above the surface of the earth while in our care custody and control Where the above indemnities do not apply or are not consistent with industry best practices we typically provide a capped indemnity for damages caused to the customer by our negligence or the negligence of our contractors and include an overall limitation of liability clause It is also our general practice to include a limitation of liability for consequential loss including loss of profits and loss of revenue in all customer contracts BHGE 2018 FORM 10K  6 Our indemnity structure may not protect us in every case Certain US states such as Texas Louisiana Wyoming and New Mexico have enacted oil and natural gas specific antiindemnity statutes These statutes can void the allocation of liability agreed to in a contract however both the Texas and Louisiana antiindemnity statutes include important exclusions The Louisiana statute does not apply to property damage and the Texas statute allows mutual indemnity agreements that are supported by insurance and has exclusions which include among other things loss or liability for property damage that results from pollution and the cost of well control events State law laws or public policy in countries outside the US or the negotiated terms of a customer contract may also limit indemnity obligations in the event of the gross negligence or willful misconduct We sometimes contract with customers that are not the end user of our products It is our practice to seek to obtain an indemnity from our customer for any enduser claims but this is not always possible Similarly government agencies and other third parties including in some cases other contractors of our customers may make claims in respect of which we are not indemnified and for which responsibility is assessed proportionate to fault In all cases deviations from our standard contracting practices are examined through an established risk deviation process The Company maintains a commercial general liability insurance policy program that covers against certain operating hazards including product liability claims and personal injury claims as well as certain limited environmental pollution claims for damage to a third party or its property arising out of contact with pollution for which the Company is liable however clean up and well control costs are not covered by such program All of the insurance policies purchased by the Company are subject to deductible andor selfinsured retention amounts for which we are responsible for payment specific terms conditions limitations and exclusions There can be no assurance that the nature and amount of Company insurance will be sufficient to fully indemnify us against liabilities related to our business RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT We engage in research and development activities directed primarily toward the development of new products services technology and other solutions as well as the improvement of existing products and services and the design of specialized products to meet specific customer needs We continue to invest across all operating segments in products to develop capability improve performance and reduce costs In OFS we invested in a range of formation evaluation capabilities as well as drilling completions and production hardware This included the introduction of Electrical Submersible Pumps ESPs with permanent magnet motors for higher efficiency through reduced power consumption In OFE the recent focus has been to expand capability into deeper water longer offsets and at higher pressures as well as modular designs that allow for simpler and more integrated subsea systems Additionally subsea power and processing is also an area in which we are investing covering both pumping and compression In TPS we continue to invest in continuous product improvement of reciprocating and centrifugal compressors using advanced fluid dynamic simulation and advanced aeromechanics to improve capability operability and efficiency of its centrifugal compressors family Further we continue to invest in our latest generation of gas turbines for energy efficiency and reduced carbon footprint DS continues to invest in advanced digital solutions designed to improve the efficiency reliability and safety of oil and

have continued and permanent rights to commercially utilize some GE intellectual property pursuant to the terms of the IP CrossLicense Agreement We follow a policy of seeking patent and trademark protection in numerous countries and regions throughout the world for products and methods that appear to have commercial significance We believe that protection of our patents trademarks and related intellectual property rights is central to the conduct of our business and aggressively pursue protection of our intellectual property rights against infringement worldwide as we deem appropriate to protect our business Additionally we consider the quality and timely delivery of our products the service we provide to our customers and the technical knowledge and skills of our personnel to be other important components of the portfolio of capabilities and assets supporting our ability to compete SEASONALITY Our operations can be affected by seasonal weather which can temporarily affect the delivery and performance of our products and services and our customers budgetary cycles Examples of seasonal events that can impact our business are set forth below  The severity and duration of both the summer and the winter in North America can have a significant impact on activity levels In Canada the timing and duration of the spring thaw directly affects activity levels which reach seasonal lows during the second quarter and build through the third and fourth quarters to a seasonal high in the first quarter  Adverse weather conditions such as hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico may interrupt or curtail our coastal and offshore drilling or our customers operations cause supply disruptions and result in a loss of revenue and damage to our equipment and facilities which may or may not be insured  Severe weather during the winter months normally results in reduced activity levels in the North Sea and Russia generally in the first quarter and may interrupt or curtail our operations or our customers operations in those areas and result in a loss of revenue  Scheduled repair and maintenance of offshore facilities in the North Sea can reduce activity in the second and third quarters  Many of our international oilfield customers increase orders for certain products and services in the fourth quarter  Our process  pipeline business in the DS segment typically experiences lower sales during the first and fourth quarters of the year due to the Northern Hemisphere winter  Our broader DS business typically experiences higher customer activity as a result of spending patterns in the second half of the year RAW MATERIALS We purchase various raw materials and component parts for use in manufacturing our products and delivering our services The principal raw materials we use include steel alloys chromium nickel titanium barite beryllium copper lead tungsten carbide synthetic and natural diamonds gels sand and other proppants printed circuit boards and other electronic components and hydrocarbonbased chemical feed stocks Raw materials that are essential to our business are normally readily available from multiple sources but may be subject to price volatility Market conditions can trigger constraints in the supply of certain raw materials and we are always seeking ways to ensure the availability and manage the cost of raw materials Our procurement department uses its size and buying power to enhance its access to key materials at competitive prices In addition to raw materials and component parts we also use the products and services of metal fabricators machine shops foundries forge shops assembly operations contract manufacturers logistics providers packagers indirect material providers and others in order to produce and deliver products to customers These materials and services are generally available from multiple sources BHGE 2018 FORM 10K  8 EMPLOYEES As of December 31 2018  we had approximately 66000 employees of which the majority are outside the US Approximately 11 of these employees are represented under collective bargaining agreements or similartype labor arrangements ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS We are committed to the health and safety of people protection of the environment and compliance with environmental laws regulations and our policies Our past and present operations include activities that are subject to extensive domestic including US federal state and local and international regulations with regard to air land and water quality and other environmental matters Regulations continue to evolve and changes in standards of enforcement of existing regulations as well as the enactment of new legislation may require us and our customers to modify supplement or replace equipment or facilities or to change or discontinue present methods of operation Our environmental compliance expenditures and our capital costs for environmental control equipment may change accordingly We are and may in the future be involved in voluntary remediation projects at current and former properties On rare occasions our remediation activities are conducted as specified by a government agencyissued consent decree or agreed order Remediation costs at these properties are accrued using currently available facts existing environmental permits technology and presently enacted laws and regulations For sites where we are primarily responsible for the remediation our cost estimates are developed based on internal evaluations and are not discounted We record accruals when it is probable that we will be obligated to pay amounts for environmental site evaluation remediation or related activities and such amounts can be reasonably estimated Accruals are recorded even if significant uncertainties exist over the ultimate cost of the remediation Ongoing environmental compliance costs such as obtaining environmental permits installation and maintenance of pollution control equipment and waste disposal are expensed as incurred The Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act known as Superfund imposes liability for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment Superfund liability is imposed without regard to fault even if the waste disposal was in compliance with laws and regulations We have been identified as a potentially responsible party PRP at various Superfund sites and we accrue our share of the estimated remediation costs for the site PRPs in Superfund actions have joint and several liability and may be required to pay more than their proportional share of such costs In some cases it is not possible to quantify our ultimate exposure because the projects are either in the investigative or early remediation stage or superfund allocation information is not yet available Based upon current information we believe that our overall compliance with environmental regulations including remediation obligations environmental compliance costs and capital expenditures for environmental control equipment will not have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position because we have either established adequate reserves or our compliance cost based on available information is not expected to be material to our consolidated and combined financial statements Our total accrual for environmental remediation was 84 million and 82 million at December 31 2018 and 2017  respectively We continue to focus on reducing future environmental liabilities by maintaining appropriate Company standards and by improving our assurance programs AVAILABILITY OF INFORMATION FOR STOCKHOLDERS Our annual reports on Form 10K quarterly reports on Form 10Q current

investment in our common stock involves various risks When considering an investment in the Company one should carefully consider all of the risk factors described below as well as other information included and incorporated by reference in this annual report There may be additional risks uncertainties and matters not listed below that we are unaware of or that we currently consider immaterial Any of these may adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows and thus the value of an investment in the Company Risk Factors Related to Our Business We operate in a highly competitive environment which may adversely affect our ability to succeed We operate in a highly competitive environment for marketing oilfield products and services and securing equipment and trained personnel Our ability to continually provide competitive products and services can impact our ability to defend maintain or increase prices for our products and services maintain market share and negotiate acceptable contract terms with our customers In order to be competitive we must provide new BHGE 2018 FORM 10K  11 technologies reliable products and services that perform as expected and that create value for our customers and successfully recruit train and retain competent personnel In addition our investments in new technologies and properties plants and equipment may not provide competitive returns Our ability to defend maintain or increase prices for our products and services is in part dependent on the industrys capacity relative to customer demand and on our ability to differentiate the value delivered by our products and services from our competitors products and services Managing development of competitive technology and new product introductions on a forecasted schedule and at a forecasted cost can impact our financial results If we are unable to continue to develop and produce competitive technology or deliver it to our clients in a timely and costcompetitive manner in various markets in which we operate or if competing technology accelerates the obsolescence of any of our products or services any competitive advantage that we may hold and in turn our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected The high cost or unavailability of infrastructure materials equipment supplies and personnel particularly in periods of rapid growth could adversely affect our ability to execute our operations on a timely basis Our manufacturing operations are dependent on having sufficient raw materials component parts and manufacturing capacity available to meet our manufacturing plans at a reasonable cost while minimizing inventories Our ability to effectively manage our manufacturing operations and meet these goals can have an impact on our business including our ability to meet our manufacturing plans and revenue goals control costs and avoid shortages or oversupply of raw materials and component parts Raw materials and components of particular concern include steel alloys including chromium and nickel titanium barite beryllium copper lead tungsten carbide synthetic and natural diamonds gels sand and other proppants printed circuit boards and other electronic components and hydrocarbonbased chemical feed stocks Our ability to repair or replace equipment damaged or lost in the well can also impact our ability to service our customers A lack of manufacturing capacity could result in increased backlog which may limit our ability to respond to orders with short lead times People are a key resource to developing manufacturing and delivering our products and services to our customers around the world Our ability to manage the recruiting training retention and efficient usage of the highly skilled workforce required by our plans and to manage the associated costs could impact our business A welltrained motivated workforce has a positive impact on our ability to attract and retain business Periods of rapid growth present a challenge to us and our industry to recruit train and retain our employees while also managing the impact of wage inflation and the limited available qualified labor in the markets where we operate Likewise if the economy or markets decline or other changes occur we may have to reduce utilization of our assets or adjust our workforce to control costs which may cause us to lose some of our skilled employees Laborrelated actions including strikes slowdowns and facility occupations can also have a negative impact on our business Our business could be impacted by geopolitical and terrorism threats in countries where we or our customers do business and our business operations may be impacted by civil unrest government expropriations andor epidemic outbreaks Geopolitical and terrorism risks continue to grow in a number of key countries where we currently or may in the future do business Geopolitical and terrorism risks could lead to among other things a loss of our investment in the country impairment of the safety of our employees and impairment of our or our customers ability to conduct operations In addition to other geopolitical and terrorism risks civil unrest continues to grow in a number of key countries where we do business Our ability to conduct business operations may be impacted by that civil unrest and our assets in these countries may also be subject to expropriation by governments or other parties involved in civil unrest Epidemic outbreaks may also impact our business operations by among other things restricting travel to protect the health and welfare of our employees and decisions by our customers to curtail or stop operations in impacted areas BHGE 2018 FORM 10K  12 Compliance with and changes in laws could be costly and could affect operating results In addition government disruptions could negatively impact our ability to conduct our business We have operations in the United States and in more than 120 countries that can be impacted by expected and unexpected changes in the legal and business environments in which we operate Compliancerelated issues could also limit our ability to do business in certain countries and impact our earnings Changes that could impact the legal environment include new legislation new regulations new policies investigations and legal proceedings and new interpretations of existing legal rules and regulations in particular changes in export control laws or exchange control laws additional restrictions on doing business in countries subject to sanctions and changes in laws in countries where we operate In addition changes and uncertainty in the political environments in which our businesses operate can have a material effect on the laws rules and regulations that affect our operations Government disruptions may also delay or halt the granting and renewal of permits licenses and other items required by us and our customers to conduct our business The continued success of our global business and operations depends in part on our ability to continue to anticipate and effectively manage these and other political legal and regulatory risks Increased cybersecurity requirements vulnerabilities threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose risks to our systems networks products solutions services and data Increased global cybersecurity vulnerabilities threats and more sophisticated and targeted cyberrelated attacks pose risks to our systems networks products solutions services and data Cybersecurity attacks also pose risks to our customers partners suppliers and thirdparty service providers products systems and networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of our and our customers data While we attempt to mitigate these risks we remain vulnerable to additional known or unknown threats Given our global footprint the large number of customers with which we do business and the increasing sophistication of cyber attacks a cyber attack could occur and persist for an extended period of time without detection We expect that any investigation of a cyber attack would be inherently unpredictable and that it would take time before the completion of any investigation and before there is availability of full and reliable information During such time we would not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated all or any of which would further increase the costs and consequences of a cyber attack We also may have access to sensitive confidential or personal data or information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws regulations and customerimposed controls Despite our efforts to protect sensitive confidential or personal data or information we may be vulnerable to material security breaches theft misplaced or lost data programming errors employee errors andor malfeasance that could potentially lead to the compromising of sensitive confidential or personal data or information improper use of our systems software solutions or networks unauthorized access use disclosure modification or destruction of information defective products production downtimes and operational disruptions In addition a cyberrelated attack could adversely impact our operating results and result in other negative consequences including damage to our reputation or competitiveness remediation or increased protection costs litigation or regulatory action fines and penalties Our failure to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act FCPA and other similar laws could have a negative impact on our ongoing operations Our ability to comply with the FCPA the UK Bribery Act and various other antibribery and anticorruption laws depends on the success of our ongoing compliance program including our ability to successfully manage our agents distributors and other business partners and supervise train and retain competent employees Our compliance program depends on the efforts of our employees agents distributors and other business partners to comply with applicable law and our internal policies We could be subject to sanctions and civil and criminal prosecution as well as fines and penalties in the event of a finding of a violation of any of these laws by us or any of our employees Antimoney laundering and antiterrorism financing laws could have significant adverse consequences for us We maintain an enterprisewide program designed to enable us to comply with all applicable antimoney laundering and antiterrorism financing laws and regulations including the Bank Secrecy Act and the Patriot Act This program includes policies procedures processes and other internal controls designed to identify monitor manage and mitigate the risk of money laundering or terrorist financing posed by our products services customers BHGE 2018 FORM 10K  13 and geographic locale These controls establish procedures and processes to detect and report suspicious transactions perform customer due diligence respond to requests from law enforcement and meet all recordkeeping and reporting requirements related to particular transactions involving currency or monetary instruments We cannot be sure our programs and controls are or will remain effective to ensure our compliance with all applicable antimoney laundering and antiterrorism financing laws and regulations and our failure to comply could subject us to significant sanctions fines penalties and reputational harm all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition Changes in tax laws tax rates tariffs adverse positions taken by taxing authorities and tax audits could impact operating results Changes in tax laws tax rates tariffs changes in interpretation of tax laws the resolution of tax assessments or audits by various tax authorities and the ability to fully utilize tax loss carryforwards and tax credits could impact our operating results including additional valuation allowances for deferred tax assets In addition we may periodically restructure our legal entity organization If taxing authorities were to disagree with our tax positions in connection with any such restructurings our effective tax rate could be materially impacted Our operations involve a variety of operating hazards and risks that could cause losses The products that we manufacture and the services that we provide are complex and the failure of our equipment to operate properly or to meet specifications may greatly increase our customers costs In addition many of these products are used in inherently hazardous industries such as the offshore oilfield business These hazards include blowouts explosions nuclearrelated events fires collisions capsizings and severe weather conditions We may incur substantial liabilities or losses as a result of these hazards While we maintain insurance protection against some of these risks and seek to obtain indemnity agreements from our customers requiring the customers to hold us harmless from some of these risks our insurance and contractual indemnity protection may not be sufficient or effective to protect us under all circumstances or against all risks The occurrence of a significant event against which we were not fully insured or indemnified or the failure of a customer to meet its indemnification obligations to us could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition Compliance with and rulings and litigation in connection with environmental and climate change regulations and the environmental and climate change impacts of our or our customers operations may adversely affect our business and operating results We and our business are impacted by material changes in environmental laws regulations rulings and litigation Our expectations regarding our compliance with environmental laws and regulations and our expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations including without limitation our capital expenditures for environmental control equipment are only our forecasts regarding these matters These forecasts may be substantially different from actual results which may be affected by factors such as changes in law that impose restrictions on air emissions wastewater management waste disposal hydraulic fracturing or wetland and land use practices more stringent enforcement of existing environmental laws and regulations a change in our share of any remediation costs or other unexpected adverse outcomes with respect to sites where we have been named as a potentially responsible party including without limitation Superfund sites the discovery of other sites where additional expenditures may be required to comply with environmental legal obligations and the accidental discharge of hazardous materials International national and state governments and agencies continue to evaluate and promulgate legislation and regulations that are focused on restricting emissions commonly referred to as greenhouse gas GHG emissions In the United States the US Environmental Protection Agency EPA has taken steps to regulate GHG emissions as air pollutants under the US Clean Air Act of 1970 as amended The EPAs Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule requires monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from among others certain mobile and stationary GHG emission sources in the oil and natural gas industry which in turn may include data from certain of our wellsite equipment and operations In addition the US government has proposed rules in the past setting GHG emission standards for or otherwise aimed at reducing GHG emissions from the oil and natural gas industry Caps or fees on carbon emissions including in the United States have been and may continue to be established and the cost of such caps or fees could disproportionately affect the fossilfuel energy sector We are unable to predict whether and when the proposed changes in laws or regulations ultimately will occur or what they ultimately BHGE 2018 FORM 10K  14 will require and accordingly we are unable to assess the potential financial or operational impact they may have on our business Other developments focused on restricting GHG emissions include the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change which includes the Paris Agreement and the Kyoto Protocol the European Union Emission Trading System Article 8 of the European Union Energy Efficiency Directive and the United Kingdoms Carbon Reduction Commitment Energy Efficiency and Energy Savings Opportunity ESOS schemes and in the United States the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative the Western Climate Action Initiative and various state programs implementing the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 known as Assembly Bill 32 The potential for climate related changes may pose future risks to our operations and those of our customers These changes can include extreme variability in weather patterns such as increased frequency of severe weather rising mean temperature and sea levels and longterm changes in precipitation patterns Such changes have the potential to affect business continuity and operating results particularly at facilities in coastal areas Uninsured claims and litigation against us could adversely impact our operating results We could be impacted by the outcome of pending litigation as well as unexpected litigation or proceedings While we have insurance coverage against operating hazards including product liability claims and personal injury claims related to our products to the extent deemed prudent by our management and to the extent insurance is available no assurance can be given that the nature and amount of that insurance will be sufficient to fully indemnify us against liabilities arising out of pending and future claims and litigation This insurance has deductibles or selfinsured retentions and contains certain coverage exclusions The insurance does not cover damages from breach of contract by us or based on alleged fraud or deceptive trade practices In addition the following risks apply with respect to our insurance coverage  we may not be able to continue to obtain insurance on commercially reasonable terms  we may be faced with types of liabilities that will not be covered by our insurance  our insurance carriers may not be able to meet their obligations under the policies or  the dollar amount of any liabilities may exceed our policy limits Control of oil and natural gas reserves by stateowned oil companies may impact the demand for our services and products and create additional risks in our operations Much of the worlds oil and natural gas reserves are controlled by stateowned oil companies Stateowned oil companies may require their contractors to meet local content requirements or other local standards such as conducting our operations through joint ventures with local partners that could be difficult or undesirable for us to meet The failure to meet the local content requirements and other local standards may adversely impact our operations in those countries In addition our ability to work with stateowned oil companies is subject to our ability to negotiate and agree upon acceptable contract terms Providing services on an integrated or turnkey basis could require us to assume additional risks We may enter into integrated contracts or turnkey contracts with our customers and we may choose to provide services outside our core business Providing services on an integrated or turnkey basis may subject us to additional risks such as costs associated with unexpected delays or difficulties in drilling or completion operations and risks associated with subcontracting arrangements Some of our customers require bids in the form of fixed pricing contracts Some of our customers require bids for contracts in the form of fixed pricing contracts that may require us to provide integrated project management services outside our normal discrete business and to act as project managers as well as service providers and may require us to assume additional risks associated with cost overruns These customers may provide us with inaccurate information in relation to their reserves The estimation of reserves is a process that involves subjective judgment about likely location and volume and estimates that prove BHGE 2018 FORM 10K  15 inaccurate may result in cost overruns delays and project losses for us or our customers which may adversely impact our business and our relationship with our customers The credit risks of having a concentrated customer base in the energy industry could result in losses Having a concentration of customers in the energy industry may impact our overall exposure to credit risk as our customers may be similarly affected by prolonged changes in economic and industry conditions Some of our customers may experience extreme financial distress as a result of falling commodity prices and may be forced to seek protection under applicable bankruptcy laws which may affect our ability to recover any amounts due from such customers Furthermore countries that rely heavily upon income from hydrocarbon exports have been and may in the future be negatively and significantly affected by a drop in oil prices which could affect our ability to collect from our customers in these countries particularly national oil companies Laws in some jurisdictions in which we will operate could make collection difficult or time consuming We will perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and do not expect to require collateral in support of our trade receivables While we maintain reserves for potential credit losses we cannot assure such reserves will be sufficient to meet writeoffs of uncollectible receivables or that our losses from such receivables will be consistent with our expectations Additionally in the event of a bankruptcy of any of our customers we may be treated as an unsecured creditor and may collect substantially less or none of the amounts owed to us by such customer Our Remaining Performance Obligations RPO are subject to modification termination or reduction of orders which could negatively impact our sales Our RPO is comprised of unfilled customer orders for products and product services expected life of contract sales for product services Our RPO can be significantly affected by the timing of orders for large projects Although modifications and terminations of orders may be partially offset by cancellation fees customers can and sometimes do terminate or modify orders Our failure to replace canceled orders could negatively impact our sales and results of operations The total dollar amount of the Companys RPO as of December 31 2018 was 210 billion  We may not be able to satisfy technical requirements testing requirements or other specifications required under our service contracts and equipment purchase agreements Our products are used in deepwater and other harsh environments and severe service applications Our contracts with customers and customer requests for bids typically set forth detailed specifications or technical requirements for our products and services which may also include extensive testing requirements We anticipate that such testing requirements will become more common in our contracts In addition recent scrutiny of the offshore drilling industry has resulted in more stringent technical specifications for our products and more comprehensive testing requirements for our products to ensure compliance with such specifications We cannot provide assurance that our products will be able to satisfy the specifications or that we will be able to perform the fullscale testing necessary to prove that the product specifications are satisfied in future contract bids or under existing contracts or that the costs of modifications to our products to satisfy the specifications and testing will not adversely affect our results of operations If our products are unable to satisfy such requirements or we are unable to perform any required fullscale testing our customers may cancel their contracts andor seek new suppliers and our business results of operations cash flows or financial position may be adversely affected Currency fluctuations or devaluations may impact our operating results Fluctuations or devaluations in foreign currencies relative to the US dollar can impact our revenue and our costs of doing business as well as the costs of doing business of our customers Most of our products and services are sold through contracts denominated in US dollars or local currency indexed to US dollars however some of our revenue local expenses and manufacturing costs are incurred in local currencies and therefore changes in the exchange rates between the US dollar and foreign currencies can increase or decrease our revenue and expenses reported in US dollars or revenue and expenses of our customers and consequently may impact the ability of our customers to satisfy their payment obligations and our results of operations BHGE 2018 FORM 10K  16 Changes in economic andor market conditions may impact our ability to borrow andor cost of borrowing The condition of the capital markets and equity markets in general can affect the price of our common stock and our ability to obtain financing if necessary If our credit rating is ever downgraded it could increase borrowing costs under credit facilities and commercial paper programs as well as increase the cost of renewing or obtaining or make it more difficult to renew obtain or issue new debt financing An inability to protect our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business There can be no assurance that the steps we take to obtain maintain and protect our intellectual property rights will be completely adequate Our intellectual property rights may fail to provide us with significant competitive advantages particularly in foreign jurisdictions where we have not invested in an intellectual property portfolio or that do not have or do not enforce strong intellectual property rights The weakening of protection of our trademarks patents and other intellectual property rights could also adversely affect our business We are a party to a number of licenses that give us rights to intellectual property that is necessary or useful to our business including from GE following the Transactions Our success depends in part on the ability of our licensors to obtain maintain and sufficiently enforce the licensed intellectual property rights we have commercialized Without protection for the intellectual property rights we license other companies might be able to offer substantially identical products for sale which could adversely affect our competitive business position and harm our business products Also there can be no assurances that we will be able to obtain or renew from third parties the licenses to use intellectual property rights we need in the future and there is no assurance that such licenses can be obtained on reasonable terms Specifically we are a party to several agreements with GE which provide for intellectual property rights to use and access Access and use of intellectual property created solely or collaboratively with GE is an important part of our operations We would be adversely affected in the event these agreements were terminated without the right to continue such access as we might continue to improve current products and services or develop new ones We may be subject to litigation if another party claims that we have infringed upon its intellectual property rights The tools techniques methodologies programs and components we use to provide our products and services may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others or be challenged on that basis Regardless of the merits infringement claims may result in significant legal and other costs and may distract management from running our core business Resolving such claims could increase our costs including through royalty payments to acquire licenses if available from third parties and through the development of noninfringing technologies If a license to resolve a claim were not available we might not be able to continue providing a particular service or product which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows The effects of Brexit may have a negative impact on our financial results and operations of the business In June 2016 United Kingdom UK voters approved the UKs exit Brexit from the European Union EU The political and economic uncertainty surrounding Brexit if it occurs or in whatever form it occurs could harm our business and financial results due to fluctuations in the value of the British pound versus the US dollar euro and other currencies In addition Brexit could result in delayed deliveries which may impact our internal supply chain and our customer projects Risk Factors Related to the Worldwide Oil and Natural Gas Industry Volatility of oil and natural gas prices can adversely affect demand for our products and services Prices of oil and gas products are set on a commodity basis As a result the volatility in oil and natural gas prices can impact our customers activity levels and spending for our products and services Current energy prices are important contributors to cash flow for our customers and their ability to fund exploration and development activities Expectations about future prices and price volatility are important for determining future spending levels Lower oil and natural gas prices generally lead to decreased spending by our customers While higher oil and natural gas prices generally lead to increased spending by our customers sustained high energy prices can be an impediment to economic growth and can therefore negatively impact spending by our customers Our customers also take into account the volatility of energy prices and other risk factors by requiring higher returns for individual BHGE 2018 FORM 10K  17 projects if there is higher perceived risk Any of these factors could affect the demand for oil and natural gas and could have a material effect on our results of operations Demand for oil and natural gas is subject to factors beyond our control which may adversely affect our operating results Changes in the global economy could impact our customers spending levels and our revenue and operating results Demand for oil and natural gas as well as the demand for our services and products is highly correlated with global economic growth and in particular by the economic growth of countries such as the US India China and developing countries in Asia and the Middle East which are either significant users of oil and natural gas or whose economies are experiencing the most rapid economic growth compared to the global average Weakness or deterioration of the global economy or credit markets could reduce our customers spending levels and reduce our revenue and operating results Incremental weakness in global economic activity particularly in China India Europe the Middle East and developing countries in Asia could reduce demand for oil and natural gas and result in lower oil and natural gas prices Incremental strength in global economic activity in such areas will create more demand for oil and natural gas and support higher oil and natural gas prices A prolonged reduction in oil and natural gas prices may require us to record additional asset impairments Such a potential impairment charge could have a material adverse impact on our operating results Requirements and voluntary initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as well as increased climate change awareness are likely to result in increased costs for the oil and gas industry to curb greenhouse gas emissions and could have an adverse impact on demand for oil and natural gas International national and state governments agencies and bodies continue to evaluate and promulgate regulations and voluntary initiatives that are focused on restricting GHG emissions These requirements and initiatives are likely to become more stringent over time and to result in increased costs for the oil and gas industry to curb GHG emissions In addition these developments and public perception relating to climate change may curtail production and demand for hydrocarbons such as oil and natural gas by shifting demand towards and investment in relatively lower carbon energy sources such as wind solar and other renewables The renewable energy industry is developing enhanced technologies and becoming more competitive with fossilfuel energy If renewable energy becomes more competitive than fossilfuel energy particularly during periods of higher oil and natural gas prices it could have a material effect on our results of operations Supply of oil and natural gas is subject to factors beyond our control which may adversely affect our operating results Productive capacity for oil and natural gas is dependent on our customers decisions to develop and produce oil and natural gas reserves and on the regulatory environment in which our customers and we operate The ability to produce oil and natural gas can be affected by the number and productivity of new wells drilled and completed as well as the rate of production and resulting depletion of existing wells Advanced technologies such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing improve total recovery but also result in a more rapid production decline and may become subject to more stringent regulation particularly on the state or local level in the future Productive capacity in excess of demand spare productive capacity is also an important factor influencing energy prices and spending by oil and natural gas exploration companies Spare productive capacity and oil and natural gas storage inventory levels are an indicator of the relative balance between supply and demand High or increasing storage inventories or spare productive capacity generally indicate that supply is exceeding demand and that energy prices are likely to soften Low or decreasing storage inventories or spare productive capacity are generally an indicator that demand is growing faster than supply and that energy prices are likely to rise Access to prospects is also important to our customers but such access may be limited because host governments do not allow access to the reserves Government regulations and the costs incurred by oil and natural gas exploration companies to conform to and comply with government regulations may also limit the quantity of oil and natural gas that may be economically produced Supply can also be impacted by the degree to which individual OPEC nations and other large oil and natural gas producing countries are willing and able to control production and exports of oil to decrease or increase supply and to support their targeted oil price while meeting their market share objectives Any of these factors could affect the supply of oil and natural gas and could have a material effect on our results of operations BHGE 2018 FORM 10K  18 Our customers activity levels and spending for our products and services and ability to pay amounts owed us could be impacted by the reduction of their cash flow and the ability of our customers to access equity or credit markets Our customers access to capital is dependent on their ability to access the funds necessary to develop economically attractive projects based upon their expectations of future energy prices required investments and resulting returns Limited access to external sources of funding has caused and may continue to cause customers to reduce their capital spending plans to levels supported by internally generated cash flow In addition a reduction of cash flow resulting from declines in commodity prices a reduction in borrowing bases under reservebased credit facilities or the lack of available debt or equity financing may impact the ability of our customers to pay amounts owed to us and could cause us to increase our reserve for doubtful accounts Seasonal and weather conditions could adversely affect demand for our services and operations Variation from normal weather patterns such as cooler or warmer summers and winters can have a significant impact on demand for our services and operations Adverse weather conditions such as hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico may interrupt or curtail our operations or our customers operations cause supply disruptions and result in a loss of revenue and damage to our equipment and facilities which may or may not be insured For example extreme winter conditions in Canada Russia or the North Sea may interrupt or curtail our operations or our customers operations in those areas and result in a loss of revenue Risk Factors Related to the Transactions and Separation from GE We may experience challenges relating to the ongoing integration of Baker Hughes and GE OG or the separation from GE that may result in a decline in the anticipated benefits of the Transactions and the Master Agreement Framework The Transactions involved the combination of two businesses that previously operated as independent businesses The Company has been and will continue to be required to devote management attention and resources to integrating its business practices and operations as well as to the separation from GE If we experience difficulties with the ongoing integration process or with the separation from GE the anticipated benefits of the Transactions and the Master Agreement Framework may not be realized fully or at all may take longer to realize than expected or may be offset by the decrease in business from certain customers or other negative impacts These integration matters and the impact of the separation from GE could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or other prospects on an ongoing basis We have incurred and will continue to incur costs in connection with the Transactions and the integration of the two businesses We also have incurred and expect to continue to incur additional costs in connection with the Master Agreement Framework and the separation from GE The Transactions involved the combination of two businesses that previously operated as independent businesses As a result of the Transactions there are many systems that must be successfully integrated between the two businesses including information management purchasing accounting and finance sales billing payroll and benefits fixed asset and lease administration systems and regulatory compliance Separately on November 13 2018 the Company BHGE LLC and GE entered into the Master Agreement Framework designed to further solidify the commercial and technological relationships between the two companies and to facilitate BHGEs ability to transition from operating as a controlled company In particular the Master Agreement Framework contemplates longterm agreements between the Company BHGE LLC and GE on technology fulfillment and other key areas to provide greater clarity to customers employees and shareholders Certain of the transactions contemplated by the Master Agreement Framework may be subject to regulatory approvals The Company has been and will continue to be required to devote management attention and resources to integrating its business practices and operations as well as to the separation from GE Our entry into the Master Agreement Framework with GE the ongoing integration of Baker Hughes and GE OG the separation from GE and any necessary changes to complete integration efforts based on the new business arrangements contemplated by the Master Agreement Framework may result in additional costs and difficulties Actual costs related to the separation and the implementation of the changes contemplated by the BHGE 2018 FORM 10K  19 Master Agreement Framework may be higher than anticipated and we may experience additional difficulties in effecting such changes We are a controlled company within the meaning of the NYSE rules and as a result qualify for and are relying on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements As a result our stockholders do not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to such requirements The interests of GE as a majority stockholder may differ from the interests of other stockholders of the Company If we do not retain controlled company status in the event that GE sells additional equity in the future we may during the phasein period continue to rely on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements that provide protection to stockholders of other companies Through its ownership of a majority of our voting power and the provisions set forth in our charter our bylaws and the Stockholders Agreement GE has the ability to designate and elect a majority of our directors until the later of July 3 2019 and the first date on which it ceases to hold more than 50 of the voting power of our outstanding common stock the Trigger Date As a result of GEs ownership of a majority of the voting power of our common stock we are a controlled company as defined in NYSE listing rules and therefore are not subject to NYSE requirements that would otherwise require us to have i a majority of independent directors ii a nominating committee composed solely of independent directors iii the compensation of our executive officers determined by a majority of the independent directors or a compensation committee composed solely of independent directors and iv director nominees selected or recommended for the boards selection either by a majority of the independent directors or a nominating committee composed solely of independent directors In connection with the Master Agreement Framework the Stockholders Agreement was amended and restated to provide that following the Trigger Date and until GE and its affiliates own less than 20 of the voting power of our outstanding common stock GE shall be entitled to designate one person for nomination to our board of directors See Note 18 Related Party Transactions of the Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements in Item 8 herein In the event that GE sells additional equity in the future GE may cease to control a majority of our voting power Accordingly we may no longer be a controlled company as defined in NYSE listing rules Under the listing rules a company that ceases to be a controlled company must comply with the independent board committee requirements as they relate to the nominating and corporate governance and compensation committees on the following phasein schedule 1 one independent committee member at the time it ceases to be a controlled company 2 a majority of independent committee members within 90 days of the date it ceases to be a controlled company and 3 all independent committee members within one year of the date it ceases to be a controlled company Additionally NYSE listing rules provide a 12month phasein period from the date a company ceases to be a controlled company to comply with the majority independent board requirement Although we believe we would be able to modify the composition of our board in a timely manner during these phasein periods our stockholders may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies of which the majority of directors are independent Furthermore a change in our board of directors and committee membership may result in a change in corporate strategy and operation philosophies and may result in deviations from our current strategy The Company is a party to the tax matters agreement with GE the Tax Matters Agreement entered into at closing of the Transactions and amended under the Master Agreement Framework Under the Tax Matters Agreement the Company could under certain circumstances be entitled to receive tax benefits in connection with the sale by GE of its equity interests in the Company However there is no assurance that the Company will realize any such benefits GE also has control over certain matters submitted to stockholders for approval including changes in capital structure transactions requiring stockholder approval under Delaware law and corporate governance subject to the terms of the Stockholders Agreement relating to GEs agreement to vote in favor of director nominees not designated by GE and to proposals by GE to acquire all of the shares of Class A common stock held by nonGE stockholders Even if GE sells additional equity in the future and is no longer a majority stockholder GE may still exercise control or significant influence over matters submitted to our stockholders for approval GE may also have influence over matters that do not require stockholder approval GE may have different interests than other holders of Class A common stock on these and other matters which may affect our operational and financial decisions Among other things GEs control could delay defer or prevent a sale of the Company that other stockholders support or conversely this control could result in the consummation of such a transaction that other stockholders do not support This concentrated control could discourage a potential investor from seeking to acquire Class A common stock and as a result might harm the market price of that Class A common stock BHGE 2018 FORM 10K  20 Given GEs ownership of the majority of our outstanding voting securities and the interactions that have taken place and will take place between us and GE our success depends in part on the reputation and success of GE In the event that we are no longer controlled by GE our success will remain partially dependent on GE through among other things their participation in our business operations and strategy as described above our reliance on the longterm agreements and transition services agreements between the Company and GE pursuant to the Master Agreement Framework and the public perception of our affiliation with GE If we were to cease being a majorityowned subsidiary of GE in the future such a separation could adversely affect our business and profitability Uncertainty about the likelihood of any such separation could also adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations Following the Transactions we market many of our products and services using the GE brand name and logo Although we believe that the association with GE provides many benefits including a strong brand broad research and development capabilities elevated status with suppliers and customers and established relationships with regulators we may in the future determine to rebrand our business or pursue alternative marketing strategies which could adversely affect our ability to attract new customers or maintain existing business relationships with customers suppliers and other business partners all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations Although GE has licensed to us the right to use certain GE marks in its corporate name and in the products and services of our business in connection with certain oil and gas activities and other discrete oil and gas segments that right to use these marks would be lost if the license were to expire or otherwise terminate which may occur among other reasons in the event we cease being a majorityowned subsidiary of GE subject to certain phaseout provisions As a consequence of such expiration or termination we would need to remove the GE marks from our corporate name products and services In addition if we were to cease being a majorityowned subsidiary of GE or there were otherwise a meaningful change in the relationships between GE and the Company beyond what is contemplated by the Master Agreement Framework such an event or events could adversely affect among other things our ability to attract and retain customers We may be required to provide more favorable pricing and other terms to our customers and take other action to maintain our relationship with existing and attract new customers all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations For example although GE would be subject to certain noncompete restrictions for a period of time following the Company no longer being a majorityowned subsidiary of GE in the absence of an agreement regulating the gotomarket strategy and the reciprocal commercial and technical support between GE and the Company GE may attempt to compete with us with respect to certain technologies and customer projects where we have adjacent or overlapping presence eg steam turbines and gas turbines Furthermore we may lose cost synergies joint investment and RD opportunities and access to customers in fields where we and GE currently collaborate as per the terms of the Channel Agreement eg additive manufacturing digital The potential separation from GE has created and may continue to create uncertainty among our customers suppliers and other business partners In addition the Master Agreement Framework and related binding term sheets contemplate entering into a number of definitive agreements based on terms included therein If we are unable to enter into definitive agreements with GE for any reason by certain specified deadlines the business arrangements contemplated by the Master Agreement Framework may by their terms take effect in the absence of definitive agreements which may lead to additional uncertainty and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations The potential uncertainty due to these or other factors may undermine our business and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and may cause increased volatility and wide price fluctuations in our stock price The market price of our Class A common stock could be materially impacted due to the substantial number of shares of our capital stock eligible for sale in future secondary offerings by GE The large number of shares of our Class A common stock eligible for sale by GE in the future could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to substantially decrease GE owned approximately 504 percent of our outstanding Class A common stock as of December 31 2018 assuming full exchange of our shares of Class B common stock pursuant to the Exchange Agreement Future sales of a substantial number of shares of our Class BHGE 2018 FORM 10K  21 A common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales could occur could substantially decrease the market price of our Class A common stock The market price and trading volume of our Class A common stock may be volatile which could result in rapid and substantial losses for our stockholders The market price of our Class A common stock may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations In addition the trading volume in our Class A common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur If the market price of our Class A common stock declines significantly you may be unable to sell your shares of our Class A common stock at or above your purchase price if at all We cannot assure you that the market price of our Class A common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future Some of the factors that could negatively affect the price of our Class A common stock or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our Class A common stock include variations in our quarterly operating results failure to meet our earnings estimates publication of research reports about us or our industry or the failure of securities analysts to cover our Class A common stock after the offering additions or departures of our executive officers and other key management personnel adverse market reaction to any indebtedness we may incur or securities we may issue in the future actions by stockholders offerings of our Class A common stock by GE or the perceived possibility of such offerings changes in market valuations of similar companies speculation in the press or investment community changes or proposed changes in laws or regulations or differing interpretations thereof affecting our business or enforcement of these laws and regulations or announcements relating to these matters adverse publicity about our industry generally or individual scandals specifically and general market and economic conditions Antitakeover provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law might discourage or delay acquisition attempts for us that you might consider favorable Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable by permitting our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock requiring advance notice for stockholder proposals and nominations and placing limitations on convening stockholder meetings These provisions may also discourage acquisition proposals or delay or prevent a change in control which could harm our stock price BHGE 2018 FORM 10K  22 ITEM 1B UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None ITEM 2 PROPERTIES We own or lease numerous
