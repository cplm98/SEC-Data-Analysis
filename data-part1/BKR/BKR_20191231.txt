industrial value chain We conduct business in more than 120 countries and employ approximately 68000 employees The Company was formed as the result of a combination between Baker Hughes Incorporated BHI and the oil and gas business GE OG of General Electric Company GE the Transactions which resulted in GE owning approximately 625 of the Company As a result of the Transactions substantially all of the business of GE OG and of Baker Hughes was transferred to a subsidiary of the Company Baker Hughes a GE company LLC BHGE LLC As of September 16 2019 GE ceased to hold more than 50 of the voting power of all classes of our outstanding voting stock Subsequently on October 17 2019 the Company changed its name from Baker Hughes a GE company to Baker Hughes Company On October 18 2019 the Company began trading as BKR on the New York Stock Exchange SEPARATION FROM GE In June 2018 GE announced their intention to pursue an orderly separation from Baker Hughes over time To that end in November 2018 we completed a secondary public offering in which GE and its affiliates sold 1012 million shares of our Class A common stock We did not receive any proceeds from the shares sold by GE and its affiliates The offering included the exchange by GE and its affiliates of common units of BHGE LLC LLC Units together with the corresponding shares of our Class B common stock for our Class A common stock Also in November 2018 we repurchased 65 million of our Class B common stock together with an equal number of associated LLC Units from GE and its affiliates for 15 billion  In connection with this repurchase the corresponding shares of Class B common stock and LLC Units were canceled As a result of this secondary offering and repurchase GEs interest in Baker Hughes was reduced from approximately 625 to approximately 504  In November 2018 we entered into a Master Agreement and a series of related ancillary agreements and binding term sheets with GE and BHGE LLC collectively the Master Agreement Framework which were later negotiated into definitive agreements designed to further solidify the commercial and technological collaboration between us and GE The Master Agreement Framework focuses on areas where we work most closely with GE on developing leading technology and executing for customers First we defined the parameters for longterm collaboration and partnership with GE on critical rotating equipment technology Second for our digital software and technology business we agreed to maintain the status quo as the exclusive supplier of GE Digital oil andgas applications although this commercial arrangement was modified pursuant to the Omnibus Agreement discussed below including by rendering the relationship with GE Digital to be nonexclusive with respect to digital offerings in the oil and gas space Finally we reached agreements on a number of other areas including our controls business pension taxes and intercompany services All agreements within the Master Agreement Framework were finalized by the first quarter of 2019 In July 2019 we also entered into an Omnibus Agreement a general framework agreement that addresses certain outstanding matters under existing longterm commercial agreements between us and GE The Omnibus Agreement contains provisions regarding among other things i the repayment of certain outstanding amounts mutually owed by the parties ii certain employee and assets transfers including the allocation of costs and expenses associated therewith and iii certain matters related to three international joint ventures Modifications to the commercial arrangements between us and GE included among other things modification of the relationship between BHGE LLC and GE Digital to be nonexclusive with respect to digital offerings in the oil and gas space In September 2019 we completed another secondary public offering in which GE and its affiliates sold 1323 million shares of our Class A common stock We did not receive any proceeds from the shares sold by GE and its affiliates in this offering The offering included the exchange by GE and its affiliates of LLC Units together with the corresponding shares of our Class B common stock for our Class A common stock Also in September 2019 we repurchased 119 million shares of our Class B common stock together with an equal number of associated LLC Units from GE and its affiliates for 250 million  In connection with this repurchase the corresponding shares of Class B common stock and LLC Units were canceled As a result of this secondary offering and repurchase GEs interest in Baker Hughes was reduced to approximately 368  and therefore GE ceased to hold more than 50 of Baker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10K  1 the voting power of all classes of our

with many of our customers based on longterm project contracts and master service agreements Several of those contracts require us to commit to a fixed price based on the customers technical specifications with little or no legal relief available due to changes in circumstances such as changes in local laws or industry or geopolitical events In some cases failure to deliver products or perform services within contractual commitments may lead to liquidated damages claims We seek to mitigate these exposures through close collaboration with our customers Baker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10K  6 We strive to negotiate the terms of our customer contracts consistent with what we consider to be industry best practices Our customers typically indemnify us for certain claims arising from the injury or death of their employees and often their other contractors the loss of or damage to their facility and equipment and often that of their other contractors pollution originating from their equipment or facility and all liabilities related to the well and subsurface operations including loss or damage to the well or reservoir loss of well control fire explosion or any uncontrolled flow of oil or gas Conversely we typically indemnify our customers for certain claims arising from the injury or death of our employees and sometimes that of our subcontractors the loss of or damage to our equipment and pollution originating from our equipment above the surface of the earth while under our control Where the above indemnities do not apply or are not consistent with industry best practices we typically provide a capped indemnity for damages caused to the customer by our negligence and include an overall limitation of liability clause It is also our general practice to include a limitation of liability for consequential loss including loss of profits and loss of revenue in all customer contracts Our indemnity structure may not protect us in every case Certain US states have enacted oil and natural gas specific antiindemnity statutes that can void the allocation of liability agreed to in a contract State law laws in countries outside the US public policy or the negotiated terms of a customer contract may also limit indemnity obligations in the event of the gross negligence or willful misconduct We sometimes contract with customers that are not the end user of our products It is our practice to seek to obtain an indemnity from our customer for any enduser claims but this is not always possible Similarly government agencies and other third parties including in some cases other contractors of our customers may make claims in respect of which we are not indemnified and for which responsibility is assessed proportionate to fault Deviations from our standard contracting practices are examined through an established risk deviation process The Company maintains a commercial general liability insurance policy program that covers against certain operating hazards including product liability claims and personal injury claims as well as certain limited environmental pollution claims for damage to a third party or its property arising out of contact with pollution for which the Company is liable however clean up and well control costs are not covered by such program All of the insurance policies purchased by the Company are subject to deductible andor selfinsured retention amounts for which we are responsible for payment specific terms conditions limitations and exclusions There can be no assurance that the nature and amount of Company insurance will be sufficient to fully indemnify us against liabilities related to our business RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT We engage in research and development activities directed primarily toward the development of new products services technology and other solutions as well as the improvement of existing products services and the design of specialized products to meet specific customer needs We continue to invest across all operating segments in products to enhance safety develop capability improve performance and reduce costs aligned with our operational strategy In OFS we invested in a range of

SEASONALITY Our operations can be affected by seasonal weather which can temporarily affect the delivery and performance of our products and services and our customers budgetary cycles Examples of seasonal events that can impact our business are set forth below  The severity and duration of both the summer and the winter in North America can have a significant impact on activity levels In Canada the timing and duration of the spring thaw directly affects activity levels which reach seasonal lows during the second quarter and build through the third and fourth quarters to a seasonal high in the first quarter  Adverse weather conditions such as hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico may interrupt or curtail our coastal and offshore drilling or our customers operations cause supply disruptions and result in a loss of revenue and damage to our equipment and facilities which may or may not be insured  Severe weather during the winter months normally results in reduced activity levels in the North Sea and Russia generally in the first quarter and may interrupt or curtail our operations or our customers operations in those areas and result in a loss of revenue  Scheduled repair and maintenance of offshore facilities in the North Sea can reduce activity in the second and third quarters  Many of our international oilfield customers increase orders for certain products and services in the fourth quarter  Our process  pipeline business in the DS segment typically experiences lower sales during the first and fourth quarters of the year due to the Northern Hemisphere winter  Our broader DS and TPS businesses typically experiences higher customer activity as a result of spending patterns in the second half of the year Baker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10K  8 RAW MATERIALS We purchase various raw materials and component parts for use in manufacturing our products and delivering our services The principal raw materials we use include steel alloys chromium nickel titanium barite beryllium copper lead tungsten carbide synthetic and natural diamonds gels sand and other proppants printed circuit boards and other electronic components and hydrocarbonbased chemical feed stocks Raw materials that are essential to our business are normally readily available from multiple sources but may be subject to price volatility Market conditions can trigger constraints in the supply of certain raw materials and we are always seeking ways to ensure the availability and manage the cost of raw materials Our procurement department uses its size and buying power to enhance its access to key materials at competitive prices In addition to raw materials and component parts we also use the products and services of metal fabricators machine shops foundries forge shops assembly operations contract manufacturers logistics providers packagers indirect material providers and others in order to produce and deliver products to customers These materials and services are generally available from multiple sources EMPLOYEES As of December 31 2019  we had approximately 68000 employees of which the majority are outside the US Approximately 10 of these employees are represented under collective bargaining agreements or similartype labor arrangements ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS We are committed to the health and safety of people protection of the environment and compliance with environmental laws regulations and our policies Our past and present operations include activities that are subject to extensive domestic including US federal state and local and international regulations with regard to air land and water quality and other environmental matters Regulations continue to evolve and changes in standards of enforcement of existing regulations as well as the enactment of new legislation may require us and our customers to modify supplement or replace equipment or facilities or to change or discontinue present methods of operation Our environmental compliance expenditures and our capital costs for environmental control equipment may change accordingly We recognize that environmental challenges including climate change warrant meaningful action In 2019 we announced our commitment to reduce our carbon equivalent emissions 50 by 2030 and achieve net zero by 2050 This goal encompasses emissions from our direct operations Scope 1 and 2 emissions as compared to our baseline year of 2012 and was set to align with the Paris Accord and the specific recommendations of the United Nations UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Changes Special Report on Global Warming of 15 o C We have proactively worked to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions over the last decade and continue efforts to reduce our overall environmental footprint by using materials wisely and preserving land water and air quality Our sustainability commitments include our formal participation in the UN Global Compact which commenced in 2019 and requires annual communication of progress This Compact requires commitment to the UN Sustainable Development Goals and ten principles including a precautionary approach to environmental challenges initiatives to promote a greater sense of environmental responsibility and the development of environmentally friendly technologies While we seek to embed and verify sound environmental practices throughout our business we are and may in the future be involved in voluntary remediation projects at current and former properties typically related to historical operations On rare occasions our remediation activities are conducted as specified by a government agencyissued consent decree or agreed order Remediation costs at these properties are accrued using currently available facts existing environmental permits technology and presently enacted laws and regulations For sites where we are primarily responsible for the remediation our cost estimates are developed based on internal evaluations and are not discounted We record accruals when it is probable that we will be obligated to pay amounts for environmental site evaluation remediation or related activities and such amounts can be reasonably estimated Accruals are recorded even if significant uncertainties exist over the ultimate cost of the remediation Ongoing environmental compliance costs such as obtaining environmental permits installation and maintenance of pollution control equipment and waste disposal are expensed as incurred Baker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10K  9 The Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act known as Superfund imposes liability for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment Superfund liability is imposed without regard to fault even if the waste disposal was in compliance with laws and regulations We have been identified as a potentially responsible party PRP at various Superfund sites and we accrue our share of the estimated remediation costs for the site PRPs in Superfund actions have joint and several liability and may be required to pay more than their proportional share of such costs In some cases it is not possible to quantify our ultimate exposure because the projects are either in the investigative or early remediation stage or superfund allocation information is not yet available Based upon current information we believe that our overall compliance with environmental regulations including remediation obligations environmental compliance costs and capital expenditures for environmental control equipment will not have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position because we have either established adequate reserves or our compliance cost based on available information is not expected to be material to our consolidated and combined financial statements Our total accrual for environmental remediation was 82 million and 84 million at December 31 2019 and 2018  respectively We continue to focus on reducing future environmental liabilities by maintaining appropriate Company standards and by improving our assurance programs AVAILABILITY OF

consider all of the risk factors described below as well as other information included and incorporated by reference in this annual report There may be additional risks uncertainties and matters not listed below that we are unaware of or that we currently consider immaterial Any of these may adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows and thus the value of an investment in the Company Risk Factors Related to Our Business We operate in a highly competitive environment which may adversely affect our ability to succeed We operate in a highly competitive environment for marketing oilfield products and services and securing equipment and trained personnel Our ability to continually provide competitive products and services can impact our ability to defend maintain or increase prices for our products and services maintain market share and negotiate acceptable contract terms with our customers In order to be competitive we must provide new technologies reliable products and services that perform as expected and that create value for our customers and successfully recruit train and retain competent personnel In addition our investments in new technologies and properties plants and equipment may not provide competitive returns Our ability to defend maintain or increase prices for our products and services is in part dependent on the industrys capacity relative to customer demand and on our ability to differentiate the value delivered by our products and services from our competitors products and services Managing development of competitive technology and new product introductions on a forecasted schedule and at a forecasted cost can impact our financial results If we are unable to continue to develop and produce competitive technology or deliver it to our clients in a timely and costcompetitive manner in various markets in which we operate or if competing technology accelerates the obsolescence of any of our products or services any competitive advantage that we may hold and in turn our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected We are also developing artificial intelligence products and services with a third party There are no assurances that we will be able to successfully develop an artificial intelligence platform that will effectively address the artificial intelligence related needs of our customers In addition the agreement with the third party is subject to term limitations and there are no assurances that a future agreement if any will have the same terms as the current agreement The high cost or unavailability of infrastructure materials equipment supplies and personnel could adversely affect our ability to execute our operations on a timely basis Our manufacturing operations are dependent on having sufficient raw materials component parts and manufacturing capacity available to meet our manufacturing plans at a reasonable cost while minimizing inventories Our ability to effectively manage our manufacturing operations and meet these goals can have an impact on our business including our ability to meet our manufacturing plans and revenue goals control costs and avoid shortages or oversupply of raw materials and component parts People are a key resource to developing manufacturing and delivering our products and services to our customers around the world Our ability to manage the recruiting training retention and efficient usage of the highly skilled workforce required by our plans and to manage the associated costs could impact our business A welltrained motivated workforce has a positive impact on our ability to attract and retain business Periods of rapid growth present a challenge to us and our industry to recruit train and retain our employees while also managing the impact of wage inflation and the limited available qualified labor in the markets where we operate Baker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10K  12 Our business could be impacted by geopolitical and terrorism threats in countries where we or our customers do business and our business operations may be impacted by civil unrest government expropriations andor epidemic outbreaks Geopolitical and terrorism risks continue to grow in a number of key countries where we currently or may in the future do business Geopolitical and terrorism risks could lead to among other things a loss of our investment in the country impairment of the safety of our employees and impairment of our or our customers ability to conduct operations In addition to other geopolitical and terrorism risks civil unrest continues to grow in a number of key countries where we do business Our ability to conduct business operations may be impacted by that civil unrest and our assets in these countries may also be subject to expropriation by governments or other parties involved in civil unrest Epidemic outbreaks may also impact our business operations by among other things restricting travel to protect the health and welfare of our employees and decisions by our customers to curtail or stop operations in impacted areas Compliance with and changes in laws could be costly and could affect operating results In addition government disruptions could negatively impact our ability to conduct our business We have operations in the United States and in more than 120 countries that can be impacted by expected and unexpected changes in the legal and business environments in which we operate Compliancerelated issues could also limit our ability to do business in certain countries and impact our earnings Changes that could impact the legal environment include new legislation new regulations new policies investigations and legal proceedings and new interpretations of existing legal rules and regulations in particular changes in export control laws or exchange control laws additional restrictions on doing business in countries subject to sanctions and changes in laws in countries where we operate In addition changes and uncertainty in the political environments in which our businesses operate can have a material effect on the laws rules and regulations that affect our operations Government disruptions may also delay or halt the granting and renewal of permits licenses and other items required by us and our customers to conduct our business The continued success of our global business and operations depends in part on our ability to continue to anticipate and effectively manage these and other political legal and regulatory risks Increased cybersecurity requirements vulnerabilities threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose risks to our systems networks products solutions services and data Increased global cybersecurity vulnerabilities threats and more sophisticated and targeted cyberrelated attacks pose risks to our systems networks products solutions services and data Cybersecurity attacks also pose risks to our customers partners suppliers and thirdparty service providers products systems and networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of our and our customers data While we attempt to mitigate these risks we remain vulnerable to additional known or unknown threats Given our global footprint the large number of customers with which we do business and the increasing sophistication of cyber attacks a cyber attack could occur and persist for an extended period of time without detection We expect that any investigation of a cyber attack would be inherently unpredictable and that it would take time before the completion of any investigation and before there is availability of full and reliable information During such time we would not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated all or any of which would further increase the costs and consequences of a cyber attack We also may have access to sensitive confidential or personal data or information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws regulations and customerimposed controls Despite our efforts to protect sensitive confidential or personal data or information we may be vulnerable to material security breaches theft misplaced or lost data programming errors employee errors andor malfeasance that could potentially lead to the compromising of sensitive confidential or personal data or information improper use of our systems software solutions or networks unauthorized access use disclosure modification or destruction of information defective products production downtimes and operational disruptions In addition a cyberrelated attack could adversely impact our operating results and result in other negative consequences including damage to our reputation or competitiveness remediation or increased protection costs litigation or regulatory action fines and penalties Baker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10K  13 Our failure to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act FCPA and other similar laws could have a negative impact on our ongoing operations Our ability to comply with the FCPA the UK Bribery Act and various other antibribery and anticorruption laws depends on the success of our ongoing compliance program including our ability to successfully manage our agents distributors and other business partners and supervise train and retain competent employees We could be subject to sanctions and civil and criminal prosecution as well as fines and penalties in the event of a finding of a violation of any of these laws by us or any of our employees Antimoney laundering and antiterrorism financing laws could have significant adverse consequences for us We maintain an enterprisewide program designed to enable us to comply with all applicable antimoney laundering and antiterrorism financing laws and regulations including the Bank Secrecy Act and the Patriot Act This program includes policies procedures processes and other internal controls designed to identify monitor manage and mitigate the risk of money laundering or terrorist financing posed by our products services customers and geographic locale These controls establish procedures and processes to detect and report suspicious transactions perform customer due diligence respond to requests from law enforcement and meet all recordkeeping and reporting requirements related to particular transactions involving currency or monetary instruments We cannot be sure our programs and controls are or will remain effective to ensure our compliance with all applicable antimoney laundering and antiterrorism financing laws and regulations and our failure to comply could subject us to significant sanctions fines penalties and reputational harm all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition Changes in tax laws tax rates tariffs adverse positions taken by taxing authorities and tax audits could impact operating results Changes in tax laws tax rates tariffs changes in interpretation of tax laws the resolution of tax assessments or audits by various tax authorities and the ability to fully utilize tax loss carryforwards and tax credits could impact our operating results including additional valuation allowances for deferred tax assets In addition we may periodically restructure our legal entity organization If taxing authorities were to disagree with our tax positions in connection with any such restructurings our effective tax rate could be materially impacted Our operations involve a variety of operating hazards and risks that could cause losses The products that we manufacture and the services that we provide are complex and the failure of our equipment to operate properly or to meet specifications may greatly increase our customers costs In addition many of these products are used in inherently hazardous industries such as the offshore oilfield business These hazards include blowouts explosions nuclearrelated events fires collisions capsizings and severe weather conditions We may incur substantial liabilities or losses as a result of these hazards Our insurance and contractual indemnity protection may not be sufficient or effective to protect us under all circumstances or against all risks The occurrence of a significant event against which we were not fully insured or indemnified or the failure of a customer to meet its indemnification obligations to us could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition Compliance with and rulings and litigation in connection with environmental and climate change regulations and the environmental and climate change impacts of our or our customers operations may adversely affect our business and operating results We and our business are impacted by material changes in environmental laws regulations rulings and litigation Our expectations regarding our compliance with environmental laws and regulations and our expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations including without limitation our capital expenditures for environmental control equipment are only our forecasts regarding these matters These forecasts may be substantially different from actual results which may be affected by factors such as changes in law that impose restrictions on air emissions wastewater management waste disposal hydraulic fracturing or wetland and land use practices more stringent enforcement of existing environmental laws and regulations a change in our share of any remediation costs or other unexpected adverse outcomes with respect to sites where we have been named as a potentially responsible party including without limitation Superfund sites the discovery of other sites where additional expenditures may be required to comply with environmental legal obligations and the accidental discharge of hazardous materials Baker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10K  14 International national and state governments and agencies continue to evaluate and promulgate legislation and regulations that are focused on restricting emissions commonly referred to as greenhouse gas GHG emissions In the United States the US Environmental Protection Agency EPA has taken steps to regulate GHG emissions as air pollutants under the US Clean Air Act of 1970 as amended The EPAs Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule requires monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from among others certain mobile and stationary GHG emission sources in the oil and natural gas industry which in turn may include data from certain of our wellsite equipment and operations In addition the US government has proposed rules in the past setting GHG emission standards for or otherwise aimed at reducing GHG emissions from the oil and natural gas industry Caps or fees on carbon emissions including in the United States have been and may continue to be established and the cost of such caps or fees could disproportionately affect the fossilfuel energy sector We are unable to predict whether and when the proposed changes in laws or regulations ultimately will occur or what they ultimately will require and accordingly we are unable to assess the potential financial or operational impact they may have on our business Other developments focused on restricting GHG emissions include the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change which includes the Paris Agreement and the Kyoto Protocol the European Union Emission Trading System Article 8 of the European Union Energy Efficiency Directive and the United Kingdoms Energy Savings Opportunity SchemeESOS and in the United States the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative the Western Climate Action Initiative and various state programs implementing the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 known as Assembly Bill 32 The potential for climate related changes may pose future risks to our operations and those of our customers These changes can include extreme variability in weather patterns such as increased frequency of severe weather rising mean temperature and sea levels and longterm changes in precipitation patterns Such changes have the potential to affect business continuity and operating results particularly at facilities in coastal areas Regulatory requirements related to Environmental Social and Governance ESG or sustainability reporting have been issued in the European Union that applies to financial market participants with implementation and enforcement expected in 2021 In the United States such regulations have been issued related to pension investments in California and for the responsible investment of public funds in Illinois Additional regulation is pending in other states We expect regulatory requirements related to ESG matters to continue to expand globally The Company is committed to transparent and comprehensive reporting of our sustainability performance and considers existing standards such as the Global Reporting Initiatives G4 guidelines the Sustainability Accounting Standards Boards documentation International Petroleum Industry Environmental Conservation Associations IPIECA Sustainability Reporting Guidance and recommendations issued by the Task Force for Climate Related Financial Disclosures If we are not able to meet future sustainability reporting requirements of regulators or current and future expectations of investors customers or other stakeholders our business and ability to raise capital may be adversely affected Uninsured claims and litigation against us could adversely impact our operating results We could be impacted by the outcome of pending litigation as well as unexpected litigation or proceedings While we have insurance coverage against operating hazards including product liability claims and personal injury claims related to our products to the extent deemed prudent by our management and to the extent insurance is available no assurance can be given that the nature and amount of that insurance will be sufficient to fully indemnify us against liabilities arising out of pending and future claims and litigation Control of oil and natural gas reserves by stateowned oil companies may impact the demand for our services and products and create additional risks in our operations Much of the worlds oil and natural gas reserves are controlled by stateowned oil companies Stateowned oil companies may require their contractors to meet local content requirements or other local standards such as conducting our operations through joint ventures with local partners that could be difficult or undesirable for us to meet The failure to meet the local content requirements and other local standards may adversely impact our operations in those countries In addition our ability to work with stateowned oil companies is subject to our ability to negotiate and agree upon acceptable contract terms Baker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10K  15 Providing services on an integrated or turnkey basis could require us to assume additional risks We may enter into integrated contracts or turnkey contracts with our customers and we may choose to provide services outside our core business Providing services on an integrated or turnkey basis may subject us to additional risks such as costs associated with unexpected delays or difficulties in drilling or completion operations and risks associated with subcontracting arrangements Some of our customers require bids in the form of fixed pricing contracts Some of our customers require bids for contracts in the form of fixed pricing contracts that may require us to provide integrated project management services outside our normal discrete business and to act as project managers as well as service providers and may require us to assume additional risks associated with cost overruns We sometimes enter into consortium or similar arrangements for certain projects which could impose additional costs and obligations on us We sometimes enter into consortium or similar arrangements for certain projects Under such arrangements each party is responsible for performing a certain scope of work within the total scope of the contracted work and the obligations expire when all contractual obligations are completed The failure or inability financially or otherwise of any of the parties to perform their obligations could impose additional costs and obligations on us These factors could result in unanticipated costs to complete the project liquidated damages or contract disputes The credit risks of having a concentrated customer base in the energy industry could result in losses Having a concentration of customers in the energy industry may impact our overall exposure to credit risk as our customers may be similarly affected by prolonged changes in economic and industry conditions Some of our customers may experience extreme financial distress as a result of falling commodity prices and may be forced to seek protection under applicable bankruptcy laws which may affect our ability to recover any amounts due from such customers Furthermore countries that rely heavily upon income from hydrocarbon exports have been and may in the future be negatively and significantly affected by a drop in oil prices which could affect our ability to collect from our customers in these countries particularly national oil companies Laws in some jurisdictions in which we will operate could make collection difficult or time consuming We will perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and do not expect to require collateral in support of our trade receivables While we maintain reserves for potential credit losses we cannot assure such reserves will be sufficient to meet writeoffs of uncollectible receivables or that our losses from such receivables will be consistent with our expectations Additionally in the event of a bankruptcy of any of our customers we may be treated as an unsecured creditor and may collect substantially less or none of the amounts owed to us by such customer Our Remaining Performance Obligations RPO are subject to modification termination or reduction of orders which could negatively impact our sales Our RPO is comprised of unfilled customer orders for products and product services expected life of contract sales for product services Our RPO can be significantly affected by the timing of orders for large projects Although modifications and terminations of orders may be partially offset by cancellation fees customers can and sometimes do terminate or modify orders Our failure to replace canceled orders could negatively impact our sales and results of operations The total dollar amount of the Companys RPO as of December 31 2019 was 229 billion  We may not be able to satisfy technical requirements testing requirements or other specifications required under our service contracts and equipment purchase agreements Our products are used in deepwater and other harsh environments and severe service applications Our contracts with customers and customer requests for bids typically set forth detailed specifications or technical requirements for our products and services which may also include extensive testing requirements We anticipate that such testing requirements will become more common in our contracts In addition recent scrutiny of the offshore drilling industry has resulted in more stringent technical specifications for our products and more comprehensive testing requirements for our products to ensure compliance with such specifications We cannot provide assurance that our products will be able to satisfy the specifications or that we will be able to perform the Baker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10K  16 fullscale testing necessary to prove that the product specifications are satisfied in future contract bids or under existing contracts or that the costs of modifications to our products to satisfy the specifications and testing will not adversely affect our results of operations Currency fluctuations or devaluations may impact our operating results Fluctuations or devaluations in foreign currencies relative to the US dollar can impact our revenue and our costs of doing business as well as the costs of doing business of our customers Changes in economic andor market conditions may impact our ability to borrow andor cost of borrowing The condition of the capital markets and equity markets in general can affect the price of our common stock and our ability to obtain financing if necessary If our credit rating is ever downgraded it could increase borrowing costs under credit facilities and commercial paper programs as well as increase the cost of renewing or obtaining or make it more difficult to renew obtain or issue new debt financing An inability to obtain maintain protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business There can be no assurance that the steps we take to obtain maintain protect and enforce our intellectual property rights will be completely adequate Our intellectual property rights may fail to provide us with significant competitive advantages particularly in foreign jurisdictions where we have not invested in an intellectual property portfolio or that do not have or do not enforce strong intellectual property rights The weakening of protection of our trademarks patents and other intellectual property rights could also adversely affect our business We are a party to a number of licenses that give us rights to intellectual property that is necessary or useful to our business Our success depends in part on the ability of our licensors to obtain maintain protect and sufficiently enforce the licensed intellectual property rights we have commercialized Without protection for the intellectual property rights we license other companies might be able to offer substantially identical products for sale which could adversely affect our competitive business position and harm our business products Also there can be no assurances that we will be able to obtain or renew from third parties the licenses to use intellectual property rights we need in the future and there is no assurance that such licenses can be obtained on reasonable terms We would be adversely affected in the event that any such license agreement was terminated without the right for us to continue using the licensed intellectual property We may be subject to litigation if another party claims that we have infringed upon misappropriated or otherwise violated its intellectual property rights The tools techniques methodologies programs and components we use to provide our products and services may infringe upon misappropriate or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of others or be challenged on that basis Regardless of the merits any such claims may result in significant legal and other costs and may distract management from running our core business Resolving such claims could increase our costs including through royalty payments to acquire licenses if available from third parties and through the development of replacement technologies If a license to resolve a claim were not available we might not be able to continue providing a particular service or product which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows The effects of Brexit may have a negative impact on our financial results and operations of the business United Kingdom has exited Brexit the European Union EU on January 31 2020 As per the terms of the exit the UK has ceased to be an EU member but will continue to follow its rules and contribute to its budget for an 11 month transition period ending December 31 2020 The purpose of the transition period is to give time for the UK and EU to negotiate their future relationship including a trade deal There remains significant uncertainty on the outcome of the negotiations and the terms of a future trade deal if any This uncertainty could harm our business and financial results due to fluctuations in the value of the British pound versus the US dollar euro and other currencies In addition Brexit could result in delayed deliveries which may impact our internal supply chain and our customer projects Baker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10K  17 Risk Factors Related to the Worldwide Oil and Natural Gas Industry Volatility of oil and natural gas prices can adversely affect demand for our products and services Prices of oil and gas products are set on a commodity basis As a result the volatility in oil and natural gas prices can impact our customers activity levels and spending for our products and services Current energy prices are important contributors to cash flow for our customers and their ability to fund exploration and development activities Expectations about future prices and price volatility are important for determining future spending levels Demand for oil and natural gas is subject to factors beyond our control which may adversely affect our operating results Changes in the global economy could impact our customers spending levels and our revenue and operating results Demand for oil and natural gas as well as the demand for our services and products is highly correlated with global economic growth A prolonged reduction in oil and natural gas prices may require us to record additional asset impairments Such a potential impairment charge could have a material adverse impact on our operating results Requirements and voluntary initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as well as increased climate change awareness are likely to result in increased costs for the oil and gas industry to curb greenhouse gas emissions and could have an adverse impact on demand for oil and natural gas International national and state governments agencies and bodies continue to evaluate and promulgate regulations and voluntary initiatives that are focused on restricting GHG emissions These requirements and initiatives are likely to become more stringent over time and to result in increased costs for the oil and gas industry to curb GHG emissions In addition these developments and public perception relating to climate change may curtail production and demand for hydrocarbons such as oil and natural gas by shifting demand towards and investment in relatively lower carbon energy sources such as wind solar and other renewables The renewable energy industry is developing enhanced technologies and becoming more competitive with fossilfuel energy If renewable energy becomes more competitive than fossilfuel energy particularly during periods of higher oil and natural gas prices it could have a material effect on our results of operations Supply of oil and natural gas is subject to factors beyond our control which may adversely affect our operating results Productive capacity for oil and natural gas is dependent on our customers decisions to develop and produce oil and natural gas reserves and on the regulatory environment in which our customers and we operate The ability to produce oil and natural gas can be affected by the number and productivity of new wells drilled and completed as well as the rate of production and resulting depletion of existing wells Our customers activity levels and spending for our products and services and ability to pay amounts owed us could be impacted by the reduction of their cash flow and the ability of our customers to access equity or credit markets Our customers access to capital is dependent on their ability to access the funds necessary to develop economically attractive projects based upon their expectations of future energy prices required investments and resulting returns Limited access to external sources of funding has caused and may continue to cause customers to reduce their capital spending plans to levels supported by internally generated cash flow In addition a reduction of cash flow resulting from declines in commodity prices a reduction in borrowing bases under reservebased credit facilities or the lack of available debt or equity financing may impact the ability of our customers to pay amounts owed to us and could cause us to increase our reserve for doubtful accounts Seasonal and weather conditions could adversely affect demand for our services and operations Variation from normal weather patterns such as cooler or warmer summers and winters can have a significant impact on demand for our services and operations Adverse weather conditions such as hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico may interrupt or curtail our operations or our customers operations cause supply disruptions and result in a loss of revenue and damage to our equipment and facilities which may or may not be insured For example extreme winter conditions in Canada Russia or the North Sea may interrupt or curtail our operations or our customers operations in those areas and result in a loss of revenue Baker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10K  18 Risk Factors Related to the Separation from GE We may experience challenges relating to the separation from GE and the anticipated benefits from the Master Agreement Framework and the Omnibus Agreement If we experience difficulties with the separation from GE the anticipated benefits of the Master Agreement Framework and the Omnibus Agreement may not be realized fully or at all may take longer to realize than expected or may be offset by the decrease in business from certain customers or other negative impacts The impact of the separation from GE could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or other prospects on an ongoing basis We have incurred and expect to continue to incur additional costs in connection with the separation from GE the Master Agreement Framework and the Omnibus Agreement Actual costs related to the separation and the implementation of the changes contemplated by the Master Agreement Framework and the Omnibus Agreement may be higher than anticipated and we may experience additional difficulties in effecting such changes We are also a party to a number of licenses with GE that give us rights to intellectual property that is necessary or useful to our business We would be adversely affected in the event these agreements were terminated without the right for us to continue accessing and using such licensed intellectual property as we might continue to improve current products and services or develop new ones Although we no longer are a controlled company after the completion of a secondary offering in September 2019 GE and its affiliates continue to own approximately 367 of the voting power of all classes of our outstanding voting stock and the interests of GE may differ from the interests of other stockholders of the Company GE and its affiliates are no longer a majority stockholder after the completion of a secondary offering in September 2019 GE may still exercise significant influence over matters submitted to our stockholders for approval through its ownership of our Class B common stock which at December 31 2019 represented approximately 367 of the voting power of all classes of our outstanding voting stock GE may also have influence over matters that do not require stockholder approval GE may have different interests than other holders of our common stock on these and other matters Among other things GEs influence could delay defer or prevent a sale of the Company that other stockholders support or conversely this influence could result in the consummation of such a transaction that other stockholders do not support This concentrated influence could discourage a potential investor from seeking to acquire Class A common stock and as a result might harm the market price of that Class A common stock In addition pursuant to the provisions set forth in our charter our bylaws and the Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement dated as of November 13 2018 by and between us and GE as amended from time to time the number of individuals who GE is entitled to designate to our board of directors is reduced from five to one GE will continue to be entitled to designate one person for nomination to our board of directors until such time as GE and its affiliates own less than 20 of the voting power of all classes of our outstanding voting stock Although we are no longer controlled by GE our success will remain partially dependent on GE through among other things our reliance on the longterm agreements and transition services agreements between the Company and GE and the public perception of our affiliation with GE Failure of GE to comply with these agreements could have an adverse impact on our business operations The market price of our Class A common stock could be materially impacted due to the substantial number of shares of our capital stock eligible for sale in any future offerings by GE GE and its affiliates beneficially owned assuming full exchange of its shares of Class B common stock pursuant to the Exchange Agreement as of December 31 2019 approximately 367 of our outstanding Class A common stock Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement dated July 31 2019 as further amended from time to time GE has the right to cause us in certain instances at our expense to register resales of our Class A common stock held by GE under the Securities Act These shares also may be sold pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act subject to restrictions while GE is deemed to be our affiliate Future sales of a substantial number of shares of our Class A common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales could occur could substantially decrease the market price of our Class A common stock We cannot assure you if or when any future offerings or resales of these shares may occur Baker Hughes Company 2019 FORM 10K  19 The market price and trading volume of our Class A common stock may be volatile which could result in rapid and substantial losses for our stockholders The market price of our Class A common stock may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations In addition the trading volume in our Class A common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur If the market price of our Class A common stock declines significantly our stockholders may be unable to sell their shares of our Class A common stock at or above their purchase price if at all We cannot assure our stockholders that the market price of our Class A common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future Some of the factors that could negatively affect the price of our Class A common stock or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our Class A common stock include variations in our quarterly operating results failure to meet our earnings estimates publication of research reports about us or our industry or the failure of securities analysts to cover our Class A common stock after the offering additions or departures of our executive officers and other key management personnel adverse market reaction to any indebtedness we may incur or securities we may issue in the future actions by stockholders offerings of our Class A common stock by GE or its affiliates or the perceived possibility of such offerings
