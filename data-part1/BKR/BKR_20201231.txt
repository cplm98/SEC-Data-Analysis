downstream segments including fixedfee or turnkey contracts transactional agreements for products and services and longterm aftermarket service agreements We enjoy stable relationships with many of our customers based on longterm project contracts and master service agreements Several of those contracts require us to commit to a fixed price based on the customers technical specifications with little or no legal relief available due to changes in circumstances such as changes in local laws or industry or geopolitical events In some cases failure to deliver products or perform services within contractual commitments may lead to liquidated damages claims We seek to mitigate these exposures through close collaboration with our customers We strive to negotiate the terms of our customer contracts consistent with what we consider to be industry best practices Our customers typically indemnify us for certain claims arising from the injury or death of their employees and often their contractors the loss of or damage to their facility and equipment and often that of their contractors pollution originating from their equipment or facility and all liabilities related to the well and subsurface operations including loss or damage to the well or reservoir loss of well control fire explosion or any uncontrolled flow of oil or gas Conversely we typically indemnify our customers for certain claims arising from the injury or death of our employees and sometimes that of our subcontractors the loss of or damage to our equipment and pollution originating from our equipment above the surface of the earth while under our control Where the above indemnities do not apply or are not consistent with industry best practices we typically provide a capped indemnity for damages caused to the customer by our negligence and include an overall limitation of liability clause It is also our general practice to include a limitation of liability for consequential loss including loss of profits and loss of revenue in all customer contracts Our indemnity structure may not protect us in every case Certain US states have enacted oil and natural gas specific antiindemnity statutes that can void the allocation of liability agreed to in a contract State law laws in countries outside the US public policy or the negotiated terms of a customer contract may also limit indemnity obligations in the event of the gross negligence or willful misconduct We sometimes contract with customers that are not the end user of our products It is our practice to seek to obtain an indemnity from our customer for any enduser claims but this is not always possible Similarly government agencies and other third parties including in some cases other contractors of our customers may make claims in respect of which we are not indemnified and Baker Hughes Company 2020 FORM 10K  5 for which responsibility is assessed proportionate to fault We have an established process to review any risk deviations from our standard contracting practices The Company maintains a commercial general liability insurance policy program that covers against certain operating hazards including product liability claims and personal injury claims as well as certain limited environmental pollution claims for damage to a third party or its property arising out of contact with pollution for which the Company is liable however clean up and well control costs are not covered by such program All of the insurance policies purchased by the Company are subject to deductible andor selfinsured retention amounts for which we are responsible for payment specific terms conditions limitations and exclusions There can be no assurance that the nature and amount of Company insurance will be sufficient to fully indemnify us against liabilities related to our business ORDERS AND REMAINING PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS Remaining performance obligations RPO a defined term under generally accepted accounting principles GAAP are unfilled customer orders for products and product services excluding any purchase order that provides the customer with the ability to cancel or terminate without incurring a

operations can be affected by seasonal events which can temporarily affect the delivery and performance of our products and services and our customers budgetary cycles Examples of seasonal events that can impact our business are set forth below  Adverse weather conditions such as hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico may interrupt or curtail our coastal and offshore drilling or our customers operations cause supply disruptions and result in a loss of revenue and damage to our equipment and facilities which may or may not be insured Other adverse weather conditions could include extreme heat in the Middle East during the summer months which may impact our operations or our customers operations  The severity and duration of both the summer and the winter in North America can have a significant impact on activity levels In Canada the timing and duration of the spring thaw directly affects activity levels which reach seasonal lows during the second quarter and build through the third and fourth quarters to a seasonal high in the first quarter  Severe weather during the winter months normally results in reduced activity levels in the North Sea and Russia generally in the first quarter and may interrupt or curtail our operations or our customers operations in those areas and result in a loss of revenue  Many of our international oilfield customers may increase activity for certain products and services in the fourth quarter as they seek to fully utilize their annual budgets  Our process  pipeline business in the DS segment typically experiences lower sales during the first and fourth quarters of the year due to the Northern Hemisphere winter  Our broader DS and TPS businesses typically experience higher customer activity as a result of spending patterns in the second half of the year RAW MATERIALS We purchase various raw materials and component parts for use in manufacturing our products and delivering our services The principal raw materials we use include steel alloys chromium nickel titanium barite beryllium copper lead tungsten carbide synthetic and natural diamonds gels sand and other proppants printed circuit boards and other electronic components and

GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION Environmental Matters We are committed to the health and safety of people protection of the environment and compliance with environmental laws regulations and our policies Our past and present operations include activities that are subject to extensive domestic including US federal state and local and international regulations with regard to air land and water quality and other environmental matters Regulations continue to evolve and changes in standards of enforcement of existing regulations as well as the enactment of new legislation may require us and our customers to modify supplement or replace equipment or facilities or to change or discontinue present methods of operation Our environmental compliance expenditures and our capital costs for environmental control equipment may change accordingly We recognize that environmental challenges including climate change warrant meaningful action In 2019 we announced our commitment to reduce our carbon equivalent emissions 50 by 2030 and achieve carbon equivalent net zero emissions by 2050 This goal encompasses emissions from our direct operations Scope 1 and 2 emissions as compared to our baseline year of 2012 and was set to align with the Paris Accord and the specific recommendations of the United Nations UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Changes Special Report on Global Warming of 15 o C We have proactively worked to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions over the last decade and continue efforts to reduce our overall environmental footprint by using materials wisely and preserving land water and air quality Our sustainability commitments include our formal participation in the UN Global Baker Hughes Company 2020 FORM 10K  9 Compact which commenced in 2019 and requires annual communication of progress The UN Global Compact requires commitment to the UN Sustainable Development Goals and ten principles including a precautionary approach to environmental challenges initiatives to promote a greater sense of environmental responsibility and the development of environmentally friendly technologies While we seek to embed and verify sound environmental practices throughout our business we are and may in the future be involved in voluntary remediation projects at current and former properties typically related to historical operations On rare occasions our remediation activities are conducted as specified by a government agencyissued consent decree or agreed order Remediation costs at these properties are accrued using currently available facts existing environmental permits technology and presently enacted laws and regulations For sites where we are primarily responsible for the remediation our cost estimates are developed based on internal evaluations and are not discounted We record accruals when it is probable that we will be obligated to pay amounts for environmental site evaluation remediation or related activities and such amounts can be reasonably estimated Accruals are recorded even if significant uncertainties exist over the ultimate cost of the remediation Ongoing environmental compliance costs such as obtaining environmental permits installation and maintenance of pollution control equipment and waste disposal are expensed as incurred The US Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act known as Superfund imposes liability for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment Superfund liability is imposed without regard to fault even if the waste disposal was in compliance with laws and regulations We have been identified as a potentially responsible party PRP at various Superfund sites and we accrue our share if known of the estimated remediation costs for the site PRPs in Superfund actions have joint and several liability and may be required to pay more than their proportional share of such costs In some cases it is not possible to quantify our ultimate exposure because the projects are either in the investigative or early remediation stage or superfund allocation information is not yet available Based upon current information we believe that our overall compliance with environmental regulations including remediation obligations environmental compliance costs and capital expenditures for environmental control equipment will not have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures earnings or competitive position because we have either established adequate reserves or our compliance cost based on available information is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements Our total accrual for environmental remediation was 78 million and 82 million at December 31 2020 and 2019 respectively We continue to focus on reducing future environmental liabilities by maintaining appropriate Company standards and by improving our environmental assurance programs Other Regulatory Matters We are subject to regulation by various US federal regulatory agencies and by the applicable regulatory authorities in countries in which our products are manufactured and sold Such regulations principally relate to the ingredients

various risks When considering an investment in the Company one should carefully consider all of the risk factors described below as well as other information included and incorporated by reference in this annual report There may be additional risks uncertainties and matters not listed below that we are unaware of or that we currently consider immaterial Any of these may adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows and thus the value of an investment in the Company OPERATIONAL RISKS We operate in a highly competitive environment which may adversely affect our ability to succeed We operate in a highly competitive environment for marketing oilfield products and services and securing equipment Our ability to continually provide competitive products and services can impact our ability to defend maintain or increase prices for our products and services maintain market share and negotiate acceptable contract terms with our customers In order to be competitive we must provide new and differentiating technologies reliable products and services that perform as expected and that create value for our customers In addition our investments in new technologies equipment and facilities may not provide competitive returns Our ability to defend maintain or increase prices for our products and services is in part dependent on the industrys capacity relative to customer demand and on our ability to differentiate the value delivered by our products and services from our competitors products and services Managing development of competitive technology and new product introductions on a forecasted schedule and at a forecasted cost can impact our financial results If we are unable to continue to develop and produce competitive technology or deliver it to our clients in a timely and costcompetitive manner in various markets in which we operate or if competing technology accelerates the obsolescence of any of our products or services any competitive advantage that we may hold and in turn our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected We are also developing artificial intelligence products and services with a third party There are no assurances that we will be able to successfully develop an artificial intelligence platform that will effectively address the artificial intelligence related needs of our customers In addition the agreement with the third party is subject to term limitations and there are no assurances that a future agreement if any will have the same terms as the current agreement Baker Hughes Company 2020 FORM 10K  13 Our business could be adversely affected by the widespread outbreak of a disease or virus The current global spread of the COVID19 virus has and may continue to materially and adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition for an indeterminate amount of time The markets have experienced a decline in oil prices in response to a decline in oil demand due to the economic impacts of the COVID19 pandemic As demand for our products and services declines the utilization of our assets and the prices we are able to charge our customers for our products and services could decline The continued spread of COVID19 or a similar pandemic could result in further instability in the markets and decreases in commodity prices resulting in further adverse impacts on our results of operations cash flows and financial condition In addition the continued spread of the COVID19 virus or similar pandemics and the continuation of the measures to try to contain the virus or similar viruses such as travel bans and restrictions quarantines shelter in place orders and shutdowns may further impact our workforce and operations the operations of our customers and those of our vendors and suppliers Also if a significant number of our employees were to contract the virus or be quarantined the Company may not be able to complete key or critical tasks not limited to but including key financial reporting and operational controls There is considerable uncertainty regarding such measures and potential future measures which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows and financial condition Our restructuring activities may not achieve the results we expect and those activities could increase which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition The restructuring charges we have taken and impairment calculations we have performed are based on current market conditions including the trading price of our common shares There is no assurance that our restructuring plans will be successful and achieve the expected results In addition continued deterioration of market conditions whether due to the continued spread of COVID19 or other events could result in further restructuring costs and impairments Failure to effectively and timely execute our energy transition strategy could have an adverse effect on the demand for our technologies and services Our future success may depend upon our ability to effectively execute on our energy transition strategy Our strategy depends on our ability to develop additional technologies and work with our customers and partners to advance new energy solutions such as carbon capture use and storage hydrogen energy geothermal and other integrated solutions If the energy transition landscape changes faster than anticipated or faster than we can transition or if we fail to execute our energy transition strategy as planned demand for our technologies and services could be adversely effected The high cost or unavailability of raw materials equipment and supplies essential to our business could adversely affect our ability to execute our operations on a timely basis Our manufacturing operations are dependent on having sufficient raw materials component parts and manufacturing capacity available to meet our manufacturing plans at a reasonable cost while minimizing inventories Our ability to effectively manage our manufacturing operations and meet these goals can have an impact on our business including our ability to meet our manufacturing plans and revenue goals control costs and avoid shortages or oversupply of raw materials and component parts If we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel we may not be able to execute our business strategy effectively and our operations could be adversely affected Our future success depends on our ability to recruit train and retain qualified personnel People are a key resource to developing manufacturing and delivering our products and providing technical services to our customers around the world A competent welltrained highly skilled motivated and diverse workforce has a positive impact on our ability to attract and retain business Periods of rapid growth present a challenge to us and our industry to recruit train and retain our employees while also managing the impact of wage inflation and the limited available qualified labor in the markets where we operate Baker Hughes Company 2020 FORM 10K  14 Our business could be impacted by geopolitical and terrorism threats in countries where we or our customers do business and our business operations may be impacted by civil unrest andor government expropriations Geopolitical and terrorism risks continue to grow in a number of key countries where we currently or may in the future do business Geopolitical and terrorism risks could lead to among other things a loss of our investment in the country impairment of the safety of our employees and impairment of our or our customers ability to conduct operations In addition to other geopolitical and terrorism risks civil unrest continues to grow in a number of key countries where we do business Our ability to conduct business operations may be impacted by that civil unrest and our assets in these countries may also be subject to expropriation by governments or other parties involved in civil unrest Control of oil and natural gas reserves by stateowned oil companies may impact the demand for our services and products and create additional risks in our operations  Much of the worlds oil and natural gas reserves are controlled by stateowned oil companies Stateowned oil companies may require their contractors to meet local content requirements or other local standards such as conducting our operations through joint ventures with local partners that could be difficult or undesirable for us to meet The failure to meet the local content requirements and other local standards may adversely impact our operations in those countries In addition our ability to work with stateowned oil companies is subject to our ability to negotiate and agree upon acceptable contract terms Our operations involve a variety of operating hazards and risks that could cause losses The products that we manufacture and the services that we provide are complex and the failure of our equipment to operate properly or to meet specifications may greatly increase our customers costs In addition many of these products are used in inherently hazardous industries such as the offshore oilfield business These hazards include blowouts explosions nuclearrelated events fires collisions capsizings and severe weather conditions We may incur substantial liabilities or losses as a result of these hazards Our insurance and contractual indemnity protection may not be sufficient or effective to protect us under all circumstances or against all risks The occurrence of a significant event against which we were not fully insured or indemnified or the failure of a customer to meet its indemnification obligations to us could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition Seasonal and weather conditions could adversely affect demand for our services and operations Variation from normal weather patterns such as cooler or warmer summers and winters can have a significant impact on demand for our services and operations Adverse weather conditions such as hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico may interrupt or curtail our operations or our customers operations cause supply disruptions and result in a loss of revenue and damage to our equipment and facilities which may or may not be insured For example extreme winter conditions in Canada Russia or the North Sea may interrupt or curtail our operations or our customers operations in those areas and result in a loss of revenue CREDIT AND CUSTOMER CONTRACTING RISKS Providing services on an integrated or turnkey basis could require us to assume additional risks Some of our customers require bids in the form of fixed pricing contracts We may enter into integrated contracts or turnkey contracts with our customers and we may choose to provide services outside our core business Providing services on an integrated or turnkey basis may subject us to additional risks such as costs associated with unexpected delays or difficulties in drilling or completion operations and risks associated with subcontracting arrangements Some of our customers require bids for contracts in the form of fixed pricing contracts that may require us to provide integrated project management services outside our normal discrete business and to act as project Baker Hughes Company 2020 FORM 10K  15 managers as well as service providers and may require us to assume additional risks associated with cost overruns We may not be able to satisfy technical requirements testing requirements or other specifications required under our service contracts and equipment purchase agreements Our products are used in deepwater and other harsh environments and severe service applications Our contracts with customers and customer requests for bids typically set forth detailed specifications or technical requirements for our products and services which may also include extensive testing requirements We anticipate that such testing requirements will become more common in our contracts In addition recent scrutiny of the offshore drilling industry has resulted in more stringent technical specifications for our products and more comprehensive testing requirements for our products to ensure compliance with such specifications We cannot provide assurance that our products will be able to satisfy the specifications or that we will be able to perform the fullscale testing necessary to prove that the product specifications are satisfied in future contract bids or under existing contracts or that the costs of modifications to our products to satisfy the specifications and testing will not adversely affect our results of operations We sometimes enter into consortium or similar arrangements for certain projects which could impose additional costs and obligations on us We sometimes enter into consortium or similar arrangements for certain projects Under such arrangements each party is responsible for performing a certain scope of work within the total scope of the contracted work and the obligations expire when all contractual obligations are completed The failure or inability financially or otherwise of any of the parties to perform their obligations could impose additional costs and obligations on us These factors could result in unanticipated costs to complete the project liquidated damages or contract disputes Our contracts may be terminated early in certain circumstances Our contracts with clients generally may be terminated by the client for convenience default or extended force majeure which could include inability to perform due to COVID19 Termination for convenience will typically require the payment of an early termination fee by the client but the early termination fee may not fully compensate us for the loss of the contract Termination by the client for default or extended force majeure due to events outside of our control generally will not require the client to pay an early termination fee Our financial position results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected if our clients terminate some of our contracts and we are unable to secure new contracts on a timely basis and on substantially similar terms if payments due under our contracts are suspended for an extended period of time or if a number of our contracts are renegotiated Our Remaining Performance Obligation is comprised of unfilled customer orders for products and product services expected life of contract sales for product services The actual amount and timing of revenues earned may be substantially different than the reported RPO The total dollar amount of the Companys RPO as of December 31 2020 was 234 billion The credit risks of having a concentrated customer base in the energy industry could result in losses Having a concentration of customers in the energy industry may impact our overall exposure to credit risk as our customers may be similarly affected by prolonged changes in economic and industry conditions Some of our customers may experience extreme financial distress as a result of falling commodity prices and may be forced to seek protection under applicable bankruptcy laws which may affect our ability to recover any amounts due from such customers Furthermore countries that rely heavily upon income from hydrocarbon exports have been and may in the future be negatively and significantly affected by a drop in oil prices which could affect our ability to collect from our customers in these countries particularly national oil companies Laws in some jurisdictions in which we will operate could make collection difficult or time consuming We will perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and do not expect to require collateral in support of our trade receivables While we maintain reserves for potential credit losses we cannot assure such reserves will be sufficient to meet writeoffs of uncollectible receivables or that our losses from such receivables will be consistent with our expectations Baker Hughes Company 2020 FORM 10K  16 Additionally in the event of a bankruptcy of any of our customers we may be treated as an unsecured creditor and may collect substantially less or none of the amounts owed to us by such customer Our customers activity levels and spending for our products and services and ability to pay amounts owed us could be impacted by the reduction of their cash flow and the ability of our customers to access equity or credit markets Our customers access to capital is dependent on their ability to access the funds necessary to develop economically attractive projects based upon their expectations of future energy prices required investments and resulting returns Limited access to external sources of funding has caused and may continue to cause customers to reduce their capital spending plans to levels supported by internally generated cash flow In addition a reduction of cash flow resulting from declines in commodity prices a reduction in borrowing bases under reservebased credit facilities or the lack of available debt or equity financing may impact the ability of our customers to pay amounts owed to us and could cause us to increase our reserve for credit losses LEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS Compliance with and changes in laws could be costly and could affect operating results In addition government disruptions could negatively impact our ability to conduct our business We have operations in the United States US and in more than 120 countries that can be impacted by expected and unexpected changes in the legal and business environments in which we operate In particular the shipment of goods services and technology across international borders subjects us to extensive trade laws and regulations Our import activities are governed by the unique customs laws and regulations in each of the countries where we operate Pursuant to their laws and regulations governments may impose economic sanctions against certain countries persons and entities that may restrict or prohibit transactions involving such countries persons and entities which may limit or prevent our conduct of business in certain jurisdictions Compliancerelated issues could limit our ability to do business in certain countries and impact our earnings or result in investigations leading to fines penalties or other remedial measures Changes that could impact the legal environment include new legislation new regulations new policies investigations and legal proceedings and new interpretations of existing legal rules and regulations in particular changes in export control laws or exchange control laws additional restrictions on doing business in countries subject to sanctions and changes in laws in countries where we operate In addition changes and uncertainty in the political environments in which our businesses operate can have a material effect on the laws rules and regulations that affect our operations Government disruptions may also delay or halt the granting and renewal of permits licenses and other items required by us and our customers to conduct our business The continued success of our global business and operations depends in part on our ability to continue to anticipate and effectively manage these and other political legal and regulatory risks Our failure to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act FCPA and other similar laws could have a negative impact on our ongoing operations Our ability to comply with the FCPA the UK Bribery Act and various other antibribery and anticorruption laws depends on the success of our ongoing compliance program including our ability to successfully manage our agents distributors and other business partners and supervise train and retain competent employees We could be subject to sanctions and civil and criminal prosecution as well as fines and penalties in the event of a finding of a violation of any of these laws by us or any of our employees Antimoney laundering and antiterrorism financing laws could have adverse consequences for us We maintain an enterprisewide program designed to enable us to comply with all applicable antimoney laundering and antiterrorism financing laws and regulations including the Bank Secrecy Act and the Patriot Act This program includes policies procedures processes and other internal controls designed to identify monitor manage and mitigate the risk of money laundering or terrorist financing posed by our products services customers and geographic locale These controls establish procedures and processes to detect and report suspicious transactions perform customer due diligence respond to requests from law enforcement and meet all recordkeeping and reporting requirements related to particular transactions involving currency or monetary Baker Hughes Company 2020 FORM 10K  17 instruments We cannot be sure our programs and controls are or will remain effective to ensure our compliance with all applicable antimoney laundering and antiterrorism financing laws and regulations and our failure to comply could subject us to significant sanctions fines penalties and reputational harm all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition Changes in tax laws tax rates tariffs adverse positions taken by taxing authorities and tax audits could impact operating results Changes in tax laws tax rates tariffs changes in interpretation of tax laws the resolution of tax assessments or audits by various tax authorities and the ability to fully utilize tax loss carryforwards and tax credits could impact our operating results including additional valuation allowances for deferred tax assets Uninsured claims and litigation against us could adversely impact our operating results We could be impacted by the outcome of pending litigation as well as unexpected litigation or proceedings While we have insurance coverage against operating hazards including product liability claims and personal injury claims related to our products to the extent deemed prudent by our management and to the extent insurance is available no assurance can be given that the nature and amount of that insurance will be sufficient to fully indemnify us against liabilities arising out of pending and future claims and litigation We may be subject to litigation if another party claims that we have infringed upon misappropriated or otherwise violated its intellectual property rights The tools techniques methodologies programs and components we use to provide our products and services may infringe upon misappropriate or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of others or be challenged on that basis Regardless of the merits any such claims may result in significant legal and other costs and may distract management from running our core business Resolving such claims could increase our costs including through royalty payments to acquire licenses if available from third parties and through the development of replacement technologies If a license to resolve a claim were not available we might not be able to continue providing a particular service or product which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows Compliance with and rulings and litigation in connection with environmental regulations and the environmental impacts of our or our customers operations may adversely affect our business and operating results We and our business are impacted by material changes in environmental laws regulations rulings and litigation Our expectations regarding our compliance with environmental laws and regulations and our expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations including without limitation our capital expenditures for environmental control equipment are only our forecasts regarding these matters These forecasts may be substantially different from actual results which may be affected by factors such as changes in law that impose restrictions on air or other emissions wastewater management waste disposal hydraulic fracturing or wetland and land use practices more stringent enforcement of existing environmental laws and regulations a change in our share of any remediation costs or other unexpected adverse outcomes with respect to sites where we have been named as a potentially responsible party including without limitation Superfund sites the discovery of other sites or discovery of additional issues at existing sites where additional expenditures may be required to comply with environmental legal obligations and the accidental discharge of hazardous materials Investor and public perception related to the companys environment social and governance ESG performance as well as current and future ESG reporting requirements may affect our business and our operating results Increasing focus on ESG factors has led to enhanced interest in and review of performance results by investors and other stakeholders and the potential for reputational risk Regulatory requirements related to ESG or sustainability reporting have been issued in the European Union that apply to financial market participants with implementation and enforcement starting in 2021 In the US such regulations have been issued related to pension investments in California and for the responsible investment of public funds in Illinois Additional regulation is pending in other states We expect regulatory requirements related to ESG matters to continue to expand Baker Hughes Company 2020 FORM 10K  18 globally The Company is committed to transparent and comprehensive reporting of our sustainability performance and considers existing standards such as the Global Reporting Initiatives G4 guidelines the Sustainability Accounting Standards Boards documentation International Petroleum Industry Environmental Conservation Associations IPIECA Sustainability Reporting Guidance and recommendations issued by the Financial Stability Boards Task Force for Climaterelated Financial Disclosures and Science Basted Target Initiative If we are not able to meet future sustainability reporting requirements of regulators or current and future expectations of investors customers or other stakeholders our business and ability to raise capital may be adversely affected International national and state governments and agencies continue to evaluate and promulgate legislation and regulations that are focused on restricting greenhouse gas GHG emissions Compliance with climate action regulations applicable to our or our customers operations may have significant implications that could adversely affect our business and operating results in the fossilfuel sectors and boosting demand for technologies contributing to the climate action agenda In the United States the US Environmental Protection Agency EPA has taken steps to regulate GHG emissions as air pollutants under the US Clean Air Act of 1970 as amended The EPAs Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule requires monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from among others certain mobile and stationary GHG emission sources in the oil and natural gas industry which in turn may include data from certain of our wellsite equipment and operations In addition the US government has proposed rules in the past setting GHG emission standards for or otherwise aimed at reducing GHG emissions from the oil and natural gas industry Caps or fees on carbon emissions including in the US have been and may continue to be established and the cost of such caps or fees could disproportionately affect the fossilfuel sectors We are unable to predict whether and when the proposed changes in laws or regulations ultimately will occur or what they ultimately will require and accordingly we are unable to assess the potential financial or operational impact they may have on our business Other developments focused on restricting GHG emissions include the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change which includes implementation of the Paris Agreement and the Kyoto Protocol by the signatories the European Union Emission Trading System Article 8 of the European Union Energy Efficiency Directive and the United Kingdoms Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting SECR the European Commissions proposed carbon border adjustment mechanism CBAM and in the US the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative the Western Climate Action Initiative and various state programs implementing the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 known as Assembly Bill 32 Requirements and voluntary initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as well as increased climate change awareness may result in increased costs for the oil and gas industry to curb greenhouse gas emissions and could have an adverse impact on demand for oil and natural gas International national and state governments agencies and bodies continue to evaluate and promulgate regulations and voluntary initiatives that are focused on restricting GHG emissions These requirements and initiatives are likely to become more stringent over time and to result in increased costs for the oil and gas industry to curb GHG emissions In addition these developments and public perception relating to climate change may curtail production and demand for hydrocarbons such as oil and natural gas by shifting demand towards and investment in relatively lower carbon energy sources such as wind solar and alternative energy solutions If renewable energy becomes more competitive than fossilfuel energy globally it could have a material effect on our results of operations The potential for climate related changes may pose future risks to our operations and those of our customers These changes can include extreme variability in weather patterns such as increased frequency and severity of significant weather events eg flooding hurricanes and tropical storms natural hazards eg increased wildfire risk rising mean temperature and sea levels and longterm changes in precipitation patterns eg drought desertification or poor water quality Such changes have the potential to affect business continuity and operating results particularly at facilities in coastal areas or areas prone to chronic water scarcity Baker Hughes Company 2020 FORM 10K  19 Changes in laws or regulations relating to data privacy and security or any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with such laws or regulations or contractual or other obligations relating to data privacy or security may adversely affect our business and operating results We may have access to sensitive confidential proprietary or personal data or information in certain of our businesses that is or may become subject to various data privacy and security laws regulations standards contractual obligations or customerimposed controls in the jurisdictions in which we operate The legal and regulatory environment related to data privacy and security is increasingly rigorous with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business and enforcement practices are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future These laws and regulations may be interpreted and applied differently over time and from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and it is possible that they will be interpreted and applied in ways that may adversely affect our business and operating results In the US various federal and state regulators including governmental agencies like the Federal Trade Commission have adopted or are considering adopting laws regulations and standards concerning personal information and data security Internationally laws regulations and standards in many jurisdictions apply broadly to the collection use retention security disclosure transfer and other processing of personal information or other data These various and evolving federal state and international laws regulations and standards can differ significantly from one another and given our global footprint this may significantly complicate our compliance efforts and impose considerable costs such as costs related to organizational changes and implementing additional protection technologies which are likely to increase over time In addition compliance with applicable requirements may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies distract management or divert resources from other initiatives and projects all of which could adversely affect our business and operating results Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with any applicable federal state or international laws regulations standards or contractual or other obligations relating to data privacy and security could result in damage to our reputation and our relationship with our customers as well as proceedings or litigation by governmental agencies customers or individuals which could subject us to significant fines sanctions awards penalties or judgments all of which could adversely affect our business and operating results The effects of Brexit may have a negative impact on our financial results and operations of the business The United Kingdom UK exited Brexit the European Union EU on January 31 2020 As per the terms of the exit the UK has ceased to be an EU member but continued to follow its rules and contribute to its budget for an 11 month transition period ending December 31 2020 The purpose of the transition period was to give time for the UK and EU to negotiate their future relationship including a trade deal On December 24 2020 the UK and the EU reached an agreement on the terms of their future cooperation A trade deal was agreed upon and implemented as of December 31 2020 While there remains some uncertainty as to aspects of the relationship not covered by the agreement the major risk of a break in trade between the UK and the EU has now been removed The remaining uncertainty could harm our business and financial results due to fluctuations in the value of the British pound versus the US dollar euro and other currencies and could result in delayed deliveries which may impact our internal supply chain and our customer projects TECHNOLOGY RISKS An inability to obtain maintain protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business There can be no assurance that the steps we take to obtain maintain protect and enforce our intellectual property rights will be completely adequate Our intellectual property rights may fail to provide us with significant competitive advantages particularly in foreign jurisdictions where we have not invested in an intellectual property portfolio or that do not have or do not enforce strong intellectual property rights The weakening of protection of our trademarks patents and other intellectual property rights could also adversely affect our business We are a party to a number of licenses that give us rights to intellectual property that is necessary or useful to our business Our success depends in part on the ability of our licensors to obtain maintain protect and sufficiently enforce the licensed intellectual property rights we have commercialized Without protection for the intellectual property rights we license other companies might be able to offer substantially identical products for sale which could adversely affect our competitive business position and harm our business products Also there can be no Baker Hughes Company 2020 FORM 10K  20 assurances that we will be able to obtain or renew from third parties the licenses to use intellectual property rights we need in the future and there is no assurance that such licenses can be obtained on reasonable terms We would be adversely affected in the event that any such license agreement was terminated without the right for us to continue using the licensed intellectual property Increased cybersecurity vulnerabilities and threats and more sophisticated and targeted cyber attacks and other security incidents pose risks to our systems data and business and our relationships with customers and other third parties In the course of conducting our business we may hold or have access to sensitive confidential proprietary or personal data or information belonging to us our employees or third parties including customers partners or suppliers Increased cybersecurity vulnerabilities and threats and more sophisticated and targeted cyber attacks and other security incidents pose risks to our and our customers partners suppliers and thirdparty service providers systems data and business and the confidentiality availability and integrity of our and our employees and customers data While we attempt to mitigate these risks we remain vulnerable to cyber attacks and other security incidents Given our global footprint the large number of customers partners suppliers and service providers with which we do business and the increasing sophistication and complexity of cyber attacks a cyber attack could occur and persist for an extended period without detection Any investigation of a cyber attack or other security incident would be inherently unpredictable and it would take time before the completion of any investigation and before there is availability of full and reliable information During such time we would not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated all or any of which would further increase the costs and consequences of a cyber attack or other security incident We may be required to expend significant resources to protect against respond to and recover from any cyber attacks and other security incidents As cyber attacks continue to evolve we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities In addition our remediation efforts may not be successful The inability to implement maintain and upgrade adequate safeguards could materially and adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition In addition to our own systems we use thirdparty service providers to process certain data or information on our behalf Due to applicable laws and regulations or contractual obligations we may be held responsible for cybersecurity incidents attributed to our service providers to the extent affecting information

spending levels and our revenue and operating results Demand for oil and natural gas as well as the demand for our services and products is highly correlated with global economic growth A prolonged reduction in oil and natural gas prices may require us to record additional asset impairments Such a potential impairment charge could have a material adverse impact on our operating results Supply of

develop and produce oil and natural gas reserves and on the regulatory environment in which our customers and we operate The ability to produce oil and natural gas can be affected by the number and productivity of new wells drilled and completed as well as the rate of production and resulting depletion of existing wells Currency fluctuations or devaluations may impact our operating results

ownership of our common stock GE may also have influence over matters that do not require stockholder approval GE may have different interests than other holders of our common stock on these and other matters Among other things GEs influence could delay defer or prevent a sale of the Company that other stockholders support or conversely this influence could result in the consummation of such a
