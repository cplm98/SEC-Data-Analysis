extension with an expiry of September 17 2021 3 A patent with this subject matter may be entitled to patent term extension in the United States Competition We operate in a highly competitive environment Our products compete with other products or treatments for diseases for which our products may be indicated Our competitors market products or are actively engaged in research and development RD in areas in which we have products or in which we are developing product candidates or new indications for existing products Our competitive positions may be based on among other things safety efficacy reliability availability patient conveniencedelivery devices price reimbursement access to and timing of market entry and patent position and expiration Certain of the existing patents on our principal products have expired and we face new and increasing competition including from biosimilars We may also compete against biosimilar or generic versions of our competitors products A biosimilar is another version of a biological product for which marketing approval is sought or has been obtained based on a demonstration that it is highly similar to the original reference product See Government Regulation We expect the adverse impact from biosimilars to be more like branded biologics than generic small molecules Although we expect biosimilars to compete on price we believe many patients providers and payers will continue to place high value on the reputation reliability and safety of our products Zarxio   a biosimilar version of NEUPOGEN  from Sandoz a Novartis company Sandoz which launched in the United States in 2015 was the first biosimilar entrant into the US market Companies have pending applications with the FDA for biosimilar versions of EPOGEN  and Neulasta   along with additional biosimilar versions of NEUPOGEN   We are well positioned to compete and will leverage the experience we have had in the United States versus branded competition as well as our considerable experience in competing against epoetin alfa and filgrastim biosimilars in Europe The introduction of new products the development of new processes or technologies by competitors or the emergence of new information about existing products may result in increased competition for our marketed products even for those protected by patents or in reductions in the prices we receive from selling our products In addition the development of new treatment options or standards of care may reduce the use of our products or may limit the utility and application of ongoing clinical trials for our product candidates as used in this document clinical trials may include prospective clinical trials observational studies registries and other studies See Item 1A Risk FactorsOur products face substantial competition and Item 1A Risk FactorsWe currently face competition from biosimilars and expect to face increasing competition in the future 7 The following table reflects our significant

several recently approved products 8 Reimbursement Sales of our principal products are dependent on the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement from thirdparty payers In many markets around the world these payers including government health systems private health insurers and other organizations continue to be focused on reducing the cost of healthcare Their efforts have intensified as a result of rising healthcare costs and economic challenges Drugs and in particular specialty drugs such as our products remain a focus for cost containment by these parties As a result payers around the world are being more restrictive regarding the use of biopharmaceutical products while requiring a higher level of clinical evidence to support the benefit such products bring to patients and the broader healthcare system The scrutiny of biopharmaceutical pricing in the United States remains intense and a point of focus in the discussion of rising healthcare costs The pricing practices of certain companies have increased public media and government scrutiny of the biopharmaceutical industry providing greater incentive for governments and private payers to limit or regulate the price of drug products and services At the same time value assessments of new technology previously used predominantly outside the United States are having an impact in the US healthcare environment Healthcare provider organizations and independent organizations are creating their own value assessments of biopharmaceutical drugs for comparison with manufacturer pricing Although these organizations do not set drug prices they seek to influence pricing as well as payer and provider decision making by publicly disclosing their assessments often making assertions around what they believe to be the appropriate price to charge for a product These developments put greater pressure on access to pricing of and sales of our products In the United States healthcare providers are reimbursed for covered services and products they deliver through Medicare Medicaid and other government healthcare programs as well as through private payers Pharmacies are also reimbursed in a similar manner for drug products they dispense We are required to provide specified rebates or discounts on the products we sell to certain government funded programs including Medicare and Medicaid and those rebates or discounts have increased over time The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ACA enacted in 2010 increased many of the mandatory discounts and rebates required of us and imposed a new Branded Prescription Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Importers fee payable each year by us and other manufacturers The new US presidential administration has identified repealing and replacing the ACA as a priority The timing and method of repeal and replacement legislation is uncertain but changes could include the number of patient lives covered the quality of the insurance Medicaid eligibility and the level of patient protections provided Further efforts by government agencies and state legislatures in the United States could also affect us and our industry For example a recently enacted Vermont law requires manufacturers to submit price increase justifications to the state attorney general if certain price increase and state spending thresholds are met Examples of other proposals that have been discussed and debated but not yet enacted include state ballot initiatives that would place a maximum price ceiling or cap on pharmaceutical products purchased by state agencies and state legislative efforts to cap pharmaceutical prices for commercial payers Other legislative and regulatory actions that would have a significant impact on Amgen include changes to how the Medicare program covers and reimburses current and future drugs including for patients with EndStage Renal Disease changes in the Federal payment rate or new rebate requirements for covered drugs and policies for payment in Medicare or Medicaid and changes to coverage and payment for biosimilars including the current Medicare biosimilar coverage and payment policies intended to encourage biosimilar adoption or other policies that provide easier substitution or reimbursement advantages In the US private sector healthcare providers and payers continue to institute cost reduction and containment measures that lower drug spending altogether or shift a greater portion of the costs to patients Such measures include more limited benefit plan designs higher tier formulary placement that increases the level of patient out of pocket costs and stricter utilization criteria before a patient may get access to a drug In the retail pharmacy sector in which the majority of our sales for ENBREL Sensipar  and Repatha  occur the use of such measures by Pharmacy Benefit Managers PBMs and insurers has continued to intensify which have limited Amgen product usage and revenues PBMs are thirdparty organizations tasked with administrating prescription drug programs for large employers health plans and government programs Consolidation has resulted in a smaller number of PBMs and insurers overseeing a large portion of total covered lives in the United States for example three PBMs oversee approximately 75 of covered lives in the United States As a result PBMs and insurers have greater market power and negotiating leverage to exclude drugs from their formularies in favor of competitor drugs or alternative treatments andor to mandate stricter utilization criteria Formulary exclusion effectively encourages patients and providers to seek alternative treatments or pay 100 of the cost of a drug Recent experience with Repatha  underscores that utilization management requirements continue to be onerous for patients and physicians limiting access to appropriate usage In highly competitive treatment markets such as with ENBREL PBMs are also able to exert negotiating leverage by requiring incremental rebates from manufacturers in order to maintain their formulary position A drugs favorable position on formulary is essential to ensure patients have access In general in countries outside the United States governmentsponsored healthcare systems are the primary payers for drugs and biologics With increased budgetary constraints payers in many countries apply a variety of measures to exert downward price pressure These measures can include mandatory price controls price referencing therapeutic reference pricing increases in mandates or incentives for generic substitution and biosimilar usage and governmentmandated price cuts We expect that 9 countries will continue to take aggressive actions to reduce expenditures on drugs and biologics Similarly fiscal constraints may also impact the extent to which countries are willing to approve new and innovative therapies andor allow access to new technologies For example many Health Technology Assessment HTA organizations use formal economic metrics such as costeffectiveness to determine coverage and reimbursement of new therapies and these organizations are proliferating in established and emerging markets The dynamics and developments discussed above serve to create pressure on the pricing and potential usage of our products and the industry as a whole We remain focused on delivering breakthrough treatments for unmet medical needs Amgen is committed to working with the entire healthcare community to ensure continued innovation and to enable patient access to needed medicines We do this by  investing billions of dollars annually in research and development  developing more affordable therapeutic choices in the form of highquality and reliablysupplied biosimilars  pricing our medicines to reflect the value they provide  partnering with payers to share risk and accountability for health outcomes  providing patient support and education programs and helping patients in financial need access our medicines and  working with policymakers patients and other stakeholders to establish a sustainable healthcare system with access to affordable care and where patients and their healthcare professionals are the primary decision makers See Item 1A Risk FactorsOur sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from thirdparty payers and pricing and reimbursement pressures may affect our profitability and Item 1A Risk FactorsGuidelines and recommendations published by various organizations can reduce the use of our products Manufacturing Distribution and Raw Materials Manufacturing We believe we are a leader in the manufacturing of biologics and that our manufacturing capabilities represent a competitive advantage The products we manufacture consist of both biologics and small molecule drugs The majority of our products are biologics that are produced in living cells and that are inherently complex due to naturallyoccurring molecular variations Highly specialized knowledge and extensive process and product characterization are required to transform laboratoryscale processes into reproducible commercial manufacturing processes For additional information regarding manufacturing facilities see Item 2 Properties We perform most of our bulk manufacturing formulation andor fill and finish activities in our Puerto Rico Rhode Island California and Ireland facilities and also conduct finish activities in the Netherlands In addition we utilize thirdparty contract manufacturers to supplement our commercial manufacturing requirements We manufacture products to support our clinical trials primarily in our California and Rhode Island locations We also utilize thirdparty contract manufacturers for certain clinical products See Item 1A Risk Factors for a discussion of the factors that could adversely impact our manufacturing operations and the global supply of our products Distribution We operate distribution centers in Kentucky California and the Netherlands for worldwide distribution of the majority of our commercial and clinical products We also use thirdparty distributors to supplement distribution of our products worldwide Other In addition to the manufacturing and distribution activities noted above our operations in the United States the US territory of Puerto Rico and the Netherlands include key manufacturing support functions including quality control process development procurement production scheduling and warehousing Certain of those manufacturing and distribution activities are highly regulated by the FDA as well as other international regulatory agencies See Government RegulationRegulation in the United StatesRegulation of Manufacturing Standards 10 Manufacturing Initiatives We have multiple ongoing initiatives that are designed to extend our manufacturing advantage by optimizing our manufacturing network andor mitigating manufacturing risks while continuing to ensure adequate supply of our products We have initiated the bulk process qualification campaign to facilitate licensure at our biologics manufacturing facility in Singapore Upon licensure this facility will expand our capability to manufacture cell culture products utilizing new technology and innovation The facility will be fully reconfigurable providing efficient manufacturing capabilities to help ensure supply of our products worldwide Our first product to be manufactured in the facility will be denosumab We are also constructing an additional new facility at the site in Singapore to enable the manufacture of the active pharmaceutical ingredient for KYPROLIS   In addition to these initiatives we have projects designed to optimize manufacturing asset utilization to continue our use of thirdparty contract manufacturers and to maintain a state of regulatory compliance This includes manufacturing network consolidation initiatives as well as process improvements surrounding manufacturing See Item 1A Risk FactorsManufacturing difficulties disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales Raw Materials and Medical Devices Certain raw materials medical devices including companion diagnostics and components necessary for the commercial andor clinical manufacturing of our products are provided by and are the proprietary products of unaffiliated thirdparty suppliers certain of which may be our only sources for such materials We currently attempt to manage the risk associated with such suppliers by inventory management relationship management and evaluation of alternative sources when feasible We also monitor the financial condition of certain suppliers and their ability to supply our needs See Item 1A Risk FactorsWe rely on thirdparty suppliers for certain of our raw materials medical devices and components We perform various procedures to assist us in authenticating the source of raw materials including intermediary materials used in the manufacture of our products which include verification of the country of origin The procedures are incorporated into the manufacturing processes we and our thirdparty contract manufacturers perform Government Regulation Regulation by government authorities in the United States and other countries is a significant factor in the production and marketing of our products and our ongoing RD activities In order to clinically test manufacture and market products for therapeutic use we must satisfy mandatory procedures and safety and effectiveness standards established by various regulatory bodies Compliance with these standards is complex and failure to comply with any of these standards can result in significant implications See Item 1A Risk Factors for a discussion of factors that can adversely impact our development and marketing of commercial products including global regulatory implications Regulation in the United States In the United States the Public Health Service Act the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act FDCA and the regulations promulgated thereunder as well as other federal and state statutes and regulations govern among other things the production research development testing manufacture quality control labeling storage record keeping approval advertising and promotion and distribution of our products as well as the reporting of certain payments and other transfers of value to healthcare professionals and teaching hospitals Clinical Development and Product Approval Drug development in our industry is complex challenging and risky and failure rates are high Product development cycles are typically very longapproximately 10 to 15 years from discovery to market A potential new medicine must undergo many years of preclinical and clinical testing to establish its safety and efficacy for use in humans at appropriate dosing levels and with an acceptable riskbenefit profile After laboratory analysis and preclinical testing in animals we file an Investigational New Drug Application IND with the FDA to begin human testing Typically we undertake an FDAdesignated threephase human clinical testing program  In phase 1 we conduct small clinical trials to investigate the safety and proper dose ranges of our product candidates in a small number of human subjects  In phase 2 we conduct clinical trials to investigate side effect profiles and the efficacy of our product candidates in a large number of patients who have the disease or condition under study  In phase 3 we conduct clinical trials to investigate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in a large number of patients who have the disease or condition under study The FDA monitors the progress of each trial conducted under an IND and may at its discretion reevaluate alter suspend or terminate the testing based on the data accumulated to that point and the FDAs riskbenefit assessment with regard to the 11 patients enrolled in the trial The results of preclinical and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA in the form of a BLA for biologic products or an NDA for small molecule products We are not permitted to market or promote a new product until the FDA has approved our marketing application Approval of Biosimilars  The ACA authorized the FDA to approve biosimilars via a separate abbreviated pathway The pathway allows sponsors of a biosimilar to seek and obtain regulatory approval based in part on the nonclinical and clinical trial data of an originator product to which the biosimilar has been demonstrated to be highly similar and to have no clinically meaningful differences in terms of safety purity and potency The relevance of demonstrating similarity is that in many cases biosimilars can be brought to market without conducting the full suite of clinical trials typically required of originators as riskbenefit has previously been established In order to preserve incentives for future innovation the law establishes a period of exclusivity for originators products which in general prohibits biosimilars from gaining FDA approval based in part on reliance on or reference to the originators data in their application to the FDA for 12 years after FDA approval of the originator product The law does not change the duration of patents granted on biologic products The FDA has released a number of guidance documents as part of the implementation of the abbreviated approval pathway for biosimilars some of which remain in draft form As of the end of 2016 four biosimilar applications have been approved by the FDA including AMJEVITA   A number of manufacturers have announced the filing of marketing applications to the FDA under the biosimilar pathway some of which are for biosimilars of our products Regulation of Product Marketing and Promotion  The FDA regulates the marketing and promotion of products Our product promotion for approved product indications must comply with the statutory standards of the FDCA and the FDAs implementing regulations and standards The FDAs review of marketing and promotional activities encompasses but is not limited to directtoconsumer advertising healthcare providerdirected advertising and promotion sales representative communications to healthcare professionals promotional programming and promotional activities involving electronic media The FDA may also review industrysponsored scientific and educational activities that make representations regarding product safety or efficacy in a promotional context The FDA may take enforcement action against a company for promoting unapproved uses of a product or for other violations of its advertising and labeling laws and regulations Enforcement action may include product seizures injunctions civil or criminal penalties or regulatory letters which may require corrective advertising or other corrective communications to healthcare professionals Failure to comply with the FDAs regulations also can result in adverse publicity or increased scrutiny of company activities by the US Congress or other legislators Additionally as described below such failure may lead to additional liability under US health care fraud and abuse laws Regulation of Manufacturing Standards  The FDA regulates and inspects equipment facilities laboratories and processes used in the manufacturing and testing of products prior to providing approval to market products If after receiving approval from the FDA we make a material change in manufacturing equipment location or process additional regulatory review may be required We also must adhere to current Good Manufacturing Practice regulations and productspecific regulations enforced by the FDA through its facilities inspection program The FDA conducts regular periodic visits to reinspect our equipment facilities laboratories and processes following an initial approval Regulation of Combination Products  Combination products are defined by the FDA to include products composed of two or more regulated components eg a biologic andor drug and a device BiologicsDrugs and devices each have their own regulatory requirements and combination products may have additional requirements A number of our marketed products meet this definition and are regulated under this framework and we expect that a number of our pipeline product candidates will be evaluated for regulatory approval under this framework as well Regulation Outside the United States In the European Union EU countries as well as Switzerland Canada Australia and Japan  regulatory requirements and approval processes are similar in principle to those in the United States In the EU there are currently two potential tracks for seeking marketing approval for a product which is not authorized in any Member State a decentralized procedure and a centralized procedure In the decentralized procedure identical applications for marketing authorization are submitted simultaneously to the national regulatory agencies Regulatory review is led by one Member State the Reference Member State and its assessment  based on safety quality and efficacy  is reviewed and approved assuming there are no concerns that the product poses a serious risk to public health by the other Member States from which the applicant is seeking approval the Concerned Member States The decentralized procedure leads to a series of single national approvals in all relevant countries In the centralized procedure which is required of all products derived from biotechnology a company submits a single MAA to the EMA which conducts an evaluation of the dossier drawing upon its scientific resources across Europe If the drug product is proven to fulfill the requirements for quality safety and efficacy the EMAs CHMP adopts a positive opinion which is transmitted to the EC for final decision on grant of the marketing authorization While the EC generally follows the CHMP  s opinion it is not bound to do so Subsequent commercialization is enabled by countrybycountry reimbursement approval 12 In the EU biosimilars are approved under a specialized pathway of the centralized procedure As with the US pathway applicants seek and obtain regulatory approval for a biosimilar once the data exclusivity period for the original reference product has expired relying in part on the data submitted for the originator product together with data evidencing that the biosimilar is highly similar in terms of quality safety and efficacy to the original reference product authorized in the European Economic Area Other countries such as Russia Turkey and those in Latin America and the Middle East have review processes and data requirements similar to those of the EU and in some cases rely on prior marketing approval from US or EU regulatory authorities The regulatory process in these countries may include manufacturingtesting facility inspections testing of drug product upon importation and other domestic requirements In Asia Pacific a number of countries such as China Japan South Korea and Taiwan may require local clinical trial data for bridging purposes as part of the drug registration process in addition to global clinical trials which can add to overall drug development and registration timelines In most of the Asian markets registration timelines depend on marketing approval in the United States or the EU In some markets in Asia such as China Thailand and Indonesia the regulatory timelines can be less predictable The regulatory process may also include manufacturingtesting facility inspections testing of drug product upon importation and other domestic requirements Countries such as Australia and Japan have more mature systems that would allow for submissions in more competitive timeframes Regarding biosimilars several of these countries have pathways to register biosimilars eg South Korea India Australia Singapore and Taiwan and biosimilar products are already present on the markets eg Australia and South Korea In some countries such as Japan and those in the EU medical devices may be subject to regulatory regimes whereby the manufacturer must establish that its medical device conforms to essential requirements set out in the law for the particular device category For example in the EU with limited exceptions medical devices placed on the market must bear the Conformit Europenne marking to indicate their conformity with legal requirements Postapproval Phase After approval we continue to monitor adverse events reported following the use of our products through post marketing routine pharmacovigilance surveillance and studies when applicable We report such events to the appropriate regulatory agencies as required per local regulations for individual cases and aggregate reports We proactively monitor according to good pharmacovigilance practices and ensure implementation of signal detection assessment and the communication of adverse events that may be associated with the use of our products We may also be required by regulatory agencies to conduct further clinical trials on our marketed products as a condition of their approval or to provide additional information on safety and efficacy Health authorities including the FDA have authority to mandate labeling changes to products at any point in a products lifecycle based on new safety information or as part of an evolving label change to a particular class of products Health authorities including the FDA also have the authority before or after approval to require companies to implement a risk management program for a product to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks Each risk management program is unique and varies depending on the specific factors required In the United States a risk management program is known as a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy REMS and we currently have REMS for Prolia   Nplate  and BLINCYTO   as well as for our erythropoiesisstimulating agents ESAs which includes EPOGEN  and Aranesp   Other Regulation We are also subject to various laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse including antikickback laws and false claims laws Antikickback laws make it illegal to solicit offer receive or pay any remuneration in exchange for or to induce the referral of business including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug that is reimbursed by a state or federal program False claims laws prohibit knowingly and willingly presenting or causing to be presented for payment to thirdparty payers including Medicare and Medicaid any claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent claims for items or services not provided as claimed or claims for medically unnecessary items or services Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal andor civil sanctions including fines and civil monetary penalties as well as by the possibility of exclusion from federal healthcare programs including Medicare and Medicaid Liability under the false claims laws may also arise when a violation of certain laws or regulations related to the underlying products eg violations regarding improper promotional activity or unlawful payments contributes to the submission of a false claim In 2012 Amgen announced it had finalized a settlement agreement with the US government and various other parties regarding allegations that Amgens promotional contracting sales and marketing activities and arrangements caused the submission of various false claims under the Federal Civil False Claims Act and various State False Claims Acts In connection with entering into the settlement agreement Amgen also entered into a corporate integrity agreement with the Office of Inspector General OIG of the US Department of Health and Human Services that requires Amgen to maintain its corporate compliance program and to undertake a set of defined corporate integrity obligations for a period of five years Due to the breadth of the 13 statutory provisions and the absence of guidance in the form of regulations or court decisions addressing some of our practices it is possible that in the future our practices might be further challenged under antikickback or similar laws Additionally the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act FCPA prohibits US corporations and their representatives from offering promising authorizing or making payments to any foreign government official government staff member political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad The scope of the FCPA includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries Other countries have enacted similar anticorruption laws andor regulations Our business has been and will continue to be subject to various other US and foreign laws rules andor regulations Research and Development and Selected Product Candidates We focus our RD on novel human therapeutics for the treatment of serious illness in the areas of oncologyhematology cardiovascular disease inflammation bone health nephrology and neuroscience We take a modalityindependent approach to RD with a focus on biologics We use cuttingedge science and technology to study the subtle biological mechanisms in search of therapies that will improve the lives of those who suffer from diseases Our discovery research programs may therefore yield targets that lead to the development of human therapeutics delivered as large molecules small molecules or other combination or new modalities Human genetic validation is used whenever possible to enhance the likelihood of success For the years ended December 31 2016  2015 and 2014  our RD expenses were 38 billion  41 billion and 43 billion  respectively We have major RD centers in several locations throughout the United States including Thousand Oaks and San Francisco California and Cambridge Massachusetts in Iceland and in the United Kingdom as well as smaller research centers and development facilities globally See Item 2 Properties We conduct clinical trial activities by using both our internal staff and thirdparty contract clinical trial service providers To increase the number of patients available for enrollment in our clinical trials we have opened clinical sites and will continue opening clinical sites and enrolling patients in a number of geographic locations See Government RegulationClinical Development and Product Approval for a discussion of government regulation over clinical development Also see Item 1A Risk FactorsWe must conduct clinical trials in humans before we can commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications Some of our competitors are actively engaged in RD in areas where we have products or where we are developing product candidates or new indications for existing products For example we compete with other clinical trials for eligible patients which may limit the number of available patients who meet the criteria for certain clinical trials The competitive marketplace for our product candidates is significantly dependent on the timing of entry into the market Early entry may have important advantages in gaining product acceptance thereby contributing to a products eventual success and profitability Accordingly we expect that in some cases the relative speed with which we can develop products complete clinical testing receive regulatory approval and supply commercial quantities of a product to the market will be important to our competitive position In addition to product candidates and marketed products generated from our internal RD efforts we acquire companies acquire and license certain product and RD technology rights and establish RD arrangements with third parties to enhance our strategic position within our industry by strengthening and diversifying our RD capabilities product pipeline and marketed product base In pursuing these RD arrangements and licensing or acquisition activities we face competition from other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that also seek to license or acquire technologies product candidates or marketed products from those entities performing the RD The following table is a selection of certain of our product candidates by phase of development in our therapeutic areas of focus as of February 13 2017 unless otherwise indicated Additional product candidate information can be found on our website at wwwamgencom The website address is not intended to function as a hyperlink and the information contained on our website is not intended to be a part of this filing The information in this section does not include other nonregistrational clinical trials that we may conduct for purposes other than for submission to regulatory agencies for their approval of a new product indication We may conduct nonregistrational clinical trials for various reasons including to evaluate realworld outcomes or to collect additional safety information with the use of our products In addition the table does not

that are based on current expectations estimates forecasts and projections about us our future performance our business our beliefs and our managements assumptions The statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties our business faces The risks described below are not the only ones we face Our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies such as employment relations general economic conditions geopolitical events and international operations Further additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may in the future materially and adversely affect our business operations liquidity and stock price 21 Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from thirdparty payers and pricing and reimbursement pressures may affect our profitability Sales of our products depend on the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement from thirdparty payers including government healthcare programs and private insurance plans Governments and private payers continue to pursue aggressive initiatives to contain costs and manage drug utilization and are increasingly focused on the effectiveness benefits and costs of similar treatments which could result in lower reimbursement rates for our products or narrower populations for whom our products will be reimbursed by payers Public scrutiny of the price of drugs and other healthcare costs is increasing and greater focus on pricing and price increases may limit our ability to set or increase the price of our products based on their value which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales business and results of operations A substantial portion of our US business relies on reimbursement from US federal government healthcare programs and private insurance plans regulated by the US federal government See Item 1 BusinessReimbursement Changes to US federal reimbursement policy may come through legislative actions US President Donald Trump and other US lawmakers have made statements about potentially repealing andor replacing the ACA although specific legislation for such a repeal or replacement has not yet been introduced While we are unable to predict what changes may ultimately be enacted to the extent that future changes affect how our products are paid for and reimbursed by government and private payers our business could be adversely impacted For example discussions continue about proposals that would allow the US federal government to directly negotiate drug prices with pharmaceutical manufacturers or require manufacturers to pay higher rebates in the Medicare Part D setting Changes in US federal reimbursement policy may also arise as a result of regulations or demonstration projects implemented by the Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services CMS the federal agency responsible for administering Medicare Medicaid and the Health Insurance Marketplaces CMS has substantial power to quickly implement policy changes that can significantly affect how our products are covered and reimbursed State government actions or ballot initiatives can also affect how our products are covered and reimbursed or create additional pressure on how our products are priced Many states have discussed and debated and are considering new pricing legislation including state proposals designed to require biopharmaceutical manufacturers to publicly report proprietary pricing information or to place a maximum price ceiling or cap on pharmaceutical products purchased by state agencies For example Ohio voters are expected to consider in their November 2017 election a ballot proposition that would prohibit the state from paying a greater price for drugs than the lowest price paid by the US Department of Veterans Affairs Passage of this proposition could lead to the introduction of additional ballot initiatives in other states Legislative or regulatory changes or other government initiatives that decrease the coverage or reimbursement available for our products require that we pay increased rebates limit our ability to offer copay payment assistance to commercial patients or limit the pricing of pharmaceutical products could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations Payers including healthcare insurers PBMs and group purchasing organizations increasingly seek price discounts or rebates in connection with the placement of our products on their formularies or those they manage Consolidation in the health insurance industry has resulted in a few large insurers and PBMs exerting greater pressure in pricing and usage negotiations with drug manufacturers significantly increasing such discounts and rebates and limiting patient access and usage Three PBMs currently oversee approximately 75 of total covered lives in the United States Payers continue to adopt benefit plan changes that shift a greater portion of prescription costs to patients and some payers may attempt to limit the use of programs assisting commercial patients with their copayments Payers also control costs by imposing restrictions on access to our products such as by requiring prior authorizations or step therapy and may choose to exclude certain indications for which our products are approved or even choose to exclude coverage entirely For example since the launch of Repatha  in August 2015 the application of utilization management criteria by some payers including PBMs has resulted in denials of coverage for a significant number of patients for whom Repatha  has been prescribed slowing Repatha  sales In early February 2017 we announced that our phase 3 outcomes study evaluating the ability of Repatha  to prevent cardiovascular events met its primary composite endpoint and key secondary composite endpoint See Item 1 BusinessSignificant Developments However in the current competitive environment the application of restrictive utilization management criteria by some payers may continue until the clinical data is reflected in approved product labeling or even thereafter Ultimately further discounts rebates coverage or plan changes restrictions or exclusions as described above could have a material adverse effect on sales of our affected products We also face risks relating to the reporting of pricing data that affects the reimbursement of and discounts provided for our products to US government healthcare programs Pricing data that we submit impacts the payment rates for providers rebates we pay and discounts we are required to provide under Medicare Medicaid and other government drug programs Government price reporting regulations are complex and may require a manufacturer to update certain previously submitted data Our price reporting data calculations are reviewed monthly and quarterly and based on such reviews we have on occasion restated previously reported pricing data to reflect changes in calculation methodology reasonable assumptions andor underlying data If our submitted pricing data are incorrect we may become subject to substantial fines and penalties or other government enforcement actions which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations In addition as a result of restating previously reported price data we also may be required to pay additional rebates and provide additional discounts 22 Outside the United States we expect countries will continue to take aggressive actions to reduce their healthcare expenditures See Item 1 BusinessReimbursement For example international reference pricing IRP is widely used by a large number of countries to control costs based on an external benchmark of a products price in other countries IRP policies can quickly and frequently change and may not reflect differences in the burden of disease indications market structures or affordability differences across countries or regions Any deterioration in the coverage and reimbursement available for our products or in the timeliness or certainty of payment by payers to physicians and other providers could negatively impact the ability or willingness of healthcare providers to prescribe our products for their patients or could otherwise negatively affect the use of our products or the prices we receive for them Such changes could have a material adverse effect on our product sales business and results of operations Our products face substantial competition We operate in a highly competitive environment See Item 1 BusinessMarketing Distribution and Selected Marketed ProductsCompetition We expect that our products will compete with new drugs currently in development drugs currently approved for other indications that may later be approved for the same indications as those of our products and drugs approved for other indications that are used offlabel Large pharmaceutical companies and generics manufacturers of pharmaceutical products are expanding into the biotechnology field and some pharmaceutical companies and generics manufacturers have formed partnerships to pursue biosimilars In addition some of our competitors may have technical competitive or other advantages over us for the development of technologies and processes or greater experience in particular therapeutic areas and consolidation among pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can enhance such advantages These advantages may make it difficult for us to compete with them to successfully discover develop and market new products and for our current products to compete with new products or new product indications they may bring to market As a result our products may compete against products that have lower prices equivalent or superior performance better safety profiles easier administration earlier market availability or other competitive features If we are unable to compete effectively this could reduce sales which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations We currently face competition from biosimilars and expect to face increasing competition in the future We currently face competition from biosimilars in both Europe and the United States and we expect to face increasing biosimilar competition in the next year and beyond Expiration or successful challenge of applicable patent rights could accelerate such competition and we could face more litigation regarding the validity andor scope of our patents Our products may also experience greater competition from lowercost biosimilars or generics that come to market when branded products that compete with our products lose their own patent protection To the extent that governments adopt more permissive approval frameworks and competitors are able to obtain broader or expedited marketing approval for biosimilars the rate of increased competition for our products could accelerate In the EU biosimilars are evaluated and authorized pursuant to a set of general and product classspecific guidelines In addition in an effort to spur biosimilar utilization andor increase potential healthcare savings some EU countries have adopted or are attempting to adopt biosimilar uptake measures such as requiring physician prescribing quotas or promoting switching or pharmacy substitution of biosimilars for the corresponding reference products and other countries may adopt similar measures Some EU countries may impose automatic price reductions upon market entry of the second or third biosimilar competitor In the United States the ACA authorized the FDA to approve biosimilars via a separate abbreviated pathway See Item 1 BusinessGovernment RegulationRegulation in the United StatesApproval of Biosimilars The first biosimilar entrant into the US market Sandozs Zarxio   is a biosimilar version of NEUPOGEN   and was launched in the United States in 2015 Since then the FDA has approved additional biosimilars including a biosimilar version of ENBREL In addition a growing number of companies have announced that they are in varying stages of development of biosimilar versions of existing biotechnology products including biosimilars that would compete with our products Companies pursuing development of biosimilar versions of our products have challenged and may continue to challenge our patents well in advance of the expiration of our material patents For information related to our biosimilars patent litigation including our litigation regarding ENBREL see Part IVNote 18 Contingencies and commitments to the Consolidated Financial Statements See also Our intellectual property positions may be challenged invalidated or circumvented or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation The US pathway includes the option for biosimilar products that meet certain criteria to be approved as interchangeable with their reference products Some companies currently developing biosimilars may seek to register their products as interchangeable biologics which could make it easier for pharmacists to substitute those biosimilars for our products or could encourage prescribers who are inclined to select the interchangeable biosimilar over our innovative products In addition critics of the 12year exclusivity period in the biosimilar pathway law will likely continue to seek to shorten the data exclusivity period andor to encourage the FDA to interpret narrowly the laws provisions regarding which new products receive data exclusivity which could expose us to biosimilar competition at an earlier time While we are unable to predict the precise impact of biosimilars on our products we are currently facing and expect to face greater competition in the United States and Europe in the next year and beyond as a result of biosimilars and downward pressure on our product prices and sales This biosimilar competition has had and could increasingly have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 23 Our current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval Our business is subject to extensive regulation by numerous state and federal government authorities in the United States including the FDA and by foreign regulatory authorities including the EMA We are required in the United States and in foreign countries to obtain approval from regulatory authorities before we manufacture market and sell our products Once our products are approved the FDA and other US and foreign regulatory agencies have substantial authority to require additional testing and reporting perform inspections change product labeling or mandate withdrawals of our products Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may subject us to administrative andor judicially imposed sanctions or monetary penalties as well as reputational and other harms The sanctions could include the FDAs or foreign regulatory authorities refusals to approve pending applications delays in obtaining or withdrawals of approvals delays or suspensions of clinical trials warning letters product recalls or seizures total or partial suspensions of our operations injunctions fines civil penalties andor criminal prosecutions Obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval have been and will continue to be increasingly difficult timeconsuming and costly Legislative bodies or regulatory agencies could enact new laws or regulations change existing laws or regulations or change their interpretations of laws or regulations at any time which could affect our ability to obtain or maintain approval of our products or product candidates The rate and degree of change in existing laws and regulations and regulatory expectations have accelerated in established markets and regulatory expectations continue to evolve in emerging markets We are unable to predict whether and when any further changes to laws or regulatory policies affecting our business could occur such as changes to regulations governing manufacturer communications concerning drug products and drug product candidates and whether such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations Regulatory authorities may also question the sufficiency for approval of the endpoints we select for our clinical trials A number of our products and product candidates have been evaluated in clinical trials using surrogate endpoints that measure an effect that is known to correlate with an ultimate clinical endpoint For example a therapeutic oncology product candidate may be evaluated for its ability to extend the length of time during and after the treatment that a patient lives without the disease worsening PFS Demonstrating that the product candidate produces a statistically significant improvement in PFS does not necessarily mean that the product candidate will show a statistically significant improvement in overall survival or the time that the patients remain alive In the cardiovascular setting a heart disease therapeutic candidate may be evaluated for its ability to reduce LDLC levels as elevated LDLC level has been a surrogate endpoint for cardiovascular events such as death heart attack and stroke The use of surrogate endpoints such as PFS and LDLC reduction in the absence of other measures of clinical benefit may not be sufficient for broad usage or approval even when such results are statistically significant Regulatory authorities could also add new requirements such as the completion of enrollment in a confirmatory study or the completion of an outcomes study or a meaningful portion of an outcomes study as conditions for obtaining approval or obtaining an indication For example our initial FDA application for Repatha  sought approval for a broader patient population based on data demonstrating that Repatha  reduced LDLC levels However the FDA ultimately approved Repatha  only for a subset of those patients citing among other things the absence of positive outcomes data showing that Repatha  prevents cardiovascular events We subsequently announced that our phase 3 outcomes study evaluating the ability of Repatha  to prevent cardiovascular events met its primary composite endpoint and key secondary composite endpoint See Item 1 BusinessSignificant Developments However we cannot predict the degree to which the results of this study will be incorporated into the Repatha  label by regulators There may also be situations in which demonstrating the efficacy and safety of a product candidate may not be sufficient to gain regulatory approval unless superiority to comparative products can be shown The imposition of additional requirements or our inability to meet them in a timely fashion or at all may delay our clinical development and regulatory filing efforts delay or prevent us from obtaining regulatory approval for new product candidates or new indications for existing products or prevent us from maintaining our current labels Some of our products have been approved by US and foreign regulatory authorities on a conditional basis with full approval conditioned upon fulfilling the requirements of regulators For example in December 2014 we received accelerated approval for BLINCYTO  for the treatment of patients with Ph relapsed or refractory Bcell precursor ALL in the United States with continued approval contingent upon clinical benefit in subsequent trials BLINCYTO  also received conditional marketing authorization for the treatment of patients with Ph relapsed or refractory Bcell precursor ALL from the EC in November 2015 Regulatory authorities are placing greater focus on monitoring products originally approved on an accelerated or conditional basis and on whether the sponsors of such products have met the conditions of the accelerated or conditional approvals If we are unable to fulfill the regulators requirements that were conditions of a products accelerated or conditional approval andor if regulators reevaluate the data or riskbenefit profile of our product the conditional approval may not result in full approval or may be revoked or not renewed Alternatively we may be required to change the products labeled indications or even withdraw the product from the market Safety problems or signals can arise as our products and product candidates are evaluated in clinical trials including investigator sponsored studies or as our marketed products are used in clinical practice We are required to continuously collect and assess adverse events reported to us and to communicate to regulatory agencies these adverse events and safety signals regarding 24 our products Regulatory agencies periodically perform inspections of our pharmacovigilance processes including our adverse event reporting In 2012 pharmacovigilance legislation became effective in the EU that enhanced the authority of European regulators to require companies to conduct additional postapproval clinical efficacy and safety studies and increased the requirements on sponsor companies to analyze and evaluate the riskbenefit profiles of their products Similarly for our products with approved REMS see Item 1 BusinessGovernment RegulationPostApproval Phase we are required to submit periodic assessment reports to the FDA to demonstrate that the goals of the REMS are being met REMS and other risk management programs are designed to ensure that a drugs benefits outweigh the risks and vary in the elements they contain For example our ESA REMS requires applicable healthcare providers and institutions to enroll in the program receive education about the product and the REMS and document and report certain information to us over time We are responsible for tracking and documenting certain elements of healthcare provider and institution compliance with the ESA REMS and we use thirdparty service providers to assist in the administration of certain portions of our REMS If the FDA is not satisfied with the results of the periodic assessment reports we submit for any of our REMS the FDA may also modify our REMS or take other regulatory actions such as implementing revised or restrictive labeling If regulatory agencies determine that we or other parties including our clinical trial investigators those operating our patient support programs or licensees of our products have not complied with the applicable reporting or other pharmacovigilance requirements we may become subject to additional inspections warning letters or other enforcement actions including fines marketing authorization withdrawal and other penalties Our product candidates and marketed products can also be affected by safety problems or signals occurring with respect to products that are similar to ours and that implicate an entire class of products Further as a result of clinical trials including subanalyses or metaanalyses of earlier clinical trials a metaanalysis involves the use of various statistical methods to combine results from previous separate but related studies performed by us or others concerns may arise about the sufficiency of the data or studies underlying a products approved label Such actual or perceived safety problems or concerns can lead to  revised or restrictive labeling for our products or the potential for restrictive labeling that may result in our decision not to commercialize a product candidate  requirement of risk management activities or other regulatory agency compliance actions related to the promotion and sale of our products  mandated postmarketing commitments or pharmacovigilance programs for our approved products  product recalls of our approved products  revocation of approval for our products from the market completely or within particular therapeutic areas or patient types  increased timelines or delays in being approved by the FDA or other regulatory bodies andor  fewer treatments or product candidates being approved by regulatory bodies For example since 2006 when adverse safety results involving ESAs were observed ESAs continue to be the subject of ongoing review and scrutiny Reviews by regulatory authorities of the riskbenefit profile of ESAs have resulted in and may continue to result in changes to ESA labeling our ESA REMS and usage in both the oncology and nephrology clinical settings In addition to our innovative products we are working to develop and commercialize biosimilar versions of a number of products currently manufactured marketed and sold by other pharmaceutical companies In some markets there is not yet a legislative or regulatory pathway for the approval of biosimilars In the United States the ACA provided for such a pathway while the FDA continues to implement it questions remain as to the evidence needed to demonstrate biosimilarity or interchangeability for specific products and what information can be included in biosimilar labeling See We currently face competition from biosimilars and expect to face increasing competition in the future Delays or uncertainties in the development of such pathways could result in delays or difficulties in getting our biosimilar products approved by regulatory authorities subject us to unanticipated development costs or otherwise reduce the value of the investments we have made in the biosimilars area Further we cannot predict whether any repeal or reform of the ACA would affect the biosimilar pathway or have a material adverse effect on our development of biosimilars In addition if we are unable to bring our biosimilar products to market on a timely basis and secure firsttomarket positions our future biosimilar sales and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected We may not be able to develop commercial products despite significant investments in RD Amgen invests heavily in RD Successful product development in the biotechnology industry is highly uncertain and very few RD projects produce commercial products Product candidates including biosimilar product candidates or new indications 25 for existing products collectively product candidates that appear promising in the early phases of development may fail to reach the market for a number of reasons such as  the product candidate did not demonstrate acceptable clinical trial results even though it demonstrated positive preclinical trial results for reasons that could include changes in the standard of care of medicine  the product candidate was not effective or not more effective than currently available therapies in treating a specified condition or illness  the product candidate was not cost effective in light of existing therapeutics  the product candidate had harmful side effects in humans or animals  the necessary regulatory bodies such as the FDA or EMA did not approve the product candidate for an intended use  the product candidate was not economical for us to manufacture and commercialize  the biosimilar product candidate failed to demonstrate the requisite biosimilarity to the applicable reference product or was otherwise determined by a regulatory authority to not meet applicable standards for approval  other parties had or may have had proprietary rights relating to our product candidate such as patent rights and did not let us sell it on reasonable terms or at all  we and certain of our licensees partners or independent investigators may have failed to effectively conduct clinical development or clinical manufacturing activities and  the pathway to regulatory approval or reimbursement for product candidates was uncertain or not welldefined A number of our product candidates have failed or been discontinued at various stages in the product development process For example in May 2015 we terminated our participation in the codevelopment and commercialization of brodalumab with AstraZeneca The decision was based on events of suicidal ideation and behavior in the brodalumab program which we believed likely would necessitate restrictive labeling that would limit the appropriate patient population Inability to bring a product to market or a significant delay in the expected approval and related launch date of a new product for any of the reasons discussed could potentially have a negative impact on our product sales and earnings and could result in a significant impairment of inprocess research and development IPRD or other intangible assets We must conduct clinical trials in humans before we commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications Before we sell any products we must conduct clinical trials to demonstrate that our product candidates are safe and effective for use in humans The results of those clinical trials are used as the basis to obtain approval from regulatory authorities such as the FDA and EMA See Our current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval We are required to conduct clinical trials using an appropriate number of trial sites and patients to support the product label claims The length of time number of trial sites and number of patients required for clinical trials vary substantially and therefore we may spend several years and incur substantial expense in completing certain clinical trials In addition we may have difficulty finding a sufficient number of clinical trial sites and patients to participate in our clinical trials particularly if competitors are conducting clinical trials in similar patient populations Patients may withdraw from clinical trials at any time and privacy laws andor other restrictions in certain countries may restrict the ability of clinical trial investigators to conduct further followup on such patients which may adversely affect the interpretation of study results Delays and complications in planned clinical trials can result in increased development costs associated delays in regulatory approvals and in product candidates reaching the market and revisions to existing product labels Further to increase the number of patients available for enrollment in our clinical trials we have and will continue to open clinical sites and enroll patients in a number of locations where our experience conducting clinical trials is limited including Russia India China South Korea the Philippines Singapore and some Central and South American countries either through utilization of thirdparty contract clinical trial providers entirely or in combination with local staff Conducting clinical trials in locations where we have limited experience requires substantial time and resources to understand the unique regulatory environments of individual countries Further we must ensure the timely production distribution and delivery of the clinical supply of our product candidates to numerous and varied clinical trial sites If we fail to adequately manage the design execution and diverse regulatory aspects of our large and complex clinical trials or to manage the production or distribution of our clinical supply corresponding regulatory approvals may be delayed or we may fail to gain approval for our product candidates or could lose our ability to market existing products in certain therapeutic areas or altogether If we are unable to market and sell our products or product candidates or to obtain approvals in the timeframe needed to execute our product strategies our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 26 We rely on independent thirdparty clinical investigators to recruit patients and conduct clinical trials on our behalf in accordance with applicable study protocols laws and regulations Further we rely on unaffiliated thirdparty vendors to perform certain aspects of our clinical trial operations We also may acquire companies that have ongoing clinical trials These trials may not have been conducted to the same standards as ours however once an acquisition has been completed we assume responsibility for the conduct of these trials including any potential risks and liabilities associated with the past and prospective conduct of those trials If regulatory authorities determine that we or others including our licensees or the independent investigators selected by us or by a company we have acquired have not complied with regulations applicable to the clinical trials those authorities may refuse or reject some or all of the clinical trial data or take other actions that could negatively impact our ability to obtain or maintain marketing approval of the product or indication If we were unable to market and sell our products or product candidates our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected In addition some of our clinical trials involve drugs manufactured and marketed by other pharmaceutical companies These drugs may be administered in clinical trials in combination with one of our products or product candidates or in a headtohead study comparing the products or product candidates relative efficacy and safety In the event that any of these vendors or pharmaceutical companies have unforeseen issues that negatively impact the quality of their work or create a shortage of supply or if we are otherwise unable to obtain an adequate supply of these other drugs our ability to complete our applicable clinical trials andor evaluate clinical results may also be negatively impacted As a result this could adversely affect our ability to timely file for gain or maintain regulatory approvals worldwide Clinical trials must be designed based on the current standard of medical care However in certain diseases such as cancer the standard of care is evolving rapidly In such diseases the duration of time needed to complete certain clinical trials may result in the design of such clinical trials being based on standards of medical care that are no longer the current standards by the time such trials are completed limiting the utility and application of such trials We may not obtain favorable clinical trial results and therefore may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for new product candidates or new indications for existing products andor maintain our current product labels Participants in clinical trials of our products and product candidates may also suffer adverse medical events or side effects that could among other factors delay or terminate clinical trial programs andor require additional or longer trials to gain approval Even after a product is on the market safety concerns may require additional or more extensive clinical trials as part of a risk management plan for our product or for approval of a new indication For example in connection with the June 2011 ESA label changes we agreed to conduct additional clinical trials examining the use of ESAs in CKD Additional clinical trials we initiate including those required by the FDA could result in substantial additional expense and the outcomes could result in further label restrictions or the loss of regulatory approval for an approved indication each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations Additionally any negative results from such trials could materially affect the extent of approvals the use reimbursement and sales of our products our business and results of operations Some of our products are used with drug delivery or companion diagnostic devices that have their own regulatory manufacturing and other risks Many of our products and product candidates may be used in combination with a drug delivery device such as an injector or other delivery system In addition Vectibix  is used in combination with a test kit which is a companion diagnostic device and some of our product candidates may also be used in combination with a companion diagnostic device Our product candidates or expanded indications of our products used with such devices may not be approved or may be substantially delayed in receiving regulatory approval if such devices do not also gain or maintain regulatory approval or clearance When approval of the product and device is sought under a single marketing drug application the increased complexity of the review process may delay receipt of regulatory approval In addition some of these devices may be provided by singlesource unaffiliated thirdparty companies We are dependent on the sustained cooperation and effort of those thirdparty companies both to supply the devices and in some cases to conduct the studies required for approval or clearance by the applicable regulatory agencies We are also dependent on those thirdparty companies continuing to meet applicable regulatory or other requirements Failure to successfully develop or supply the devices delays in or failures of the Amgen or thirdparty studies or failure of us or the thirdparty companies to obtain or maintain regulatory approval or clearance of the devices could result in increased development costs delays in or failure to obtain regulatory approval andor associated delays in a product candidate reaching the market or in the addition of new indications for existing products Actual or perceived safety problems or concerns with a device used with our product can lead to regulatory actions and impacts to our products See Our current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval  Loss of regulatory approval or clearance of a device that is used with our product may also result in the removal of our product from the market Further failure to successfully develop supply or gain or maintain approval for these devices could adversely affect sales of the related approved products 27 Our intellectual property positions may be challenged invalidated or circumvented or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and defend patent rights and other intellectual property rights that are important to the commercialization of our products and product candidates The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and often involve complex legal scientific and factual questions Third parties may challenge invalidate or circumvent our patents and patent applications relating to our products product candidates and technologies Challenges to patents may come from potential competitors or from parties other than those who seek to market a potentiallyinfringing product In addition our patent positions might not protect us against competitors with similar products or technologies because competing products or technologies may not infringe our patents For certain of our product candidates there are third parties who have patents or pending patent applications that they may claim necessitate payment of a royalty or prevent us from commercializing these product candidates in certain territories Patent disputes are frequent costly and can preclude delay or increase the cost of commercialization of products We have been in the past and are currently and may be in the future involved in patent litigation These matters have included and may in the future include litigation with manufacturers of products that purport to be biosimilars of certain of our products for patent infringement and for failure to comply with certain provisions of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act including the requirement to provide 180 days notice in advance of commercial marketing A determination made by a court agency or tribunal concerning infringement validity enforceability injunctive or economic remedy or the right to patent protection for example are typically subject to appellate or administrative review Upon review such initial determinations may be afforded little or no deference by the reviewing tribunal and may be affirmed reversed or made the subject of reconsideration through further proceedings A patent dispute or litigation may not discourage a potential violator from bringing the allegedlyinfringing product to market prior to a final resolution of the dispute or litigation The period from inception until resolution of a patent dispute or litigation is subject to the availability and schedule of the court agency or tribunal before which the dispute or litigation is pending We may be subject to competition during this period and may not be able to fully recover from the losses damages and harms we incur from infringement by the competitor product even if we prevail Moreover if we lose or settle current or future litigations at certain stages or entirely we could be subject to competition andor significant liabilities be required to enter into thirdparty licenses for the infringed product or technology or be required to cease using the technology or product in dispute In addition we cannot guarantee that such licenses will be available on terms acceptable to us or at all Further under the HatchWaxman Act our products approved by the FDA under the FDCA may be the subject of patent litigation with generics competitors before expiry of the fiveyear period of data exclusivity provided for under the HatchWaxman Act and prior to the expiration of the patents listed for the product Likewise our innovative biologic products may be the subject of patent litigation prior to the expiration of our patents and with respect to competitors seeking approval as a biosimilar or interchangeable version of our products prior to the 12year exclusivity period provided under the ACA In addition we may face additional patent litigation involving claims that the biosimilar product candidates we are working to develop infringe the patents of other companies that manufacture market or sell the applicable reference products While we may attempt to challenge such patents our efforts may be unsuccessful For information related to our biosimilars patent litigation see Part IVNote 18 Contingencies and commitments to the Consolidated Financial Statements Certain of the existing patents on our products have recently expired See Item 1 BusinessMarketing Distribution and Selected Marketed ProductsPatents As our patents expire competitors are able to legally produce and market similar products or technologies including biosimilars which may have a material adverse effect on our product sales business and results of operations In addition competitors may be able to invalidate design around or otherwise circumvent our patents and sell competing products Guidelines and recommendations published by various organizations can reduce the use of our products Government agencies promulgate regulations and guidelines directly applicable to us and to our products However professional societies practice management groups insurance carriers physicians groups private health and science foundations and organizations involved in various diseases also publish guidelines and recommendations to healthcare providers administrators and payers as well as patient communities Recommendations by government agencies or other groups and organizations may relate to such matters as usage dosage route of administration and use of related therapies and a growing number of organizations are providing assessments of the value and pricing of pharmaceutical products These assessments may come from private organizations such as the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review which publish their findings and offer recommendations relating to the products reimbursement by government and private payers In addition government HTA organizations such as the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence in the United Kingdom and the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health make reimbursement recommendations to payers in their jurisdictions based on the clinical effectiveness costeffectiveness and service impact of new emerging and existing medicines and treatments Such HTA organizations may recommend reimbursement for our product for a narrower indication than was approved by applicable regulatory agencies or may recommend against reimbursement entirely Such recommendations or guidelines may affect our reputation and any 28 recommendations or guidelines that result in decreased use dosage or reimbursement of our products could have a material adverse effect on our product sales business and results of operations In addition the perception by the investment community or stockholders that such recommendations or guidelines will result in decreased use and dosage of our products could adversely affect the market price of our common stock The adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability We are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and other jurisdictions in which we do business As a result our provision for income taxes is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various places we operate Significant judgment is required for determining our provision for income tax Our tax returns are routinely examined by tax authorities in the United States and other jurisdictions in which we do business and a number of audits are currently underway Tax authorities are becoming more aggressive in their audits and are particularly focused on the allocations of income and expense among tax jurisdictions We believe our accrual for income tax liabilities is appropriate based on past experience interpretations of tax law and judgments about potential actions by tax authorities however due to the complexity of the provision for income taxes the ultimate resolution of any tax matters may result in payments greater or less than amounts accrued See Part IVNote 5 Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Our provision for income taxes and results of operations in the future could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure changes in the mix of income and expenses in countries with differing tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in applicable tax laws regulations or administrative interpretations thereof President Trump has indicated that US corporate tax reform is a high priority for his Administration and the US Congress is expected to propose sweeping changes to the US tax system including changes to corporate tax rates the taxation of income earned outside the US including the taxation of previously unrepatriated foreign earnings as well as a potential destinationbased tax system A change to the US tax system a change to the tax system in a jurisdiction where we have significant operations such as the US territory of Puerto Rico or a change in tax law in other jurisdictions where we do business could have a material and adverse effect on our business and on the results of our operations We rely on thirdparty suppliers for certain of our raw materials medical devices and components We rely on unaffiliated thirdparty suppliers for certain raw materials medical devices and components necessary for the manufacturing of our commercial and clinical products Certain of those raw materials medical devices and components are proprietary products of those unaffiliated thirdparty suppliers and are specifically cited in our drug applications with regulatory agencies so that they must be obtained from that specific sole source or sources and could not be obtained from another supplier unless and until the regulatory agency approved such supplier For example Insulet Corporation is our single source of the onbody injector for our Neulasta  Onpro  kit Also certain of the raw materials required in the commercial and clinical manufacturing of our products are sourced from other countries andor derived from biological sources including mammalian tissues bovine serum and human serum albumin Among the reasons we may be unable to obtain these raw materials medical devices and components include  regulatory requirements or action by regulatory agencies or others  adverse financial or other strategic developments at or affecting the supplier including bankruptcy  unexpected demand for or shortage of raw materials medical devices or components  failure to comply with our quality standards which results in quality and product failures product contamination andor recall  a material shortage contamination recall andor restrictions on the use of certain biologically derived substances or other raw materials  discovery of previously unknown or undetected imperfections in raw materials medical devices or components and  labor disputes or shortages including from the effects of health emergencies and natural disasters These events could negatively impact our ability to satisfy demand for our products or conduct clinical trials which could have a material adverse effect on our product use and sales and our business and results of operations For example in prior years we have experienced shortages in certain components necessary for the formulation fill and finish of certain of our products in our Puerto Rico facility Further quality issues that result in unexpected additional demand for certain components may lead to shortages of required raw materials or components such as we have experienced with EPOGEN  glass vials We may experience or continue to experience these or other shortages in the future resulting in delayed shipments supply constraints clinical trial delays contract disputes andor stockouts of our products 29 Manufacturing difficulties disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales Manufacturing biologic human therapeutic products is difficult complex and highly regulated We currently are involved in the manufacture of many of our products and plan to manufacture many of our product candidates In addition we currently use thirdparty contract manufacturers to produce or assist in the production of a number of our products and we currently use contract manufacturers to produce or assist in the production of a number of our latestage product candidates and drug delivery devices See Item 1 BusinessManufacturing Distribution and Raw MaterialsManufacturing Our ability to adequately and timely manufacture and supply our products and product candidates is dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of our facilities and those of our thirdparty contract manufacturers which may be impacted by  capacity of manufacturing facilities  contamination by microorganisms or viruses or foreign particles from the manufacturing process  natural or other disasters including hurricanes earthquakes volcanoes or fires  labor disputes or shortages including the effects of health emergencies or natural disasters  compliance with regulatory requirements  changes in forecasts of future demand  timing and actual number of production runs and production success rates and yields  updates of manufacturing specifications  contractual disputes with our suppliers and contract manufacturers  timing and outcome of product quality testing  power failures andor other utility failures andor  breakdown failure substandard performance or improper installation or operation of equipment If the efficient manufacture and supply of our products or product candidates is interrupted we may experience delayed shipments delays in our clinical trials supply constraints stockouts adverse event trends contract disputes andor recalls of our products From time to time we have initiated voluntary recalls of certain lots of our products For example in July 2014 we initiated a voluntary recall of an Aranesp  lot distributed in the EU after particles were detected in a quality control sample following distribution of that lot If we are at any time unable to provide an uninterrupted supply of our products to patients we may lose patients and physicians may elect to prescribe competing therapeutics instead of our products which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales business and results of operations Our manufacturing processes and those of our thirdparty contract manufacturers must undergo regulatory approval processes and are subject to continued review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities It can take longer than five years to build validate and license another manufacturing plant and it can take longer than three years to qualify and license a new contract manufacturer We have initiated the drug substance process qualification campaign to facilitate licensure at our biologics manufacturing facility in Singapore This Singapore facility will utilize a novel manufacturing technology that has not been previously approved by the FDA or other regulatory authorities In addition we are in the process of commercially validating and licensing a new facility at the site in Singapore to enable the manufacture of the active pharmaceutical ingredient for KYPROLIS   If we are unable to obtain needed licenses for either of these facilities on a timely basis it could adversely affect our ability to achieve our planned risk mitigation and cost reductions which as a result could have a material adverse effect on our product sales business and results of operations If regulatory authorities determine that we or our thirdparty contract manufacturers or certain of our thirdparty service providers have violated regulations or if authorities restrict suspend or revoke our prior approvals they could prohibit us from manufacturing our products or conducting clinical trials or selling our marketed products until we or the affected thirdparty contract manufacturers or thirdparty service providers comply or indefinitely Such issues may also delay the approval of product candidates we have submitted for regulatory review even if such product candidates are not directly related to the products devices or processes at issue with regulators Because our thirdparty contract manufacturers and certain of our thirdparty service providers are subject to the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities alternative qualified thirdparty contract manufacturers and thirdparty service providers may not be available on a timely basis or at all If we or our thirdparty contract manufacturers or thirdparty service providers cease or interrupt production or if our thirdparty contract manufacturers and thirdparty service providers fail to supply materials products or services to us we may experience delayed shipments supply constraints stockouts andor recalls of our products Additionally we distribute a substantial volume of our commercial products through our primary distribution centers in Louisville Kentucky for the United States and in Breda Netherlands for Europe and much of the rest of the world We also conduct all the labeling and packaging of our products distributed in Europe and much of the rest of the world in Breda Our 30 ability to timely supply products is dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operations of our distribution and logistics centers our thirdparty logistics providers and our labeling and packaging facility in Breda Further we rely on commercial transportation including air freight for the distribution of our products to our customers which may be negatively impacted by natural disasters or security threats We perform a substantial majority of our commercial manufacturing activities at our facility in the US territory of Puerto Rico and substantially all of our clinical manufacturing activities at our facility in Thousand Oaks California if significant disruptions or production failures occur at the Puerto Rico facility we may not be able to supply these products or at the Thousand Oaks facility we may not be able to continue our clinical trials We currently perform a substantial majority of our commercial manufacturing activities at our facility in the US territory of Puerto Rico and substantially all of our clinical manufacturing activities at our facility in Thousand Oaks California The global supply of our products and product candidates for commercial sales and for use in our clinical trials is significantly dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of these facilities See Manufacturing difficulties disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales The operation of our manufacturing facility in Puerto Rico is also subject to local economic challenges Since June 2015 when the Governor of Puerto Rico announced that the government including certain government entities was unable to pay its roughly 72 billion in debt the governments liquidity position has continued to deteriorate and public reports indicate that the Puerto Rico government is not making certain payments with respect to its obligations On June 30 2016 President Obama signed into law the Puerto Rico Oversight Management and Economic Stability Act PROMESA to provide a mechanism for Puerto Rico to restructure its debt achieve fiscal responsibility and gain access to capital markets PROMESA established a federal Financial Oversight and Management Board Oversight Board to provide fiscal oversight through the development and approval of fiscal plans and budgets for Puerto Rico and to assist in the debt restructuring The establishment of the Oversight Board initially provided for an automatic stay of creditor actions against the Puerto Rico government until February 15 2017 and recently extended the automatic stay until May 1 2017 The Puerto Rico government is expected to submit a fiscal plan to the Oversight Board by February 28 2017 Additionally on January 29 2017 the Puerto Rico government signed into law the Puerto Rico Fiscal Emergency and Fiscal Responsibility Act the Act which is intended to facilitate and encourage a voluntary negotiation process under PROMESA between the Puerto Rico government and its creditors The Act declares a state of financial emergency in Puerto Rico until May 1 2017 and authorizes the Governor to designate certain services as essential services and other services as nonessential in order to prioritize the use of available resources to satisfy Puerto Ricos obligations While PROMESA and the actions above continue to be important factors in moving Puerto Rico toward economic stability there is still a risk that Puerto Ricos economic situation could impact the territorial governments provision of utilities or other services in Puerto Rico that we use in the operation of our business create the potential for increased taxes or fees to operate in Puerto Rico result in a migration of workers from Puerto Rico to the mainland United States andor make it more expensive or difficult for us to operate in Puerto Rico Concentration of sales at certain of our wholesaler distributors and freestanding dialysis clinic businesses and consolidation of private payers may negatively impact our business Certain of our distributors customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage due to the volume of our products they purchase or the number of patient lives for which they provide coverage The substantial majority of our US product sales is made to three pharmaceutical product wholesaler distributors AmerisourceBergen Corporation McKesson Corporation and Cardinal Health Inc These distributors in turn sell our products to their customers which include physicians or their clinics dialysis centers hospitals and pharmacies One of our products EPOGEN   is sold primarily to freestanding dialysis clinics Two organizations DaVita and Fresenius Medical Care North America own or manage a large number of the outpatient dialysis facilities located in the United States and account for approximately 75 of all EPOGEN  sales Similarly as discussed above there has been significant consolidation in the health insurance industry including that three PBMs now oversee approximately 75 of total covered lives in the United States See Item 1A Risk FactorsOur sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from thirdparty payers and pricing and reimbursement pressures may affect our profitability The concentration of purchasing and negotiating power by these entities may put pressure on our pricing due to their ability to extract price discounts on our products fees for other services or rebates negatively impacting our bargaining position sales andor profit margins In addition decisions by these entities to purchase or cover less or none of our products in favor of competitive products could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations due to their purchasing volume We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us or at all The capital and credit markets may experience extreme volatility and disruption which may lead to uncertainty and liquidity issues for both borrowers and investors We expect to access the capital markets to supplement our existing funds and cash generated from operations in satisfying our needs for working capital capital expenditure and debt service requirements our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock and other business initiatives we plan to strategically pursue including acquisitions and licensing 31 activities In the event of adverse capital and credit market conditions we may be unable to obtain capital market financing on similar favorable terms or at all which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations Changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized creditrating agencies could adversely affect our ability to obtain capital market financing and the cost of such financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities Our efforts to acquire other companies or products and to integrate their operations may not be successful and may result in unanticipated costs delays or failures to realize the benefits of the transactions We have an ongoing process of evaluating potential merger acquisition partnering and inlicense opportunities that we expect will contribute to our future growth and expand our geographic footprint product offerings andor our RD pipeline Acquisitions may result in unanticipated costs delays or other operational or financial problems related to integrating the acquired company and business with our company which may result in the diversion of our managements attention from other business issues and opportunities Failures or difficulties in integrating or retaining new personnel or in integrating the operations of the businesses we acquire including their technology compliance programs distribution and general business operations and procedures while preserving important RD distribution marketing promotion and other relationships may affect our ability to grow and may result in our incurring asset impairment or restructuring charges For example on October 1 2013 we acquired Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc Onyx a biopharmaceutical company with several currently marketed products as well as pipeline candidates progressing through the development process and failures or difficulties in the integration of Onyx could result in a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations Our sales and operations are subject to the risks of doing business in emerging markets As we continue our expansion efforts in emerging markets around the world through acquisitions and licensing transactions as well as through the development and introduction of our products in new markets we face numerous risks to our business There is no guarantee that our efforts and strategies to expand sales in emerging markets will succeed Emerging market countries may be especially vulnerable to periods of global political legal regulatory and financial instability including sovereign debt issues andor the imposition of international sanctions in response to certain state actions As we expand internationally we are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the US dollar While we have a program in place that is designed to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations through foreign currency hedging arrangements our hedging efforts do not completely offset the effect of these fluctuations on our revenues and earnings We may also be required to increase our reliance on thirdparty agents and unfamiliar operations and arrangements previously utilized by companies we partner with or acquire in emerging markets See We must conduct clinical trials in humans before we commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications Our international operations and business may also be subject to less protective intellectual property or other applicable laws diverse data privacy and protection requirements changing tax laws and tariffs farreaching antibribery and anticorruption laws and regulations andor evolving legal and regulatory environments These legal and operational challenges along with government controls the challenges of attracting and retaining qualified personnel and obtaining andor maintaining necessary regulatory or pricing approvals of our products may result in a material adverse impact on our international product sales business and results of operations Our business may be affected by litigation and government investigations We and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in legal proceedings See Part IVNote 18 Contingencies and commitments to the Consolidated Financial Statements Civil and criminal litigation is inherently unpredictable and the outcome can result in costly verdicts fines and penalties exclusion from federal healthcare programs andor injunctive relief that affect how we operate our business Defense of litigation claims can be expensive timeconsuming and distracting and it is possible that we could incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims for monetary damages or change the way we operate our business which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations In addition product liability is a major risk in testing and marketing biotechnology and pharmaceutical products We may face substantial product liability exposure in human clinical trials and for products we sell after regulatory approval Product liability claims regardless of their merits could be costly and divert managements attention and could adversely affect our reputation and the demand for our products We and certain of our subsidiaries have previously been named as defendants in product liability actions for certain of our products We are also involved in government investigations that arise in the ordinary course of our business In recent years there has been a trend of increasing government investigations and litigations against companies operating in our industry both in the United States and around the world Our business activities outside of the United States are subject to the FCPA and similar antibribery or anticorruption laws regulations or rules of other countries in which we operate including the UK Bribery Act As we announced on December 19 2012 we finalized a settlement agreement with the US government and various other parties to settle certain allegations regarding our sales and marketing practices In connection with that settlement we are now operating under a Corporate Integrity Agreement CIA with the OIG of the US Department of Health and Human Services that requires us to maintain our corporate compliance program and to undertake a set of defined corporate integrity obligations until December 2017 The CIA also provides for an independent thirdparty review organization to assess and report on our compliance 32 program While we expect to fully comply with all of our obligations under the CIA failure to do so could result in substantial penalties and our being excluded from government healthcare programs We may also be subject to actions by government entities including those not participating in the settlement and may in the future become subject to claims by other parties in each case with respect to the alleged conduct that is the subject of the settlement We may see new government investigations of or actions against us citing novel theories of recovery Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations We are increasingly dependent on information technology systems infrastructure network connected control systems and data security We are increasingly dependent on information technology systems infrastructure network connected control systems and data security The breadth complexity and business process integration of our computer systems and the potential value of our data make these systems targets of service interruption destruction malicious intrusion and attack Likewise data privacy or security breaches by employees contractors or others may pose risks that sensitive data including intellectual property trade secrets or personal information belonging us our patients customers andor other business partners may be exposed to unauthorized persons or the public As a global biotechnology company our systems are subject to frequent cyberattacks Moreover these attacks are growing in frequency sophistication and intensity and are becoming increasingly difficult to detect As the cyberthreat landscape evolves such attacks are also increasingly difficult to detect when carried out by motivated wellresourced skilled and persistent actors including nation states and organized crime groups Such attacks could include the deployment of harmful malware key loggers a denialofservice a delivery of malware through malicious websites the use of social engineering andor other means to affect the confidentiality integrity and availability of our information technology systems processes infrastructure and data Key business partners thirdparty service and product providers and any companies we may acquire face similar risks and any security breaches of their systems could adversely affect our security and resiliency posture Although in the past we have experienced cyberattacks and intrusions into our computer systems we do not believe such attacks have had a material adverse effect on our operations While we continue to invest in the protection and monitoring of our critical or sensitive data and information technology there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent service interruptions or detect all breaches to our systems that could adversely affect our business and operations andor result in the loss of critical or sensitive information which could result in financial legal business or reputational harm to us Global economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business Our operations and performance have been and may continue to be affected by global economic conditions Financial pressures may cause government or other thirdparty payers to more aggressively seek cost containment measures See Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from thirdparty payers and pricing and reimbursement pressures may affect our profitability As a result of global economic conditions some thirdparty payers may delay or be unable to satisfy their reimbursement obligations Job losses or other economic hardships may also affect patients ability to afford health care as a result of increased copay or deductible obligations greater cost sensitivity to existing copay or deductible obligations lost healthcare insurance coverage or for other reasons We believe such conditions have led and could continue to lead to reduced demand for our products which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales business and results of operations Economic conditions may also adversely affect the ability of our distributors customers and suppliers to obtain the liquidity required to buy inventory or raw materials and to perform their obligations under agreements with us which could disrupt our operations Although we monitor our distributors customers and suppliers financial condition and their liquidity to mitigate our business risks some of our distributors customers and suppliers may become insolvent which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales business and results of operations We maintain a significant portfolio of investments disclosed as cash equivalents and marketable securities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets The value of our investments may be adversely affected by interest rate fluctuations downgrades in credit ratings illiquidity in the capital markets and other factors that may result in otherthantemporary declines in the value of our investments Any of those events could cause us to record impairment charges with respect to our investment portfolio or to realize losses on sales of investments Our stock price is volatile Our stock price like that of our peers in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries is volatile Our revenues and operating results may fluctuate from period to period for a number of reasons Events such as a delay in product development changes to our expectations or strategy or even a relatively small revenue shortfall may cause financial results for a period to be below our expectations or projections As a result our revenues and operating results and in turn our stock price may be subject to significant fluctuations Announcements or discussions of possible restrictive actions by government or private payers that would impact our business or industry if ultimately enacted or adopted may also cause our stock price to fluctuate whether or not such restrictive actions ever actually occur Similarly actual or perceived safety issues with our products or similar products or unexpected clinical trial results can have an immediate and rapid impact on our stock price whether or not our operating results are materially impacted 33 Item 1B UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None Item 2 PROPERTIES As of December 31 2016  we owned or leased approximately 190 properties The locations and primary functions of significant properties are summarized in the following tables Excluded from the tables above are undeveloped land and leased properties that have been abandoned and certain buildings that we still own but are no longer used in our business There are no material encumbrances on our owned properties We believe that our facilities are suitable for their intended use and in conjunction with our thirdparty contracting manufacturing agreements provide adequate capacity and are sufficient to meet our expected needs See Item 1A Risk Factors for a discussion on the factors that could adversely impact our manufacturing operations and the global supply of our products See Item 1
