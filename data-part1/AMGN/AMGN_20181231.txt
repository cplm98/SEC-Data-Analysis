are indicated in disease areas in which other products or treatments are currently available or are being pursued by our competitors through research and development RD activities Additionally some competitormarketed products target the same genetic pathways as our recently launched marketed products or are being pursued currently This competition could impact the pricing and market share of our products We continue to pursue ways to increase the value of our medicines through innovations during their life cycles which can include expanding the disease areas for which our products are indicated and finding new methods to make the delivery of our medicines easier and less costly Such activities can offer important opportunities for differentiation For example in 2015 we launched the Neulasta  Onpro  kit which provides physicians the opportunity to initiate the administration of the recommended dose of Neulasta  on the same day as chemotherapy with drug delivery at home the day after chemotherapy thereby saving patients a trip back to the doctor We also launched in 2017 the AutoTouch  reusable autoinjector to be used with Enbrel Mini  singledose prefilled cartridges 50 mgmL The Enbrel Mini  utilizes a new drug formulation of ENBREL that was associated with statistically significant lower mean injection site pain than the current formulation We plan to continue pursuing innovation efforts to strengthen our competitive position Such position may be based on among other things safety efficacy reliability availability patient conveniencedelivery devices price reimbursement access to and timing of market entry and patent position and expiration Certain of the existing patents on our principal products have expired and we face new and increasing competition including from biosimilars and generics We may also compete against biosimilar or generic versions of our competitors products A biosimilar is another version of a biological product for which marketing approval is sought or has been obtained based on a demonstration that it is highly similar to the original reference product We expect that the adverse impact on our product sales from biosimilar competition will be more like branded biologic competition than that seen when branded small molecules face generics but we believe that when multiple biosimilar versions of one of our products get approved and launched competition could intensify more rapidly resulting in a greater impact on our products sales Although we expect biosimilars to compete on price we believe many patients providers and payers will continue to place high value on the reputation reliability and safety of our products In the United States companies now have approved biosimilar versions of EPOGEN   NEUPOGEN   Neulasta  and ENBREL See also Government RegulationRegulation in the United StatesApproval of Biosimilars As biosimilar competitors come to market we will leverage both the experience we have had in the United States versus branded competition and our experience in competing against epoetin alfa and filgrastim biosimilars in Europe In addition although most of our products are biologics some of our products are smallmolecule products Because the FDA approval process allows generic manufacturers to rely on the safety and efficacy data of the innovator product rather than having to conduct their own costly and timeconsuming clinical trials generic manufacturers can often market their competing versions of our smallmolecule products at much lower prices As a result upon the expiration or loss of patent protection for a smallmolecule product we can lose the majority of revenues for that product in a very short period of time The introduction of new products the development of new processes or technologies by competitors or the emergence of new information about existing products may result in increased competition for our marketed products even for those protected by patents or in reductions in the prices we receive from selling our products In addition the development of new treatment options or standards of care may reduce the use of our products or may limit the utility and application of ongoing clinical trials for our product candidates As used in this document the term clinical trials may include prospective clinical trials observational studies registries and other studies See Item 1A Risk Factors Our products face substantial competition and Item 1A Risk Factors We currently face competition from biosimilars and expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars and generics in the future  7 The following table reflects our significant competitors and is not exhaustive Product Territory Competitormarketed product

Inc Pfizer 8 A subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited 9 KYPROLIS  is facing increased competition from several recently approved products 8 Reimbursement Sales of our principal products are dependent on the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement from thirdparty payers In many markets around the world these payers including government health systems private health insurers and other organizations remain focused on reducing the cost of healthcare and their efforts have intensified as a result of rising healthcare costs and economic challenges Drugs and in particular specialty drugs such as our products remain heavily scrutinized for cost containment As a result payers are becoming more restrictive regarding the use of biopharmaceutical products and scrutinizing the prices of these products while requiring a higher level of clinical evidence to support the benefit such products bring to patients and the broader healthcare system These pressures are intensified where our products are subject to increasing competition In the United States healthcare providers and other entities such as pharmacies and Pharmacy Benefit Managers PBMs are reimbursed for covered services and products they deliver through Medicare Medicaid and other government healthcare programs as well as through private payers We are required to provide rebates or discounts on our products that are reimbursed through certain government programs including Medicare and Medicaid and also provide discounts to qualifying healthcare providers under the Federal 340B Drug Pricing Program In addition we provide rebates to PBMs as well as other entities such as hospitals and pharmacies which are payments by a biopharmaceutical manufacturer of a portion of the products purchase price back to the PBMs or other entities Biopharmaceuticalproduct pricing remains central to discussions on controlling healthcare costs in the United States Policy makers from both of the major US political parties are pursuing policies to lower drug costs for patients In May 2018 US president Donald Trump and his administration released a drugpricing blueprint and requested public comment on an array of policy ideas intended to increase competition improve the federal governments negotiating power reduce drug prices and lower patients outofpocket costs The blueprint included a number of policy ideas with the potential to significantly affect whether individually or collectively the biopharmaceutical industry and the US presidential administration has already begun to implement certain elements described in the administrations drugpricing blueprint such as i seeking initial feedback on a potential program that would set the Medicare payment amount for Part B singlesource drugs and biologics to be more closely aligned with international drug prices and rely on thirdparty vendors ii issuing guidance to allow certain Medicare plans offered by private insurance companies to begin requiring that patients receiving Medicare Part B drugs first try a drug preferred by the plan before such plan will cover another therapy iii lowering initial reimbursement rates for new Part B drugs launched beginning in 2019 and iv proposing new rules to require drug price information in directtoconsumer drug television advertising The blueprint also discussed i the potential removal of the safeharbor protection under the federal antikickback statute for drug rebates paid to payers and ii changes to the Part D program At the same time value assessments of new technologies previously used predominantly outside the United States are having an impact in the US healthcare environment Healthcare provider organizations and independent organizations are creating their own value assessments of biopharmaceutical drugs for comparison with manufacturer pricing Although these organizations do not set drug prices they seek to influence pricing as well as payer and provider decision making by publicly disclosing their assessments often making assertions around what they believe to be the appropriate price to charge for a product In addition continued consolidation of payers and integration of providers and payers integrated delivery systems increase the level of market power held by our customers Such developments particularly when taken in combination with increasing product competition put greater pressure on access to pricing of and sales of our products In addition rebates andor discount levels as well as the number of entities that are entitled to receive them since they are reimbursed through government programs have increased over time For example the Bipartisan Budget Act enacted in 2018 requires biopharmaceutical manufacturers to pay greater discounts for patients in the Medicare Part D coverage gap beginning in 2019 and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ACA enacted in 2010 increased many of the mandatory discounts and rebates required of us The ACA also imposed a new Branded Prescription Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Importers fee payable each year by us and other manufacturers In the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act 2017 Tax Act signed by President Trump in December 2017 Congress removed a key ACA provision by repealing the individual mandate penalty which required every person to have health insurance or pay a penalty Future changes to government programs such as the ACA whether legislative or regulatory could impact the number of patient lives covered could raise or lower the cost or quality of insurance could affect Medicaid eligibility and could change levels of patient protections provided unless alternatives are put in place Other government legislative and regulatory actions that would have a significant impact on Amgen include changes to how the Medicare program covers and reimburses current and future drugs including for patients with endstage renal disease ESRD changes in the federal payment rate or new rebate requirements for covered drugs and policies for drug payment in Medicare or Medicaid and changes to coverage and payment for biosimilars such as policies that would facilitate easier substitution for or provide reimbursement advantages over the corresponding innovative products In ESRD the Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services CMS uses a bundledpayment system and recently finalized changes allowing more new dialysis drugs to be eligible for temporary addon payment adjustments starting in 2020 Sensipar  and Parsabiv  were already eligible for addon payment adjustments beginning in 2018 and will continue to receive them in 2019 CMS has indicated interest in testing new models for drug payment in Medicare Part B and Part D CMS also continues to test alternative payment models with providers such as the 9 Oncology Care Model These models provide financial incentives for providers who participate under the models providers take on greater risk for the overall cost and quality of care In addition in 2018 CMS implemented changes to Medicare payment to hospitals for Part B drugs acquired through the Federal 340B Drug Pricing Program but provided a financial incentive for hospitals to use biosimilar products over the corresponding innovative products As described above CMS is permitting Medicare Advantage plans to implement access controls for Part B drugs while also i considering a proposal that would set the Medicare payment amount for Part B singlesource drugs and biologics to more closely align with international drug prices and rely on thirdparty vendors and ii considering changes to Medicare Part D and Medicare Advantage These andor other changes have the potential to impact prescribing and patient access to Amgens therapies Additional efforts by state legislatures and government agencies in the United States could also affect us and our industry For example a California law requires manufacturers to provide payers advance notice of a price increase over a specified threshold and laws in Oregon and Vermont require manufacturers to submit price increase justifications to a state attorney agency if certain price increase and statespending thresholds are met Examples of other proposals that have been discussed and debated but not yet enacted include state ballot initiatives that would place a maximum price ceiling or cap on pharmaceutical products purchased by state agencies and state legislative efforts to cap pharmaceutical prices for commercial payers In the US private sector payers continue to institute cost reduction and containment measures that lower drug utilization andor spending altogether andor shift a greater portion of the costs to patients Such measures include more limited benefit plan designs higher patient copays or coinsurance obligations limitations on patients use of commercial manufacturer copay payment assistance programs including through copay accumulator adjustment or maximization programs stricter utilization management criteria before a patient may get access to a drug andor highertier formulary placement that increases the level of patient outofpocket costs The use of such measures by PBMs and insurers that handle the majority of sales for ENBREL and Repatha  has continued to intensify and thereby limited Amgen product usage and sales Consolidation has resulted in a smaller number of PBMs and insurers overseeing a large portion of total covered lives in the United States As a result PBMs and insurers have greater market power and negotiating leverage to mandate stricter utilization criteria andor exclude drugs from their formularies in favor of competitor drugs or alternative treatments Our past experience with Repatha  underscores that utilization management requirements including the burdensome administrative processes required of physicians to demonstrate and document that patients meet such requirements continue to be a significant challenge for patients and physicians limiting access for appropriate usage Formulary exclusion effectively encourages patients and providers to seek alternative treatments or pay 100 of the cost of a drug A drugs inclusion and favorable positioning on formulary is essential to ensure patients have access Even when access is available some patients abandon their prescriptions due to economic reasons In highly competitive treatment markets such as with ENBREL Repatha  and Aimovig   PBMs are also able to exert negotiating leverage by requiring incremental rebates from manufacturers in order to maintain their formulary position In many countries outside the United States governmentsponsored healthcare systems are the primary payers for drugs and biologics With increasing budgetary constraints andor difficulty in understanding the value of medicines governments and payers in many countries are applying a variety of measures to exert downward price pressure These measures can include mandatory price controls price referencing therapeuticreference pricing increases in mandates incentives for generic substitution and biosimilar usage and governmentmandated price cuts In this regard many countries have health technology assessment organizations that use formal economic metrics such as costeffectiveness to determine prices coverage and reimbursement of new therapies and these organizations are expanding in established and emerging markets We expect that countries will continue to take aggressive actions to seek to reduce expenditures on drugs and biologics Similarly fiscal constraints may also affect the extent to which countries are willing to approve new and innovative therapies andor allow access to new technologies The dynamics and developments discussed above serve to create pressure on the pricing and potential usage of our products and the industry We remain focused on delivering breakthrough treatments for unmet medical needs Amgen is committed to working with the entire healthcare community to ensure continued innovation and to facilitate patient access to needed medicines We do this by  investing billions of dollars annually in RD  developing more affordable therapeutic choices in the form of highquality and reliablysupplied biosimilars  pricing our medicines to reflect the value they provide  partnering with payers to share risk and accountability for health outcomes  providing patient support and education programs and helping patients in financial need access our medicines and  working with policy makers patients and other stakeholders to establish a sustainable healthcare system with access to affordable care and where patients and their healthcare professionals are the primary decision makers 10 See Item 1A Risk Factors Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from thirdparty payers and pricing and reimbursement pressures may affect our profitability and Item 1A Risk Factors Guidelines and recommendations published by various organizations can reduce the use of our products Manufacturing Distribution and Raw Materials Manufacturing We believe we are a leader in the manufacturing of biologics and that our manufacturing capabilities represent a competitive advantage The products we manufacture consist of both biologics and smallmolecule drugs The majority of our products are biologics that are produced in living cells and that are inherently complex due to naturallyoccurring molecular variations Highly specialized knowledge and extensive process and product characterization are required to transform laboratoryscale processes into reproducible commercial manufacturing processes Further our expertise in manufacturing of biologics positions us well for leadership in the global biosimilars market For additional information regarding manufacturing facilities see Item 2 Properties Our internal manufacturing network has the commercial production capabilities of bulk manufacturing formulation fill finish and device assembly These activities are performed within the United States and its territories in our Puerto Rico Rhode Island and California facilities as well as internationally in our Ireland Netherlands and Singapore facilities In addition we utilize thirdparty contract manufacturers to supplement the capacity or capability of our commercial manufacturing network To support our clinical trials we manufacture product candidates primarily at our California and to a lesser extent our Rhode Island facilities We also utilize thirdparty contract manufacturers for certain clinical products See Item 1A Risk Factors for a discussion of the factors that could adversely impact our manufacturing operations and the global supply of our products Distribution We operate distribution centers in Puerto Rico Kentucky California and the Netherlands for worldwide distribution of the majority of our commercial and clinical products We also use thirdparty distributors to supplement distribution of our products worldwide Other In addition to the manufacturing and distribution activities noted above each of our manufacturing locations also includes key manufacturing support functions including quality control process development procurement production scheduling and warehousing Certain of those manufacturing and distribution activities are highly regulated by the FDA as well as other international regulatory agencies See Government RegulationRegulation in the United StatesRegulation of Manufacturing Standards Manufacturing Initiatives We have multiple ongoing initiatives that are designed to extend our manufacturing advantage by optimizing our manufacturing network andor mitigating risks while continuing to ensure adequate supply of our products In 2017 our nextgeneration biomanufacturing plant in Singapore was licensed by the FDA and the EMA for certain commercialscale production In 2018 we successfully completed additional bulk process qualification campaigns which if approved would permit the commercial production of an additional product at that site A nextgeneration biomanufacturing plant incorporates multiple innovative technologies into a single facility and therefore can be built in half the construction time with approximately onehalf of the operating cost of a traditional plant Nextgeneration biomanufacturing plants require a smaller manufacturing footprint and offer greater environmental benefits including reduced consumption of water and energy and lower levels of carbon emissions Within the plant the equipment is portable and smaller and some components are disposable which provides greater flexibility and speed when manufacturing different medicines simultaneously This eliminates costly and complex retrofitting inherent in standard plants and allows Amgen to respond to changing demands for its medicines with increased agility ultimately impacting the speed at which a medicine is available for patients The Singapore site also has a plant with the capability to produce smallmolecule drugs When approved by relevant regulatory authorities this plant can be used for commercial manufacturing In July 2018 we announced the groundbreaking of our new nextgeneration biomanufacturing plant that will be constructed at our West Greenwich Rhode Island campus The new plant is expected to be the first of its kind in the United States and will use our nextgeneration biomanufacturing capabilities After construction has been completed and upon approval by the FDA and other global regulatory authorities this plant will expand our capacity to manufacture certain products for US and global markets See Item 1A Risk Factors Manufacturing difficulties disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales 11 Raw Materials and Medical Devices Certain raw materials medical devices including companion diagnostics and components necessary for the commercial andor clinical manufacturing of our products are provided by and are the proprietary products of unaffiliated thirdparty suppliers certain of which may be our only sources for such materials We currently attempt to manage the risk associated with such suppliers by inventory management relationship management and evaluation of alternative sources when feasible We also monitor the financial condition of certain suppliers and their ability to supply our needs See Item 1A Risk Factors We rely on thirdparty suppliers for certain of our raw materials medical devices and components We perform various procedures to help authenticate the source of raw materials including intermediary materials used in the manufacture of our products which include verification of the country of origin The procedures are incorporated into the manufacturing processes we and our thirdparty contract manufacturers perform Government Regulation Regulation by government authorities in the United States and other countries is a significant factor in the production and marketing of our products and our ongoing RD activities In order to clinically test manufacture and market products for therapeutic use we must satisfy mandatory procedures and safety and effectiveness standards established by various regulatory bodies Compliance with these standards is complex and failure to comply with any of these standards can result in significant implications See Item 1A Risk Factors for a discussion of factors including global regulatory implications that can adversely impact our development and marketing of commercial products Regulation in the United States In the United States the Public Health Service Act the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act FDCA and the regulations promulgated thereunder as well as other federal and state statutes and regulations govern among other things the production research development testing manufacture quality control labeling storage record keeping approval advertising promotion and distribution of our products as well as the reporting of certain payments and other transfers of value to healthcare professionals and teaching hospitals Clinical Development and Product Approval Drug development in our industry is complex challenging and risky and failure rates are high Product development cycles are typically very longapproximately 10 to 15 years from discovery to market A potential new medicine must undergo many years of preclinical and clinical testing to establish its safety and efficacy for use in humans at appropriate dosing levels and with an acceptable riskbenefit profile After laboratory analysis and preclinical testing in animals we file an Investigational New Drug Application IND with the FDA to begin human testing Typically we undertake an FDAdesignated threephase human clinical testing program  In phase 1 we conduct small clinical trials to investigate the safety and proper dose ranges of our product candidates in a small number of human subjects  In phase 2 we conduct clinical trials to investigate sideeffect profiles and the efficacy of our product candidates in a large number of patients who have the disease or condition under study  In phase 3 we conduct clinical trials to investigate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in a large number of patients who have the disease or condition under study The FDA monitors the progress of each trial conducted under an IND and may at its discretion reevaluate alter suspend or terminate the testing based on the data accumulated to that point and the FDAs riskbenefit assessment with regard to the patients enrolled in the trial The results of preclinical and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA in the form of either a BLA for biologic products or a New Drug Application for smallmolecule products We are not permitted to market or promote a new product until the FDA has approved our marketing application Approval of Biosimilars  The ACA authorized the FDA to approve biosimilars via a separate abbreviated pathway The pathway allows sponsors of a biosimilar to seek and obtain regulatory approval based in part on the nonclinical and clinical trial data of an originator product to which the biosimilar has been demonstrated to be highly similar and to have no clinically meaningful differences in terms of safety purity and potency The relevance of demonstrating similarity is that in many cases biosimilars can be brought to market without conducting the full suite of clinical trials typically required of originators as riskbenefit has previously been established In order to preserve incentives for future innovation the law establishes a period of exclusivity for originators products which in general prohibits biosimilars from gaining FDA approval based in part on reliance on or reference to the originators data in their application to the FDA for 12 years after initial FDA approval of the originator product The law does not change the duration of patents granted on biologic products The FDA has released a number of guidance documents as part of the implementation of the abbreviated approval pathway for biosimilars some of which remain in draft form 12 As of the end of 2018 16 biosimilar applications have been approved by the FDA including our products AMJEVITA TM  a biosimilar candidate to HUMIRA  adalimumab and MVASI TM  a biosimilar candidate to Avastin  bevacizumab as well as competitors to our products ENBREL Aranesp   EPOGEN   NEUPOGEN  and Neulasta   A number of manufacturers have announced the filing of marketing applications to the FDA under the biosimilar pathway some of which are for biosimilars of our products Regulation of Product Marketing and Promotion  The FDA regulates the marketing and promotion of drug products Our product promotion for approved product indications must comply with the statutory standards of the FDCA and the FDAs implementing regulations and guidance The FDAs review of marketing and promotional activities encompasses but is not limited to directtoconsumer advertising healthcareproviderdirected advertising and promotion sales representative communications to healthcare professionals promotional programming and promotional activities involving electronic media The FDA may also review industrysponsored scientific and educational activities that make representations regarding product safety or efficacy in a promotional context The FDA may take enforcement action against a company for promoting unapproved uses of a product or for other violations of its advertising and labeling laws and regulations Enforcement action may include product seizures injunctions civil or criminal penalties or regulatory letters which may require corrective advertising or other corrective communications to healthcare professionals Failure to comply with the FDAs regulations also can result in adverse publicity or increased scrutiny of company activities by the US Congress or other legislators Additionally as described below such failure may lead to additional liability under US health care fraud and abuse laws Regulation of Manufacturing Standards  The FDA regulates and inspects equipment facilities laboratories and processes used in the manufacturing and testing of products prior to providing approval to market products If after receiving approval from the FDA we make a material change in manufacturing equipment location or process additional regulatory review may be required We also must adhere to current Good Manufacturing Practice regulations and productspecific regulations enforced by the FDA through its facilities inspection program The FDA conducts regular periodic visits to reinspect our equipment facilities laboratories and processes following an initial approval Regulation of Combination Products  Combination products are defined by the FDA to include products composed of two or more regulated components eg a biologic andor drug and a device Biologicsdrugs and devices each have their own regulatory requirements and combination products may have additional requirements A number of our marketed products meet this definition and are regulated under this framework and we expect that a number of our pipeline product candidates will be evaluated for regulatory approval under this framework as well Regulation outside the United States In the European Union EU countries as well as Switzerland Canada Australia and Japan regulatory requirements and approval processes are similar in principle to those in the United States In the EU there are currently two potential tracks for seeking marketing approval for a product not authorized in any EU member state a decentralized procedure and a centralized procedure In the decentralized procedure  identical applications for marketing authorization are submitted simultaneously to the national regulatory agencies Regulatory review is led by one member state the referencemember state and its assessmentbased on safety quality and efficacyis reviewed and approved assuming there are no concerns that the product poses a serious risk to public health by the other member states from which the applicant is seeking approval the concernedmember states The decentralized procedure leads to a series of single national approvals in all relevant countries In the centralized procedure  which is required of all products derived from biotechnology a company submits a single MAA to the EMA which conducts an evaluation of the dossier drawing upon its scientific resources across Europe If the drug product is proven to fulfill the requirements for quality safety and efficacy the EMAs CHMP adopts a positive opinion which is transmitted to the EC for final decision on grant of the marketing authorization While the EC generally follows the CHMPs opinion it is not bound to do so Subsequent commercialization is enabled by countrybycountry reimbursement approval In the EU biosimilars are approved under a specialized pathway of the centralized procedure As with the US pathway applicants seek and obtain regulatory approval for a biosimilar once the data exclusivity period for the original reference product has expired relying in part on the data submitted for the originator product together with data evidencing that the biosimilar is highly similar in terms of quality safety and efficacy to the original reference product authorized in the European Economic Area As a result of the United Kingdoms vote to leave the EU in March 2019 the EMA announced that it will relocate its headquarters from London to Amsterdam by March 30 2019 While negotiations continue regarding the terms of the United Kingdoms withdrawal from the EU the specific impact to the supervision regulation and supply of medicines in the United Kingdom and Europe remain unclear 13 Other countries such as Russia Turkey and those in Latin America and the Middle East have review processes and data requirements similar to those of the EU and in some cases can rely on prior marketing approval from US or EU regulatory authorities The regulatory process in these countries may include manufacturingtesting facility inspections testing of drug product upon importation and other domestic requirements In Asia Pacific a number of countries such as China Japan South Korea and Taiwan may require local clinical trial data for bridging purposes as part of the drug registration process in addition to global clinical trials which can add to overall drug development and registration timelines In most of the Asian markets registration timelines depend on marketing approval in the United States or the EU In some markets in Asia such as China Thailand and Indonesia the regulatory timelines can be less predictable The regulatory process may also include manufacturingtesting facility inspections testing of drug product upon importation and other domestic requirements Countries such as Australia and Japan have more mature systems that would allow for submissions in more competitive time frames Regarding biosimilars several of these countries have pathways to register biosimilars eg South Korea India Australia Singapore and Taiwan and biosimilar products are already present on the markets eg Australia and South Korea In some countries such as Japan and those in the EU medical devices may be subject to regulatory regimes whereby the manufacturer must establish that its medical device conforms to essential requirements set out in the law for the particular device category For example in the EU with limited exceptions medical devices placed on the market must bear the Conformit Europenne marking to indicate their conformity with legal requirements Postapproval Phase After approval we continue to monitor adverse events and product complaints reported following the use of our products through routine postmarketing surveillance and studies when applicable We report such events to the appropriate regulatory agencies as required per local regulations for individual cases and aggregate reports We proactively monitor according to good pharmacovigilance practices and ensure implementation of signal detection assessment and the communication of adverse events that may be associated with the use of our products We also proactively monitor product complaints through our quality systems which includes assessing our drug delivery devices for device complaints adverse events and malfunctions We may also be required by regulatory agencies to conduct further clinical trials on our marketed products as a condition of their approval or to provide additional information on safety and efficacy Health authorities including the FDA have authority to mandate labeling changes to products at any point in a products lifecycle based on new safety information or as part of an evolving label change to a particular class of products Health authorities including the FDA also have the authority before or after approval to require companies to implement a risk management program for a product to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks Each risk management program is unique and varies depending on the specific factors required In the United States a risk management program is known as a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy REMS and we currently have REMS for Prolia   Nplate  and BLINCYTO   Other Regulation We are also subject to various laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse including antikickback laws and falseclaims laws Antikickback laws make it illegal to solicit offer receive or pay any remuneration in exchange for or to induce the referral of business including the purchase or prescribing of a particular drug that is reimbursed by a state or federal program Falseclaims laws prohibit knowingly and willingly presenting or causing to be presented for payment to thirdparty payers including Medicare and Medicaid any claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent claims for items or services not provided as claimed or claims for medically unnecessary items or services Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal andor civil sanctions including fines and civil monetary penalties as well as by the possibility of exclusion from federal healthcare programs including Medicare and Medicaid Liability under the falseclaims laws may also arise when a violation of certain laws or regulations related to the underlying products eg violations regarding improper promotional activity or unlawful payments contributes to the submission of a false claim In 2012 Amgen entered into a corporate integrity agreement with the Office of Inspector General OIG of the US Department of Health and Human Services which was formally closed out in August 2018 Due to the breadth of the statutory provisions and the absence of guidance in the form of regulations or court decisions addressing some of our practices it is possible that in the future our practices might be further challenged under antikickback or similar laws Additionally the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act FCPA prohibits US corporations and their representatives from offering promising authorizing or making payments to any foreign government official government staff member political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad The scope of the FCPA arguably includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries Other countries have enacted similar anticorruption laws andor regulations Our business has been and will continue to be subject to various other US and foreign laws rules andor regulations 14 Research and Development and Selected Product Candidates We focus our RD on novel human therapeutics for the treatment of serious illness We capitalize on our strength in human genetics novel biology and protein engineering We leverage our biologic expertise and take a modalityindependent approach to RD We use cuttingedge science and technology to study subtle biological mechanisms in search of therapies that will improve the lives of those who suffer from diseases Our discovery research programs may therefore yield targets that lead to the development of human therapeutics delivered as large molecules small molecules other combination modalities or new modalities Leveraging two decades of research at deCODE a global leader in analyzing the human genome we are reshaping our portfolio and increasingly focusing efforts on validated targets Human genetic validation is used whenever possible in order to enhance the likelihood of success For the years ended December 31 2018  2017 and 2016  our RD expenses were 37 billion  36 billion and 38 billion respectively We have major RD centers in Thousand Oaks and San Francisco California Cambridge Massachusetts Iceland and the United Kingdom as well as smaller research centers and development facilities globally See Item 2 Properties Our clinical trial activities are conducted by both our internal staff and thirdparty contract clinical trial service providers To increase the number of patients available for enrollment in our clinical trials we have opened clinical sites and will continue opening clinical sites and enrolling patients in a number of geographic locations See Government RegulationRegulation in the United StatesClinical Development and Product Approval for a discussion of government regulation over clinical development Also see Item 1A Risk Factors We must conduct clinical trials in humans before we commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications Some of our competitors are actively engaged in RD in areas in which we have products or in which we are developing product candidates or new indications for existing products For example we compete with other clinical trials for eligible patients which may limit the number of available patients who meet the criteria for certain clinical trials The competitive marketplace for our product candidates is greatly dependent on the timing of entry into the market Early entry may have important advantages in gaining product acceptance thereby contributing to a products eventual success and profitability Accordingly we expect that in some cases the relative speed with which we can develop products complete clinical testing receive regulatory approval and supply commercial quantities of a product to the market will be important to our competitive position In addition to product candidates and marketed products generated from our internal RD efforts we acquire companies acquire and license certain product and RD technology rights and establish RD arrangements with third parties to enhance our strategic position within our industry by strengthening and diversifying our RD capabilities product pipeline and marketed product base In pursuing these RD arrangements and licensing or acquisition activities we face competition from other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that also seek to license or acquire technologies product candidates or marketed products from those entities performing the RD The following table shows a selection of certain of our product candidates by phase of development in our therapeutic areas of focus as of February 12 2019 unless otherwise indicated Additional product candidate information can be found on our website at wwwamgencom The website address is not intended to function as a hyperlink and the information contained on our website is not intended to be a part of this filing The information in this section does not include other nonregistrational clinical trials that we may conduct for purposes other than for submission to regulatory agencies for their approval of a new product indication 15 We may conduct nonregistrational clinical trials for various reasons including to evaluate

Relationships From time to time we enter into business relationships including joint ventures and collaborative arrangements for the RD manufacture andor commercialization of products andor product candidates In addition we acquire product and RD technology rights and establish RD collaborations with third parties to enhance our strategic position within our industry by strengthening and diversifying our RD capabilities product pipeline and marketed product base These arrangements generally provide for nonrefundable upfront license fees development and commercialperformance milestone payments cost sharing royalty payments andor profit sharing The activities under these collaboration agreements are performed with no guarantee of either technological or commercial success and each is unique in nature Trade secret protection for our unpatented confidential and proprietary information is important to us To protect our trade secrets we generally require counterparties to execute confidentiality agreements upon commencement of a business relationship with us However others could either develop independently the same or similar information or unlawfully obtain access to our information KirinAmgen Inc During the first quarter of 2018 we acquired the remaining 50 ownership interest of KirinAmgen Inc KA from Kirin Holdings Company Limited Kirin making KA a wholly owned subsidiary of Amgen Prior to the closing of the share acquisition KA was a 5050 joint venture with Kirin KA develops and then licenses all product rights that have been transferred from Amgen and Kirin See Part IVNote 3 Business combinations and Note 10 Related party transactions to the Consolidated Financial Statements Prior to the closing of the share acquisition KA had given us exclusive

2017 we expanded our existing migraine collaboration with Novartis In the United States Amgen and Novartis jointly develop and collaborate on the commercialization of Aimovig   Amgen as the principal recognizes product sales of Aimovig  in the United States shares US commercialization costs with Novartis and pays Novartis a significant royalty on net sales in the United States Novartis holds global codevelopment rights and exclusive commercial rights outside the United States and Japan for Aimovig  and other specified migraine programs Novartis pays Amgen doubledigit royalties on net sales of the products in the Novartis exclusive territories and funds a portion of global RD expenses In addition Novartis will make a payment to Amgen of up to 100 million if certain commercial and expenditure thresholds are achieved with respect to Aimovig  in the United States Amgen manufactures and supplies Aimovig  worldwide UCB We are in a collaboration with UCB for the development and commercialization of EVENITY TM  Under our collaboration UCB has the rights to lead commercialization for EVENITY TM for all indications in Europe China excluding Hong Kong and Brazil All other territories have been allocated to Amgen Generally development costs and future worldwide commercialization profits and losses related to the collaboration after accounting for expenses are shared equally Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals Inc We are in a collaboration with Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals Inc Bayer to jointly develop and commercialize Nexavar  sorafenib In 2015 we amended the terms of our collaboration agreement with Bayer which terminated the copromotion agreement in the United States and transferred all US operational responsibilities to Bayer including commercial and medical affairs activities Prior to the termination of the copromotion agreement we copromoted Nexavar  with Bayer and shared equally in the profits in the United States In lieu of this profit share Bayer now pays us a royalty on US sales of Nexavar  at a percentage rate in the high 30s Outside the United States and Japan Bayer manages all commercialization activities and incurs all sales and marketing expenditures and mutually agreed RD expenses and we reimburse Bayer for half of those expenditures In all countries outside the United States and Japan we receive 50 of net profits on sales of Nexavar  after deducting certain Bayerrelated costs The rights to develop and market Nexavar  in Japan are reserved to Bayer DaVita Inc In January 2017 we entered into a sixyear supply agreement with DaVita Inc DaVita which superseded the previously existing sevenyear supply agreement that commenced in 2012 Pursuant to the 2017 agreement we supply EPOGEN  and Aranesp  in amounts necessary to meet specified annual percentages of DaVitas and its affiliates requirements for erythropoiesisstimulating agents ESAs used in providing dialysis services in the United States and Puerto Rico Such percentage varies during the term of the agreement but in each year is at least 90 The agreement expires in 2022 The agreement may be terminated by either party before expiration of its term in the

information contained in our website and in the SECs website is not intended to be a part of this filing Item 1A RISK FACTORS This report and other documents we file with the SEC contain forwardlooking statements that are based on current expectations estimates forecasts and projections about us our future performance our business our beliefs and our managements assumptions These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties our business faces The risks described below are not the only ones we face Our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies such as employment relations general economic conditions geopolitical events and international operations Further additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may in the future materially and adversely affect our business operations liquidity and stock price Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from thirdparty payers and pricing and reimbursement pressures may affect our profitability Sales of our products depend on the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement from thirdparty payers including government healthcare programs and private insurance plans Governments and private payers continue to pursue initiatives to contain costs and manage drug utilization These payers are increasingly focused on the effectiveness benefits and costs of similar treatments which could result for our products in lower reimbursement rates or narrower populations for whom payers will reimburse Continued intense public scrutiny of the price of drugs and other healthcare costs together with payer dynamics may limit our ability to set or adjust the price of our products based on their value which could have a material adverse effect on our business In the United States the public discussions of drug pricing issues are likely to continue Changing federal coverage and reimbursement policies and practices have impacted and may continue to impact access to and sales of our products A substantial portion of our US business relies on reimbursement from US federal government healthcare programs and commercial insurance plans regulated by the US federal and state governments See Item 1 BusinessReimbursement Our business has and will continue to be impacted by legislative actions changing US federal reimbursement policy For example in February 2018 the US Congress passed legislation requiring biopharmaceutical manufacturers to provide greater discounts beginning in 2019 on products dispensed to patients in the coverage gap between the initial coverage limit of Medicare Part D and the programs catastrophiccoverage threshold which will reduce our net product sales relating to such patients Additional legislative proposals have been introduced by members of Congress to overhaul provisions of the Patient Protection and ACA to allow commerciallevel reimportation of prescription medications from Canada or other countries and to enable Medicare to negotiate drug prices with biopharmaceutical manufacturers Congressional focus on drug pricing has increased since the Democrats took control of the US House of Representatives in November 2018 For example in January 2019 the chair of the House Oversight and Reform Committee sent letters to twelve different biopharmaceutical manufacturers including Amgen seeking documents and detailed information about such companies drug pricing Both that committee and the Senate Finance Committee held committee hearings in January 2019 on the topic of drug pricing and have indicated that further committee hearings on the topic are likely Also our business has been and is expected to continue to be impacted by changes in US federal reimbursement policy resulting from executive actions federal regulations or federal demonstration projects For example in May 2018 the US presidential administration released a drug pricing blueprint and requested public comment on an array of policy ideas intended to increase competition improve the negotiating power of the federal government reduce drug prices and lower patient outofpocket costs This blueprint includes a number of policy ideas with the potential to significantly impact whether individually or collectively our industry Such proposals include moving coverage and reimbursement for Medicare Part B drugs into Medicare 22 Part D instituting a competitive acquisition program for Part B drugs in which competing thirdparty vendors take on the financial risk of acquiring drugs and billing Medicare removing the safe harbor protection under the federal antikickback statute for drug rebates paid to payers and requiring the inclusion of drug price information in directtoconsumer drug advertising Since that time the president andor federal agencies such as CMS have announced a number of demonstration projects recommendations and proposals to implement various elements described in the drug pricing blueprint CMS the federal agency responsible for administering Medicare and overseeing state Medicaid programs and Health Insurance Marketplaces has substantial power to implement policy changes or demonstration projects that can quickly and significantly affect how drugs including our products are covered and reimbursed For example in October 2018 President Trump announced that CMS was evaluating a pilot program proposed to initially cover fifty percent of spending on Part B singlesource drugs referred to as the International Price Index that would among other things set the Medicare payment amount for such singlesource drugs to more closely align with international drug prices CMS has taken additional actions to implement other elements described in the administrations drugpricing blueprint including issuing guidance to allow certain Medicare plans offered by private insurance companies to require that patients receiving Medicare Part B drugs first try a drug preferred by the plan before such plan will cover another therapy and proposing lower reimbursement rates for new Part B drugs And on January 31 2019 the US Department of Health and Human Services released a proposal to revise the federal antikickback statute safe harbor regulations to exclude from safe harbor protection certain rebates and other forms of remuneration paid by a manufacturer of prescription drugs to Medicaid managed care organizations or plan sponsors under Medicare Part D either directly or through PBMs Further CMS has undertaken demonstration projects to test care models such as the CMS Oncology Care Model which provides participating physician practices with performancebased financial incentives that aim to manage or reduce Medicare costs without negatively impacting the efficacy of care We believe the Oncology Care Model has reduced utilization of certain of our oncology products by participating physician practices and may continue to do so in the future In addition CMS has solicited suggestions regarding other potential care models In this dynamic environment we are unable to predict which or how many of these various federal policy legislative or regulatory changes may ultimately be enacted to the extent that these or other federal government initiatives decrease or modify the coverage or reimbursement available for our products limit our ability to offer copay payment assistance to commercial patients require that we pay increased rebates or shift other costs to us limit or impact our decisions regarding the pricing of biopharmaceutical products or otherwise reduce the use of our US products such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations We also face risks relating to the reporting of pricing data that affects the reimbursement of and discounts provided for our products Government price reporting regulations are complex and may require a manufacturer to update certain previously submitted data If our submitted pricing data are incorrect we may become subject to substantial fines and penalties or other government enforcement actions which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations In addition as a result of restating previously reported price data we also may be required to pay additional rebates and provide additional discounts Changing state reimbursement and pricing actions may impact access to and have impacted and may continue to impact sales of our products At the state level government actions or ballot initiatives can also affect how our products are covered and reimbursed andor create additional pressure on our pricing decisions A number of states have adopted and many other states have discussed and debated and are considering new pricing actions including proposals designed to require biopharmaceutical manufacturers to publicly report proprietary pricing information limit price increases or to place a maximum price ceiling or cap on biopharmaceutical products Existing and proposed state pricing laws have added complexity to the pricing of drugs and may already be impacting industry pricing decisions For example in October 2017 California enacted a drugpricing transparency bill that requires biopharmaceutical manufacturers to notify health insurers and government health plans at least 60 days before scheduled prescription drug price increases that exceed certain thresholds Other states are seeking to change the way their states pay for drugs for patients covered by state programs For example in August 2018 the Ohio Department of Medicaid ordered that all the states Medicaid managed care plans terminate and renegotiate contracts with PBMs to eliminate the drug purchasing model in which PBMs bill the state more than they reimburse pharmacists for filling Medicaid patient prescriptions In January 2019 Californias governor issued an executive order expanding state Medicaid coverage and directing state agencies and programs to consolidate drug purchases and to negotiate drug prices with manufacturers Other states could adopt similar approaches or could pursue different policy changes in a continuing effort to reduce their costs Ultimately as with US federal government actions existing or future state government actions or ballot initiatives may also have a material adverse effect on our product sales business and results of operations 23 US commercial payer actions have impacted and may continue to impact access to and sales of our products Payers including healthcare insurers PBMs and group purchasing organizations increasingly seek ways to reduce their and their respective members costs With increasing frequency payers are adopting benefit plan changes that shift a greater portion of drug costs to patients Such measures include more limited benefit plan designs high deductible plans higher patient copay or coinsurance obligations and limitations on patients use of manufacturer commercial copay payment assistance programs including through copay accumulator adjustment or maximization programs Payers have sought and will likely continue to seek price discounts or rebates in connection with the placement of our products on their formularies or those they manage particularly in treatment areas where the payer has taken the position that multiple branded products are therapeutically comparable Payers also control costs by imposing restrictions on access to or usage of our products such as requiring that patients first try a drug preferred by the payer or receive the payers prior authorization before covering the product or that patients use a mailorder pharmacy or mailorder pharmacy or a limited network of fullyowned specialty pharmacies payers may also choose to exclude certain indications for which our products are approved or even choose to exclude coverage entirely For example the burdensome administrative processes required for physicians to demonstrate or document that the patients for whom Repatha  has been prescribed meet payer utilization management criteria has limited and may continue to limit patient access to Repatha  treatment In an effort to reduce barriers to access we reduced the net price of Repatha  by providing greater discounts and rebates to payers including PBMs that administer Medicare Part D prescription drug plans However affordability of patient outofpocket copay cost has and may continue to limit patient use For example a very high percentage of Medicare patients have abandoned their Repatha  prescriptions rather than pay their copay payment In late 2018 and early 2019 we introduced a set of new NDCs to make Repatha  available at a lower list price to attempt to address affordability for patients particularly those on Medicare Despite the recent net and list price reductions payers may continue to restrict patient access change formulary coverage for Repatha   seek further discounts or rebates or take other actions that could reduce our sales of Repatha   Further our introduction of the new NDCs may not be rapidly adopted by payers which could continue to limit patient use and could also reduce our sales of Repatha   Significant consolidation in the health insurance industry has resulted in a few large insurers and PBMs exerting greater pressure in pricing and usage negotiations with drug manufacturers significantly increasing discounts and rebates required of manufacturers and limiting patient access and usage For example in the United States the top three PBMs now oversee greater than twothirds of prescription claims as well as government and commercial covered lives The consolidation among insurers PBMs and other payers including through integrated delivery systems andor with specialty or mailorder pharmacies and pharmacy retailers has increased the negotiating leverage such entities have over us and other drug manufacturers and has resulted in greater price discounts rebates and fees for other services being realized by those payers For example during the fourth quarter of 2018 two of the nations largest PBMs Express Scripts and CVS Health completed their combinations with major insurance companies Cigna and Aetna respectively Additional consolidation would further increase the leverage of such entities Ultimately additional discounts rebates coverage or plan changes restrictions or exclusions imposed by these commercial payers could have a material adverse effect on our product sales business and results of operations Government and commercial payer actions outside the United States have impacted and will continue to impact access to and sales of our products Outside the United States we expect countries will continue to take actions to reduce their drug expenditures See Item 1 BusinessReimbursement International reference pricing IRP has been widely used by many countries outside the United States to control costs based on an external benchmark of a products price in other countries IRP policies can quickly and frequently change and may not reflect differences in the burden of disease indications market structures or affordability differences across countries or regions In addition countries may refuse to reimburse or may restrict the reimbursed population for a product when their national health technology assessments do not consider a medicine to demonstrate sufficient clinical benefit beyond existing therapies or that it does not meet certain cost effectiveness thresholds For example despite the EMAs May 2018 approval of Repatha  for the treatment of patients with established atherosclerotic disease reimbursement for Repatha  in France and Germany has remained limited to narrower patient populations such as those with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia following national health technology assessments in mid2018 While the pricing and reimbursement process in those countries remains ongoing these assessments currently limit our efforts in France and Germany to expand Repatha  access to the broader patient population covered by the approved label Failure to obtain coverage and reimbursement for our products a deterioration in their existing coverage and reimbursement or a decline in the timeliness or certainty of payment by payers to physicians and other providers could negatively impact the ability or willingness of healthcare providers to prescribe our products for their patients or could otherwise negatively affect the use of our products or the prices we receive for them Such changes could have a material adverse effect on our product sales business and results of operations We currently face competition from biosimilars and expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars and generics in the future We currently face competition from biosimilars in both Europe and the United States and we expect to face increasing biosimilar andor generics competition this year and beyond Expiration or successful challenge of applicable patent rights or 24 expiration of an applicable exclusivity period would accelerate such competition and we expect to face more litigation regarding the validity andor scope of our patents Our products may also experience greater competition from lowercost biosimilars or generics that come to market when branded products that compete with our products lose their own patent protection To the extent that governments adopt more permissive approval frameworks and competitors are able to obtain broader or expedited marketing approval for biosimilars and generics the rate of increased competition for our products could accelerate In the EU biosimilars are evaluated for marketing authorization pursuant to a set of general and product classspecific guidelines In addition in an effort to spur biosimilar utilization andor increase potential healthcare savings some EU countries have adopted and others are attempting to adopt biosimilar uptake measures such as requiring physician prescribing quotas or promoting switching or pharmacy substitution of biosimilars for the corresponding reference products and other countries may adopt similar measures Some EU countries impose automatic price reductions upon market entry of one or more biosimilar competitors While the degree of competitive impact of biosimilar competition differs between EU countries and between products in the EU the overall use of biosimilars and the rate at which product sales of innovative products are being impacted by biosimilar competition is increasing In the United States the ACA authorized the FDA to approve biosimilars via a separate abbreviated pathway See Item 1 BusinessGovernment RegulationRegulation in the United StatesApproval of Biosimilars The first biosimilar entrant into the US market Sandozs Zarxio   is a biosimilar version of NEUPOGEN  and was launched in the United States in 2015 Since then the FDA has approved additional biosimilars including biosimilar versions of ENBREL Neulasta  and EPOGEN   and a growing number of companies have announced that they are also developing biosimilar versions of our products Two biosimilar versions of Neulasta  are now marketed in the United States and others may receive approval in 2019 Impact to our Neulasta  sales could accelerate as additional competitors are launched See Item 1 BusinessMarketing Distribution and Selected Marketed ProductsCompetition The approved biosimilar version of EPOGEN  has also launched in the United States and we are currently involved in patent litigation with the manufacturer of the approved version of ENBREL Manufacturers of biosimilars may attempt to compete with our products by offering lower list prices greater discounts or rebates or contracts that offer longerterm pricing or a broader portfolio of other products Companies pursuing development of biosimilar versions of our products have challenged and may continue to challenge our patents well in advance of the expiration of our material patents For information related to our biosimilars and generics patent litigation see Part IVNote 20 Contingencies and commitments to the Consolidated Financial Statements See Our intellectual property positions may be challenged invalidated or circumvented or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation The US pathway includes the option for biosimilar products that meet certain criteria to be approved as interchangeable with their reference products Some companies currently developing or already marketing biosimilars may seek to register their products as interchangeable biosimilars which could make it easier for pharmacists to substitute those biosimilars for our reference products or could encourage prescribers or payers who are inclined to select the interchangeable biosimilar over our innovative products or our biosimilars In addition critics of the 12year exclusivity period in the biosimilar pathway law will likely continue to seek to shorten the data exclusivity period andor to encourage the FDA to interpret narrowly the laws provisions regarding which new products receive data exclusivity For example the FDA is considering whether subsequent changes to a licensed biologic would be protected by the remainder of the reference products original 12year exclusivity period a concept known in the generic drug context as umbrella exclusivity If the FDA were to decide that umbrella exclusivity does not apply to biological reference products or were to make other changes to the exclusivity period this could expose us to biosimilar competition at an earlier time There also have been and may continue to be public legislative and FDA efforts to promote price competition through policies enabling easier generic and biosimilar entry including efforts to lower standards for demonstrating biosimilarity or interchangeability and provide greater clarity for how to do so and through changes to the reimbursement policies for biologics Upon the expiration or loss of patent protection for one of our smallmolecule products we can lose the majority of revenues for that product in a very short period of time See Item 1 BusinessMarketing Distribution and Selected Marketed ProductsCompetition Our US composition of matter patent for Sensipar   a smallmolecule product expired in March 2018 We are engaged in litigation with a number of companies seeking to market generic versions of Sensipar  surrounding our US formulation patent that expires in September 2026 Several of these generic versions of Sensipar  have been approved by the FDA and the manufacturer of one of the approved generic versions began selling its product in late 2018 before reaching a settlement agreement with us in early January 2019 We were subsequently sued by a manufacturer of another approved generic version of Sensipar  who is contending that provisions of its own settlement agreement with Amgen have been triggered by the first manufacturers atrisk launch giving this second manufacturer a right to market its own generic version under its settlement agreement See Part IVNote 20 Contingencies and commitments to the Consolidated Financial Statements While no generic versions of Sensipar  are currently available for sale one or more other companies may elect to launch their approved generic versions atrisk prior to the conclusion of our ongoing litigation or may seek and obtain a judicial declaration that they are permitted to launch their generic versions If this happens our product sales for Sensipar  could be materially and adversely affected While we are unable to predict the precise impact of biosimilars and generics on our products we are currently facing and expect to face greater competition in the United States Europe and elsewhere this year and beyond as a result of biosimilar and 25 generic competition and downward pressure on our product prices and sales This competition has had and could increasingly have a material adverse effect on our product sales business and results of operations Our products face substantial competition We operate in a highly competitive environment See Item 1 BusinessMarketing Distribution and Selected Marketed ProductsCompetition We expect that our products will compete with new drugs currently in development drugs currently approved for other indications that may later be approved for the same indications as those of our products and drugs approved for other indications that are used offlabel Large pharmaceutical companies and generics manufacturers of pharmaceutical products are expanding into the biotechnology field and some pharmaceutical companies and generics manufacturers have formed partnerships to pursue biosimilars In addition some of our competitors may have technical competitive or other advantages over us for the development of technologies and processes or greater experience in particular therapeutic areas and consolidation among pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can enhance such advantages These advantages may make it difficult for us to compete with them to successfully discover develop and market new products and for our current products to compete with new products or new product indications they may bring to market As a result our products may compete against products that offer higher rebates or discounts lower prices equivalent or superior performance better safety profiles easier administration earlier market availability or other competitive features If we are unable to compete effectively this could reduce sales which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations Our intellectual property positions may be challenged invalidated or circumvented or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and defend patent rights and other intellectual property rights that are important to the commercialization of our products and product candidates The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and often involve complex legal scientific and factual questions Driven by cost pressures efforts to limit or weaken patent protection for our industry are increasing Third parties may challenge invalidate or circumvent our patents and patent applications relating to our products product candidates and technologies Challenges to patents may come from potential competitors or from parties other than those who seek to market a potentiallyinfringing product In addition our patent positions might not protect us against competitors with similar products or technologies because competing products or technologies may not infringe our patents For certain of our product candidates there are third parties who have patents or pending patent applications that they may claim necessitate payment of a royalty or prevent us from commercializing these product candidates in certain territories Patent disputes are frequent costly and can preclude delay or increase the cost of commercialization of products We have been in the past and are currently and expect to be in the future involved in patent litigation These matters have included and may in the future include litigation with manufacturers of products that purport to be biosimilars of certain of our products for patent infringement and for failure to comply with certain provisions of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act A determination made by a court agency or tribunal concerning infringement validity enforceability injunctive or economic remedy or the right to patent protection for example are typically subject to appellate or administrative review Upon review such initial determinations may be afforded little or no deference by the reviewing tribunal and may be affirmed reversed or made the subject of reconsideration through further proceedings A patent dispute or litigation may not discourage a potential violator from bringing the allegedlyinfringing product to market prior to a final resolution of the dispute or litigation The period from inception until resolution of a patent dispute or litigation is subject to the availability and schedule of the court agency or tribunal before which the dispute or litigation is pending We may be subject to competition during this period and may not be able to recover fully from the losses damages and harms we incur from infringement by the competitor product even if we prevail Moreover if we lose or settle current or future litigations at certain stages or entirely we could be subject to competition andor significant liabilities be required to enter into thirdparty licenses for the infringed product or technology or be required to cease using the technology or product in dispute In addition we cannot guarantee that such licenses will be available on terms acceptable to us or at all Further under the HatchWaxman Act our products approved by the FDA under the FDCA may be the subject of patent litigation with generics competitors before expiry of the fiveyear period of data exclusivity provided for under the HatchWaxman Act and prior to the expiration of the patents listed for the product Likewise our innovative biologic products may be the subject of patent litigation prior to the expiration of our patents and with respect to competitors seeking approval as a biosimilar or interchangeable version of our products prior to the 12year exclusivity period provided under the ACA In addition we are facing patent litigation involving claims that the biosimilar product candidates we are working to develop infringe the patents of other companies that manufacture market or sell the applicable reference products For example we are currently engaged in litigation in the United States regarding MVASI TM  KANJINTI TM and AMJEVITA TM  and in Europe we are engaged in litigation regarding AMGEVITA TM  While we may attempt to challenge the patents held by the companies manufacturing marketing or selling the applicable reference products our efforts may be unsuccessful Alternatively such patents may contribute to a decision by us to not pursue all of the same labeled indications as are held by these companies For information related to our patent litigation see Part IVNote 20 Contingencies and commitments to the Consolidated Financial Statements 26 Certain of the existing patents on our products have expired See Item 1 BusinessMarketing Distribution and Selected Marketed ProductsPatents As our patents expire competitors are able to legally produce and market similar products or technologies including biosimilars which may have a material adverse effect on our product sales business and results of operations In addition competitors may be able to invalidate design around or otherwise circumvent our patents and sell competing products Guidelines and recommendations published by various organizations can reduce the use of our products Government agencies promulgate regulations and guidelines directly applicable to us and to our products Professional societies practice management groups insurance carriers physicians groups private health and science foundations and organizations involved in various diseases also publish guidelines and recommendations to healthcare providers administrators and payers as well as patient communities Recommendations by government agencies or other groups and organizations may relate to such matters as usage dosage route of administration and use of related therapies In addition a growing number of organizations are providing assessments of the value and pricing of biopharmaceutical products and even organizations whose guidelines have historically been focused on clinical matters have begun to incorporate analyses of the cost effectiveness of various treatments into their treatment guidelines and recommendations Value assessments may come from private organizations that publish their findings and offer recommendations relating to the products reimbursement by government and private payers Some companies and payers have announced pricing and payment decisions based in part on the assessments of private organizations For example CVS Caremark indicated in August 2018 that it will begin utilizing thirdparty cost effectiveness analyses to make formulary and coverage determinations for newlyapproved drugs In addition government health technology assessment organizations in many countries make reimbursement recommendations to payers in their jurisdictions based on the clinical effectiveness costeffectiveness and service impact of new emerging and existing medicines and treatments Such health technology assessment organizations may recommend reimbursement for our product for a narrower indication than was approved by applicable regulatory agencies or may recommend against reimbursement entirely Such recommendations or guidelines may affect our reputation and any recommendations or guidelines that result in decreased use dosage or reimbursement of our products could have a material adverse effect on our product sales business and results of operations In addition the perception by the investment community or stockholders that such recommendations or guidelines will result in decreased use and dosage of our products could adversely affect the market price of our common stock Our current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval Our business is subject to extensive regulation by numerous state and federal government authorities in the United States including the FDA and by foreign regulatory authorities including the EMA We are required in the United States and in foreign countries to obtain approval from regulatory authorities before we manufacture market and sell our products Once our products are approved the FDA and other US and foreign regulatory agencies have substantial authority to require additional testing and reporting perform inspections change product labeling or mandate withdrawals of our products Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may subject us to administrative andor judicially imposed sanctions or monetary penalties as well as reputational and other harms The sanctions could include the FDAs or foreign regulatory authorities refusals to approve pending applications delays in obtaining or withdrawals of approvals delays or suspensions of clinical trials warning letters product recalls or seizures total or partial suspensions of our operations injunctions fines civil penalties andor criminal prosecutions Obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals have been and will continue to be increasingly difficult timeconsuming and costly Legislative bodies or regulatory agencies could enact new laws or regulations change existing laws or regulations or change their interpretations of laws or regulations at any time which could affect our ability to obtain or maintain approval of our products or product candidates The rate and degree of change in existing laws and regulations and regulatory expectations have accelerated in established markets and regulatory expectations continue to evolve in emerging markets We are unable to predict whether and when any further changes to laws or regulatory policies affecting our business could occur such as changes to laws or regulations governing manufacturer communications concerning drug products and drug product candidates and whether such changes could have a material adverse effect on our product sales business and results of operations In the United States a partial federal government shutdown halted the work of many federal agencies and their employees from late December 2018 through late January 2019 While federal employees have since returned to work a subsequent extended shutdown could result in reductions or delays of FDAs activities including with respect to our ongoing clinical programs our manufacturing of our products and product candidates and our product approvals Regulatory authorities may also question the sufficiency for approval of the endpoints we select for our clinical trials A number of our products and product candidates have been evaluated in clinical trials using surrogate endpoints that measure an effect that is known to correlate with an ultimate clinical endpoint For example a therapeutic oncology product candidate may be evaluated for its ability to extend the length of time during and after the treatment that a patient lives without the disease worsening measured by progressionfree survival PFS Demonstrating that the product candidate produces a statistically significant improvement in PFS does not necessarily mean that the product candidate will show a statistically significant improvement in overall survival or the time that the patients remain alive In the cardiovascular setting a heart disease therapeutic 27 candidate may be evaluated for its ability to reduce LDLC levels as elevated LDLC level has been a surrogate endpoint for cardiovascular events such as death heart attack and stroke The use of surrogate endpoints such as PFS and LDLC reduction in the absence of other measures of clinical benefit may not be sufficient for broad usage or approval even when such results are statistically significant Regulatory authorities could also add new requirements such as the completion of enrollment in a confirmatory study or the completion of an outcomes study or a meaningful portion of an outcomes study as conditions for obtaining approval or obtaining an indication For example our initial FDA application for Repatha  sought approval for a broader patient population based on data demonstrating that Repatha  reduced LDLC levels However the FDA initially approved Repatha  in 2015 only for a subset of those patients citing among other things the absence of positive outcomes data showing that Repatha  prevents cardiovascular events In December 2017 the FDA granted broader approval of Repatha  to reduce the risk of certain cardiovascular events and also to be used alone or in combination with other lipidlowering therapies for the treatment of adults with primary hyperlipidemia to reduce LDLC only after our large phase 3 outcomes study evaluating the ability of Repatha  to prevent cardiovascular events met its primary composite endpoint and key secondary composite endpoint There may also be situations in which demonstrating the efficacy and safety of a product candidate may not be sufficient to gain regulatory approval unless superiority to other existing treatment options can be shown The imposition of additional requirements or our inability to meet them in a timely fashion or at all may delay our clinical development and regulatory filing efforts delay or prevent us from obtaining regulatory approval for new product candidates or new indications for existing products or prevent us from maintaining our current labels Some of our products have been approved by US and foreign regulatory authorities on an accelerated or conditional basis with full approval conditioned upon fulfilling the requirements of regulators For example in March 2018 we announced that the FDA approved BLINCYTO  under accelerated approval for the treatment of adults and children with Bcell precursor ALL in first or second complete remission with minimal residual disease greater than or equal to 01 percent Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials Regulatory authorities are placing greater focus on monitoring products originally approved on an accelerated or conditional basis and on whether the sponsors of such products have met the conditions of the accelerated or conditional approvals If we are unable to fulfill the regulators requirements that were conditions of a products accelerated or conditional approval andor if regulators reevaluate the data or riskbenefit profile of our product the conditional approval may not result in full approval or may be revoked or not renewed Alternatively we may be required to change the products labeled indications or even withdraw the product from the market Safety problems or signals can arise as our products and product candidates are evaluated in clinical trials including investigator sponsored studies or as our marketed products are used in clinical practice We are required to continuously collect and assess adverse events reported to us and to communicate to regulatory agencies these adverse events and safety signals regarding our products Regulatory agencies periodically perform inspections of our pharmacovigilance processes including our adverse event reporting In the United States for our products with approved REMS see Item 1 BusinessGovernment RegulationPostapproval Phase we are required to submit periodic assessment reports to the FDA to demonstrate that the goals of the REMS are being met REMS and other risk management programs are designed to ensure that a drugs benefits outweigh the risks and vary in the elements they contain If the FDA is not satisfied with the results of the periodic assessment reports we submit for any of our REMS the FDA may also modify our REMS or take other regulatory actions such as implementing revised or restrictive labeling The drug delivery devices approved for use in combination with our products are also subject to regulatory oversight and review for safety and malfunctions If regulatory agencies determine that we or other parties including our clinical trial investigators those operating our patient support programs or licensees of our products have not complied with the applicable reporting other pharmacovigilance or other safety or quality assessment requirements we may become subject to additional inspections warning letters or other enforcement actions including fines marketing authorization withdrawal and other penalties Our product candidates and marketed products can also be affected by safety problems or signals occurring with respect to products that are similar to ours or that implicate an entire class of products Further as a result of clinical trials including subanalyses or metaanalyses of earlier clinical trials a metaanalysis involves the use of various statistical methods to combine results from previous separate but related studies performed by us or others concerns may arise about the sufficiency of the data or studies underlying a products approved label Such actual or perceived safety problems or concerns can lead to  revised or restrictive labeling for our products or the potential for restrictive labeling that may result in our decision not to commercialize a product candidate  requirement of risk management activities or other regulatory agency compliance actions related to the promotion and sale of our products  mandated postmarketing commitments or pharmacovigilance programs for our approved products  product recalls of our approved products 28  required changes to the processes used in the manufacture of our products which could increase our manufacturing costs and affect the availability of contract manufacturers we may utilize to assist in such manufacturing  revocation of approval for our products from the market completely or within particular therapeutic areas or patient types  increased timelines or delays in being approved by the FDA or other regulatory bodies andor  fewer treatments or product candidates being approved by regulatory bodies For example the FDA is currently evaluating our BLA for EVENITY TM for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk of fracture In January 2018 the FDAs BRUDAC recommended that the FDA approve EVENITY TM  but also suggested that the FDA require appropriate postmarketing review to evaluate a potential cardiovascular risk seen in one of the EVENITY TM pivotal clinical trials See Item 1 BusinessSignificant Developments While the FDA is not bound to follow the recommendations of its advisory committees it often does if the FDA approves EVENITY TM it may require that we complete a postmarketing study which could be time consuming and costly In addition to our innovative products we are working to develop and commercialize biosimilar versions of a number of products currently manufactured marketed and sold by other pharmaceutical companies In some markets there is not yet a legislative or regulatory pathway for the approval of biosimilars In the United States the ACA provided for such a pathway while the FDA continues to implement it discussions continue as to the evidence needed to demonstrate biosimilarity or interchangeability for specific products See We currently face competition from biosimilars and expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars and generics in the future Delays or uncertainties in the development or implementation of such pathways could result in delays or difficulties in getting our biosimilar products approved by regulatory authorities subject us to unanticipated development costs or otherwise reduce the value of the investments we have made in the biosimilars area Further we cannot predict whether any repeal or reform of the ACA would affect the biosimilar pathway or have a material adverse effect on our development of biosimilars or on our marketed biosimilars In addition if we are unable to bring our biosimilar products to market on a timely basis and secure firsttomarket or other advantageous positions our future biosimilar sales and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected We may not be able to develop commercial products despite significant investments in RD Amgen invests heavily in RD Successful product development in the biotechnology industry is highly uncertain and very few RD projects produce commercial products Product candidates including biosimilar product candidates or new indications for existing products collectively product candidates that appear promising in the early phases of development may fail to reach the market for a number of reasons such as  the product candidate did not demonstrate acceptable clinical trial results even though it demonstrated positive preclinical trial results for reasons that could include changes in the standard of care of medicine  the product candidate was not effective or not more effective than currently available therapies in treating a specified condition or illness  the product candidate was not cost effective in light of existing therapeutics  the product candidate had harmful side effects in animals or humans  the necessary regulatory bodies such as the FDA or EMA did not approve the product candidate for an intended use  the product candidate was not economical for us to manufacture and commercialize  other parties had or may have had proprietary rights relating to our product candidate such as patent rights and did not let us sell it on reasonable terms or at all  we and certain of our licensees partners contracted organizations or independent investigators may have failed to effectively conduct clinical development or clinical manufacturing activities  the pathway to regulatory approval or reimbursement for product candidates was uncertain or not welldefined and  the biosimilar product candidate failed to demonstrate the requisite biosimilarity to the applicable reference product or was otherwise determined by a regulatory authority to not meet applicable standards for approval We have spent considerable time energy and resources developing our expertise in human genetics with the belief that genetics could meaningfully aid our search for new medicines and help guide our research and development decisions and investments We have focused our RD strategy on drug targets validated by genetic or other compelling human evidence However 29 product candidates based on genetically validated targets remain subject to the uncertainties of the drug development process and may not reach the market for a number of reasons including the factors listed above A number of our product candidates have failed or been discontinued at various stages in the product development process For example in May 2015 we terminated our participation in the codevelopment and commercialization of brodalumab with AstraZeneca The decision was based on events of suicidal ideation and behavior in the brodalumab program which we believed likely would necessitate restrictive labeling that would limit the appropriate patient population Inability to bring a product to market or a significant delay in the expected approval and related launch date of a new product for any of the reasons discussed could potentially have a negative impact on our product sales and earnings and could result in a significant impairment of inprocess research and development IPRD or other intangible assets We must conduct clinical trials in humans before we commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications Before we sell any products we must conduct clinical trials to demonstrate that our product candidates are safe and effective for use in humans The results of those clinical trials are used as the basis to obtain approval from regulatory authorities such as the FDA and EMA See Our current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval  We are required to conduct clinical trials using an appropriate number of trial sites and patients to support the product label claims The length of time number of trial sites and number of patients required for clinical trials vary substantially and we may spend several years and incur substantial expense in completing certain clinical trials In addition we may have difficulty finding a sufficient number of clinical trial sites and patients to participate in our clinical trials particularly if competitors are conducting clinical trials in similar patient populations Patients may withdraw from clinical trials at any time and privacy laws andor other restrictions in certain countries may restrict the ability of clinical trial investigators to conduct further followup on such patients which may adversely affect the interpretation of study results Delays and complications in planned clinical trials can result in increased development costs associated delays in regulatory approvals and in product candidates reaching the market and revisions to existing product labels Further to increase the number of patients available for enrollment in our clinical trials we have and will continue to open clinical sites and enroll patients in a number of locations where our experience conducting clinical trials is more limited including Russia India China South Korea the Philippines Singapore and some Central and South American countries either through utilization of thirdparty contract clinical trial providers entirely or in combination with local staff Conducting clinical trials in locations where we have limited experience requires substantial time and resources to understand the unique regulatory environments of individual countries Further we must ensure the timely production distribution and delivery of the clinical supply of our product candidates to numerous and varied clinical trial sites If we fail to adequately manage the design execution and diverse regulatory aspects of our large and complex clinical trials or to manage the production or distribution of our clinical supply corresponding regulatory approvals may be delayed or we may fail to gain approval for our product candidates or could lose our ability to market existing products in certain therapeutic areas or altogether If we are unable to market and sell our products or product candidates or to obtain approvals in the timeframe needed to execute our product strategies our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected We rely on independent thirdparty clinical investigators to recruit patients and conduct clinical trials on our behalf in accordance with applicable study protocols laws and regulations Further we rely on unaffiliated thirdparty vendors to perform certain aspects of our clinical trial operations In some circumstances we enter into codevelopment arrangements with other pharmaceutical and medical devices companies that provide for the other company to conduct certain clinical trials for the product we are codeveloping or to develop a diagnostic test used in screening patients for our clinical trials See Some of our pharmaceutical pipeline and of our commercial product sales relies on collaborations with third parties which may adversely affect the development and sale of our products We also may acquire companies that have past or ongoing clinical trials or rights to products or product candidates for which clinical trials have been or are being conducted These trials may not have been conducted to the same standards as ours however once an acquisition has been completed we assume responsibility for the conduct of these trials including any potential risks and liabilities associated with the past and prospective conduct of those trials If regulatory authorities determine that we or others including our licensees or codevelopment partners or the independent investigators or vendors selected by us our codevelopment partners or by a company we have acquired or from which we have acquired rights to a product or product candidate have not complied with regulations applicable to the clinical trials those authorities may refuse or reject some or all of the clinical trial data or take other actions that could delay or otherwise negatively impact our ability to obtain or maintain marketing approval of the product or indication In addition delays or failures to develop diagnostic tests for our clinical trials can affect the timely enrollment of such trials and lead to delays or inability to obtain marketing approval If we were unable to market and sell our products or product candidates our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected In addition some of our clinical trials utilize drugs manufactured and marketed by other pharmaceutical companies These drugs may be administered in clinical trials in combination with one of our products or product candidates or in a headtohead 30 study comparing the products or product candidates relative efficacy and safety In the event that any of these vendors or pharmaceutical companies have unforeseen issues that negatively impact the quality of their work product or create a shortage of supply or if we are otherwise unable to obtain an adequate supply of these other drugs our ability to complete our applicable clinical trials andor evaluate clinical results may also be negatively impacted As a result such quality or supply problems could adversely affect our ability to timely file for gain or maintain regulatory approvals worldwide Clinical trials must be designed based on the current standard of medical care However in certain diseases such as cancer the standard of care is evolving rapidly In such diseases the duration of time needed to complete certain clinical trials may result in the design of such clinical trials being based on standards of medical care that are no longer the current standards by the time such trials are completed limiting the utility and application of such trials We may not obtain favorable clinical trial results and therefore may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for new product candidates or new indications for existing products andor maintain our current product labels Participants in clinical trials of our products and product candidates may also suffer adverse medical events or side effects that could among other factors delay or terminate clinical trial programs andor require additional or longer trials to gain approval Even after a product is on the market safety concerns may require additional or more extensive clinical trials as part of a risk management plan for our product or for approval of a new indication For example in connection with the June 2011 ESA label changes we agreed to and conducted additional clinical trials examining the use of ESAs in CKD Additional clinical trials we initiate including those required by the FDA could result in substantial additional expense and the outcomes could result in further label restrictions or the loss of regulatory approval for an approved indication each of which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales business and results of operations Additionally any negative results from such trials could materially affect the extent of approvals the use reimbursement and sales of our products our business and results of operations Some of our products are used with drug delivery or companion diagnostic devices that have their own regulatory manufacturing and other risks Many of our products and product candidates may be used in combination with a drug delivery device such as an injector or other delivery system For example Neulasta  is available as part of the Neulasta  Onpro  kit and our AutoTouch  reusable autoinjector is used with Enbrel Mini  singledose prefilled cartridges In addition some of our products or product candidates may also require the use of a companion diagnostic device such as a device that determines whether the patient is eligible to use our drug or that helps ensure its safe and effective use Our product candidates or expanded indications of our products used with such devices may not be approved or may be substantially delayed in receiving regulatory approval if development of such devices is delayed such devices do not also gain or maintain regulatory approval or clearance or if such devices do not remain commercially available When approval of the product and device is sought under a single marketing drug application the increased complexity of the review process may delay receipt of regulatory approval In addition some of these devices may be provided by singlesource unaffiliated thirdparty companies We are dependent on the sustained cooperation and effort of those thirdparty companies both to supply the devices and in some cases to conduct the studies required for approval or clearance by the applicable regulatory agencies We are also dependent on those thirdparty companies continuing to meet applicable regulatory or other requirements Failure to successfully develop modify or supply the devices delays in or failures of the Amgen or thirdparty studies or failure of us or the thirdparty companies to obtain or maintain regulatory approval or clearance of the devices could result in increased development costs delays in or failure to obtain or maintain regulatory approval andor associated delays in a product candidate reaching the market or in the addition of new indications for existing products We are also required to collect and assess user complaints adverse events and malfunctions regarding our devices and actual or perceived safety problems or concerns with a device used with our product can lead to regulatory actions and impacts to our products See Our current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval Additionally regulatory agencies conduct routine monitoring and conduct inspections to identify and evaluate potential issues with our devices For example in 2017 the FDA reported on its adverse event reporting system that it is evaluating our Neulasta  Onpro  kit Loss of regulatory approval or clearance of a device that is used with our product may also result in the removal of our product from the market Further failure to successfully develop supply or gain or maintain approval for these devices could adversely affect sales of the related approved products Some of our pharmaceutical pipeline and of our commercial product sales relies on collaborations with third parties which may adversely affect the development and sale of our products We depend on alliances with other companies including pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies vendors and service providers for the development of a portion of the products in our pharmaceutical pipeline and for the commercialization and sales of certain of our commercial products For example we have collaborations with third parties under which we share development rights obligations and costs andor commercial rights and obligations See Item 1 BusinessBusiness Relationships Failures by these parties to meet their contractual regulatory or other obligations to us or any disruption in the relationships between us and these third parties could have a material adverse effect on our pharmaceutical pipeline and business In addition our collaborative relationships for research and development andor commercialization and sales often extend for many years and 31 may give rise to disputes regarding the relative rights obligations and revenues of us and our collaboration partners including the ownership or prosecution of intellectual property and associated rights and obligations This could result in the loss of intellectual property rights or protection delay the development and sale of potential pharmaceutical products impact the effective sale and delivery of our commercialized products and lead to lengthy and expensive litigation administrative proceedings or arbitration The adoption and interpretation of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability We are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and other jurisdictions in which we do business As a result our provision for income taxes is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various places we operate Significant judgment is required for determining our provision for income tax Our tax returns are routinely examined by tax authorities in the United States and other jurisdictions in which we do business and a number of audits are currently underway Tax authorities including the Internal Revenue Service IRS are becoming more aggressive in their audits and are particularly focused on the allocations of income and expense among tax jurisdictions As previously disclosed we received a Revenue Agent Report RAR from the IRS for the years 2010 2011 and 2012 The RAR proposes to make significant adjustments that relate primarily to the allocation of profits between certain of our entities in the United States and the US territory of Puerto Rico In November 2017 we received a modified RAR that revised the IRSs calculation but continued to propose substantial adjustments We disagree with the proposed adjustments and are pursuing resolution with the IRS administrative appeals office which currently has jurisdiction over the matter If we deem necessary we will vigorously contest the proposed adjustments through the judicial process Although final resolution of this complex matter is not likely within the next 12 months such resolution could have a material negative impact on our consolidated financial statements We believe our accrual for income tax liabilities is appropriate based on past experience interpretations of tax law and judgments about potential actions by tax authorities however due to the complexity of the provision for income taxes the ultimate resolution of any tax matters may result in payments greater or less than amounts accrued Our provision for income taxes and results of operations in the future could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure changes in the mix of income and expenses in countries with differing tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in applicable tax laws regulations or administrative interpretations thereof The 2017 Tax Act is complex and further regulations and interpretations are still being issued We could face audit challenges on how we apply the new law that could have a negative impact on our provision for income taxes A change to the US tax system such as a repeal or modification of the 2017 Tax Act a change to the tax system in a jurisdiction where we have significant operations such as the US territory of Puerto Rico or changes in tax law in the United States or other jurisdictions where we do business could have a material and adverse effect on our business and on the results of our operations We perform a substantial majority of our commercial manufacturing activities at our facility in the US territory of Puerto Rico and a substantial majority of our clinical manufacturing activities at our facility in Thousand Oaks California significant disruptions or production failures at these facilities could significantly impair our ability to supply our products or continue our clinical trials The global supply of our products and product candidates for commercial sales and for use in our clinical trials is significantly dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of our manufacturing facilities in particular those in the US territory of Puerto Rico and Thousand Oaks California See Manufacturing difficulties disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales  We currently perform a substantial majority of our clinical manufacturing activities at our facility in Thousand Oaks California A substantial disruption in our ability to operate our Thousand Oaks California manufacturing facility could materially and adversely affect our ability to supply our product candidates for use in our clinical trials leading to delays in development of our product candidates In addition we currently perform a substantial majority of our commercial manufacturing activities at our facility in the US territory of Puerto Rico In late September 2017 Hurricane Maria made landfall on the island of Puerto Rico The hurricane destroyed residential and commercial buildings agriculture communications networks and most of Puerto Ricos electric grid While the critical manufacturing areas of our commercial manufacturing facility were not significantly impacted by the storm the restoration of electrical service on the island was a slow process and our facility operated with electrical power from backup diesel powered generators for some time In January 2018 we reconnected to the Puerto Rico electric grid but have continued to use diesel generators as needed when sufficient electric power has not been reliably available Further instability of the electric grid could require us to increase the use of our generators or even return to using them exclusively In addition future storms or other disasters or events could cause a more significant impact to our manufacturing operations A substantial disruption in our ability to operate our Puerto Rico manufacturing facility whether due to problems with the facility itself the infrastructure and services available on the island the unavailability of raw materials or supplies from vendors the unavailability of key staff or otherwise or get supplies and manufactured products transported to and from that location could materially and adversely affect 32 our ability to supply our products and affect our product sales See Manufacturing difficulties disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales  The impact of Hurricane Maria placed greater stress on the islands already challenged economy Prior to Hurricane Maria the government of Puerto Rico was unable to pay its roughly 72 billion in debt In June 2016 the US Congress passed the Puerto Rico Oversight Management and Economic Stability Act PROMESA which established a Financial Oversight and Management Board Oversight Board to provide fiscal oversight through the development and approval of fiscal plans and budgets for Puerto Rico and to assist in its debt restructuring In May 2017 after negotiations for debt restructuring with creditors were unsuccessful the Oversight Board approved and certified the filing in the US District Court for the District of Puerto Rico of a voluntary petition under Title III of PROMESA for the government of Puerto Rico and certain of its governmental entities including the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority PREPA Title III of PROMESA provides Puerto Rico with a judicial process for restructuring its debt similar to but not identical to Chapter 9 of the US Bankruptcy Code The Governor of Puerto Rico declared a state of emergency and authorized a moratorium on the payment of general obligation bonds and other debts issued by certain instrumentalities which moratorium has been extended and may continue to be extended while the Oversight Board is in effect Given the severe conditions in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria resolution of Puerto Ricos debt situation through the PROMESA judicial process has been delayed In the case of PREPA the effects of Hurricane Maria and several changes in PREPAs management have delayed reconstruction efforts In June 2018 the Oversight Board certified a budget for Puerto Ricos fiscal year 2019 that imposes significant expense reductions across the government The Title III Court upheld government challenges to the budget and the Governor and Legislature of Puerto Rico have now filed appeals before the US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit In addition certain nongovernmental entities have brought suit claiming the appointment process of the Oversight Board members set forth in PROMESA conflicts with the appointments clause of the US Constitution If the First Circuit were to hold that PROMESA has a constitutional infirmity and that actions taken by the Oversight Board are invalid the commencement of all Title III proceedings could be invalid In such event the current debt restructuring process and the debtholder litigation stay under Title III of PROMESA could be in jeopardy In October 2018 the fiscal plan for Puerto Rico was updated including a projected increase in federal disaster funding and projected material deficits once the stimulus effects of the disaster recovery dissipate The fiscal plan stresses the importance of structural reforms to address Puerto Ricos challenging economic and demographic trends that may be difficult to implement as well as have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements In addition the 2017 Tax Act will no longer permit deferral of US taxation on Puerto Rico earnings of US companies or their foreign subsidiaries although these earnings generally will be taxed in the United States at a reduced 105 rate Given Puerto Ricos challenged economy and hurricane recovery needs it may be difficult for Puerto Rico to sustain or grow its manufacturing base due to competition from other foreign locations subject to a similar level of US taxation or US locations due to the reduction in the US corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 The manufacturing sector contributes more than 45 of Puerto Ricos gross domestic product and multinational companies with Puerto Rico operations contribute approximately 30 of Puerto Ricos revenue base While PROMESA and the actions above continue to be important factors in moving Puerto Rico toward economic stability there is still a risk that Puerto Ricos ongoing economic challenges the effects of Hurricane Maria and the potential impact of the 2017 Tax Act could negatively affect the territorial governments provision of utilities or other services in Puerto Rico that we use in the operation of our business create the potential for increased taxes or fees to operate in Puerto Rico result in a migration of workers from Puerto Rico to the mainland United States or make it more expensive or difficult for us to operate in Puerto Rico which could materially and adversely affect our ability to supply our products and affect our product sales We rely on thirdparty suppliers for certain of our raw materials medical devices and components We rely on unaffiliated thirdparty suppliers for certain raw materials medical devices and components necessary for the manufacturing of our commercial and clinical products Certain of those raw materials medical devices and components are proprietary products of those unaffiliated thirdparty suppliers and are specifically cited in our drug applications with regulatory agencies so that they must be obtained from that specific sole source or sources and could not be obtained from another supplier unless and until the regulatory agency approved such supplier For example Insulet Corporation is our singlesource of the onbody injector for our Neulasta  Onpro  kit Also certain of the raw materials required in the commercial and clinical manufacturing of our products are sourced from other countries andor derived from biological sources including mammalian tissues bovine serum and human serum albumin Among the reasons we may be unable to obtain these raw materials medical devices and components include  regulatory requirements or action by regulatory agencies or others  adverse financial or other strategic developments at or affecting the supplier including bankruptcy 33  unexpected demand for or shortage of raw materials medical devices or components  failure to comply with our quality standards which results in quality and product failures product contamination andor recall  a material shortage contamination recall andor restrictions on the use of certain biologically derived substances or other raw materials  discovery of previously unknown or undetected imperfections in raw materials medical devices or components and  labor disputes or shortages including from the effects of health emergencies and natural disasters For example in prior years we have experienced shortages in certain components necessary for the formulation fill and finish of certain of our products in our Puerto Rico facility Further quality issues that result in unexpected additional demand for certain components may lead to shortages of required raw materials or components such as we have experienced with EPOGEN  glass vials We may experience similar or other shortages in the future resulting in delayed shipments supply constraints clinical trial delays contract disputes andor stockouts of our products These or other similar events could negatively impact our ability to satisfy demand for our products or conduct clinical trials which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales business and results of operations Manufacturing difficulties disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales Manufacturing biologic human therapeutic products is difficult complex and highly regulated We currently are involved in the manufacture of many of our products and plan to manufacture many of our product candidates In addition we currently use thirdparty contract manufacturers to produce or assist in the production of a number of our products and we currently use contract manufacturers to produce or assist in the production of a number of our latestage product candidates and drug delivery devices See Item 1 BusinessManufacturing Distribution and Raw MaterialsManufacturing Our ability to adequately and timely manufacture and supply our products and product candidates to support our clinical trials is dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of our facilities and those of our thirdparty contract manufacturers which may be impacted by  capacity of manufacturing facilities  contamination by microorganisms or viruses or foreign particles from the manufacturing process  natural or other disasters including hurricanes earthquakes volcanoes or fires  labor disputes or shortages including the effects of health emergencies or natural disasters  compliance with regulatory requirements  changes in forecasts of future demand  timing and actual number of production runs and production success rates and yields  updates of manufacturing specifications  contractual disputes with our suppliers and contract manufacturers  timing and outcome of product quality testing  power failures andor other utility failures  breakdown failure substandard performance or improper installation or operation of equipment andor  delays in the ability of the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies to provide us necessary reviews inspections and approvals including as a result of a subsequent extended US federal government shutdown If any of these or other problems affect production in one or more of our facilities or those of our thirdparty contract manufacturers or if we do not accurately forecast demand for our products or the amount of our product candidates required in clinical trials we may be unable to increase production in our unaffected facilities to meet demand If the efficient manufacture and supply of our products or product candidates is interrupted we may experience delayed shipments delays in our clinical trials supply constraints stockouts adverse event trends contract disputes andor recalls of our products From time to time we have initiated recalls of certain lots of our products For example in July 2014 we initiated a voluntary recall of an Aranesp  lot distributed in the EU after particles were detected in a quality control sample following distribution of that lot and in April 2018 we initiated a precautionary recall of two batches of Vectibix  distributed in Switzerland after potential crimping defects were discovered in the metal seals on the product vials If we are at any time unable to provide an uninterrupted supply of our products to patients 34 we may lose patients and physicians may elect to prescribe competing therapeutics instead of our products which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales business and results of operations Our manufacturing processes those of our thirdparty contract manufacturers and those of certain of our thirdparty service providers must undergo regulatory approval processes and are subject to continued review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities It can take longer than five years to build validate and license another manufacturing plant and it can take longer than three years to qualify and license a new contract manufacturer or service provider If we elect or are required to make changes to our manufacturing processes because of new regulatory requirements new interpretations of existing requirements or other reasons this could increase our manufacturing costs and result in delayed shipments delays in our clinical trials supply constraints stockouts adverse event trends or contract negotiations or disputes Such manufacturing challenges may also occur if our existing contract manufacturers are unable or unwilling to implement such changes If regulatory authorities determine that we or our thirdparty contract manufacturers or certain of our thirdparty service providers have violated regulations or if authorities restrict suspend or revoke our prior approvals they could prohibit us from manufacturing our products or conducting clinical trials or selling our marketed products until we or the affected thirdparty contract manufacturers or thirdparty service providers comply or indefinitely Such issues may also delay the approval of product candidates we have submitted for regulatory review even if such product candidates are not directly related to the products devices or processes at issue with regulators Because our thirdparty contract manufacturers and certain of our thirdparty service providers are subject to the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities alternative qualified thirdparty contract manufacturers and thirdparty service providers may not be available on a timely basis or at all If we or our thirdparty contract manufacturers or thirdparty service providers cease or interrupt production or if our thirdparty contract manufacturers and thirdparty service providers fail to supply materials products or services to us we may experience delayed shipments delays in our clinical trials supply constraints contract disputes stockouts andor recalls of our products Additionally we distribute a substantial volume of our commercial products through our primary distribution centers in Louisville Kentucky for the United States and in Breda Netherlands for Europe and much of the rest of the world We also conduct all the labeling and packaging of our products distributed in Europe and much of the rest of the world in Breda Our ability to timely supply products is dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operations of our distribution and logistics centers our thirdparty logistics providers and our labeling and packaging facility in Breda Further we rely on commercial transportation including air and sea freight for the distribution of our products to our customers which may be negatively impacted by natural disasters or security threats Concentration of sales at certain of our wholesaler distributors and at one freestanding dialysis clinic business and consolidation of private payers may negatively impact our business Certain of our distributors customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage due to the volume of our products they purchase or the number of patient lives for which they provide coverage The substantial majority of our US product sales is made to three pharmaceutical product wholesaler distributors AmerisourceBergen Corporation McKesson Corporation and Cardinal Health Inc These distributors in turn sell our products to their customers which include physicians or their clinics dialysis centers hospitals and pharmacies One of our products EPOGEN   is sold primarily to freestanding dialysis clinics DaVita owns or manages a large number of the outpatient dialysis facilities located in the United States and accounts for approximately 70 of all EPOGEN  sales Similarly as discussed above there has been significant consolidation in the health insurance industry including that a small number of PBMs now oversee a substantial percentage of total covered lives in the United States See Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from thirdparty payers and pricing and reimbursement pressures may affect our profitability  The three largest PBMs in the United States are now part of major health insurance providers The growing concentration of purchasing and negotiating power by these entities may put pressure on our pricing due to their ability to extract price discounts on our products fees for other services or rebates negatively impacting our bargaining position sales andor profit margins In addition decisions by these entities to purchase or cover less or none of our products in favor of competitive products could have a material adverse effect on our product sales business and results of operations due to their purchasing volume Further if one of our significant wholesale distributors encounters financial or other difficulties and becomes unable or unwilling to pay us all amounts that such distributor owes us on a timely basis or at all it could negatively impact our business and results of operations In addition if one of our significant wholesale distributors becomes insolvent or otherwise unable to continue its commercial relationship with us in its present form it could significantly disrupt our business and adversely affect our product sales our business and results of operations unless suitable alternatives are timely found or lost sales are absorbed by another distributor Our efforts to acquire other companies or products and to integrate their operations may not be successful and may result in unanticipated costs delays or failures to realize the benefits of the transactions We seek innovation through significant investment in both internal RD and external transactions including collaborations partnering alliances licenses joint ventures mergers and acquisitions acquisition activity We have an ongoing process of evaluating such potential acquisition activity opportunities that we expect will contribute to our future growth and expand our geographic footprint product offerings andor our RD pipeline Acquisitions or similar arrangements may be complex time 35 consuming and expensive and may result in unanticipated costs delays or other operational or financial problems related to integrating the acquired company and business with our company which may result in the diversion of our managements attention from other business issues and opportunities We may pay substantial amounts of cash incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for acquisition activities which could adversely affect our liquidity or result in dilution to our stockholders respectively Failures or difficulties in integrating or retaining new personnel or in integrating the operations of the businesses we acquire including their technology compliance programs distribution and general business operations and procedures while preserving important RD distribution marketing promotion and other relationships may affect our ability to grow and may result in our incurring asset impairment or restructuring charges Our sales and operations are subject to the risks of doing business internationally including in emerging markets As we continue our expansion efforts in emerging markets around the world through acquisitions and licensing transactions as well as through the development and introduction of our products in new markets we face numerous risks to our business There is no guarantee that our efforts and strategies to expand sales in emerging markets will succeed Emerging market countries may be especially vulnerable to periods of global and local political legal regulatory and financial instability including sovereign debt issues andor the imposition of international sanctions in response to certain state actions We may also be required to increase our reliance on thirdparty agents and unfamiliar operations and arrangements previously utilized by companies we partner with or acquire in emerging markets See We must conduct clinical trials in humans before we commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications  As we expand internationally we are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the US dollar While we have a program in place that is designed to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations through foreign currency hedging arrangements our hedging efforts do not completely offset the effect of these fluctuations on our revenues and earnings Our international operations and business may also be subject to less protective intellectual property or other applicable laws diverse data privacy and protection requirements changing tax laws and tariffs trade restrictions or other barriers designed to protect industry in the home country against foreign competition farreaching antibribery and anticorruption laws and regulations andor evolving legal and regulatory environments These legal and operational challenges along with government controls the challenges of attracting and retaining qualified personnel and obtaining andor maintaining necessary regulatory or pricing approvals of our products may result in a material adverse impact on our international product sales business and results of operations Our business may be affected by litigation and government investigations We and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in legal proceedings See Part IVNote 20 Contingencies and commitments to the Consolidated Financial Statements Civil and criminal litigation is inherently unpredictable and the outcome can result in costly verdicts fines and penalties exclusion from federal healthcare programs andor injunctive relief that affect how we operate our business Defense of litigation claims can be expensive time consuming and distracting and it is possible that we could incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims for monetary damages or change the way we operate our business which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales business and results of operations In addition product liability is a major risk in testing and marketing biotechnology and pharmaceutical products We may face substantial product liability exposure in human clinical trials and for products we sell after regulatory approval Product liability claims regardless of their merits could be costly and divert managements attention and could adversely affect our reputation and the demand for our products We and certain of our subsidiaries have previously been named as defendants in product liability actions for certain of our products We are also involved in government investigations that arise in the ordinary course of our business In recent years there has been a trend of increasing government investigations and litigations against companies operating in our industry both in the United States and around the world Our business activities outside of the United States are subject to the FCPA and similar antibribery or anticorruption laws regulations or rules of other countries in which we operate including the UK Bribery Act We cannot ensure that all our employees agents contractors vendors licensees partners or collaborators will comply with all applicable laws and regulations In 2012 we finalized a settlement agreement with the US government and various other parties to settle certain allegations regarding our sales and marketing practices and agreed to operate under a corporate integrity agreement with the OIG of the US Department of Health and Human Services which was formally closed out in August 2018 We may see new government investigations of or actions against us citing novel theories of recovery Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations A breakdown cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality integrity and availability of our information technology systems and networkconnected control systems and our data interrupt the operation of our business and affect our reputation To achieve our business objectives we rely to a large extent upon sophisticated information technology systems and networkconnected control systems some of which are managed hosted provided or serviced by third parties Internal or external events that compromise the confidentiality integrity and availability of our systems and data may significantly interrupt the operation of our business result in significant costs andor affect our reputation 36 Our information technology systems are highly integrated into our business including our RD efforts our clinical and commercial manufacturing processes and our product sales and distribution processes The complexity and interconnected nature of our systems makes them potentially vulnerable to breakdown or other service interruptions Our systems are also subject to frequent cyberattacks As the cyberthreat landscape evolves these attacks are growing in frequency sophistication and intensity and are becoming increasingly difficult to detect Such attacks could include the use of key loggers or other harmful and virulent malware including ransomware or other denials of service and can be deployed through malicious websites the use of social engineering andor other means Attacks such as those seen with other multinational companies including some of our peers could leave us unable to utilize key business systems or access important data needed to operate our business including developing gaining regulatory approval for manufacturing selling and distributing our products For example in 2017 a pharmaceutical company experienced a cyberattack involving virulent malware that significantly disrupted its operations including its research and sales operations and the production of some of its medicines and vaccines As a result of the cyberattack its orders and sales for certain products in certain markets were negatively impacted Our systems also contain and utilize a high volume of sensitive data including intellectual property trade secrets financial information regulatory information strategic plans sales trends and forecasts litigation materials or personal information belonging to us our staff our patients customers andor other business partners In some cases we utilize thirdparty service providers to process store manage or transmit such data which may increase our risk Intentional or inadvertent data privacy or security breaches including cyberattacks by employees service providers nation states organized crime organizations hacktivists or others pose risks that our sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons our competitors or the public Finally domestic and global government regulators our key business partners suppliers with whom we do business companies that provide us or our partners with important business services and companies we may acquire may face similar risks and security breaches of their systems could adversely affect our security leave us without access to important systems products raw materials components services or information or expose our confidential data For example we distribute our products in the United States primarily through three pharmaceutical wholesalers and a security breach that impairs the distribution operations of our wholesalers could significantly impair our ability to deliver our products to healthcare providers Although in the past we have experienced system breakdowns attacks and information security breaches we do not believe such breakdowns attacks and breaches have had a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations We continue to invest in the monitoring protection and resilience of our critical or sensitive data and systems However there can be no assurance that our efforts will detect prevent or fully recover systems or data from all breakdowns service interruptions attacks or breaches of our systems that could adversely affect our business and operations andor result in the loss of critical or sensitive data which could result in financial legal business or reputational harm to us or impact our stock price While we maintain cyberliability insurance our insurance is not sufficient to cover us against all losses that could potentially result from a service interruption breach of our systems or loss of our critical or sensitive data Global economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business Our operations and performance have been and may continue to be affected by global economic conditions Financial pressures may cause government or other thirdparty payers to more aggressively seek cost containment measures See Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from thirdparty payers and pricing and reimbursement pressures may affect our profitability  As a result of global economic conditions some thirdparty payers may delay or be unable to satisfy their reimbursement obligations Job losses or other economic hardships may also affect patients ability to afford health care as a result of increased copay or deductible obligations greater cost sensitivity to existing copay or deductible obligations lost healthcare insurance coverage or for other reasons We believe such conditions have led and could continue to lead to reduced demand for our products which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales business and results of operations Economic conditions may also adversely affect the ability of our distributors customers and suppliers to obtain the liquidity required to buy inventory or raw materials and to perform their obligations under agreements with us which could disrupt our operations Although we monitor our distributors customers and suppliers financial condition and their liquidity to mitigate our business risks some of our distributors customers and suppliers may become insolvent which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales business and results of operations We maintain a significant portfolio of investments disclosed as cash equivalents and marketable securities on our consolidated balance sheets The value of our investments may be adversely affected by interest rate fluctuations downgrades in credit ratings illiquidity in the capital markets and other factors that may result in otherthantemporary declines in the value of our investments Any of those events could cause us to record impairment charges with respect to our investment portfolio or to realize losses on sales of investments Our stock price is volatile Our stock price like that of our peers in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries is volatile Our revenues and operating results may fluctuate from period to period for a number of reasons Events such as a delay in product development changes to our expectations or strategy or even a relatively small revenue shortfall may cause financial results for a period to be 37 below our expectations or projections As a result our revenues and operating results and in turn our stock price may be subject to significant fluctuations Announcements or discussions including via social media channels of possible restrictive actions by government or private payers that would impact our business or industry if ultimately enacted or adopted may also cause our stock price to fluctuate whether or not such restrictive actions ever actually occur Similarly actual or perceived safety issues with our products or similar products or unexpected clinical trial results can have an immediate and rapid impact on our stock price whether or not our operating results are materially impacted We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us or at all The capital and credit markets may experience extreme volatility and disruption which may lead to uncertainty and liquidity issues for both borrowers and investors We expect to access the capital markets to supplement our existing funds and cash generated from operations in satisfying our needs for working capital capital expenditure and debt service requirements our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock and other business initiatives we plan to strategically pursue including acquisitions and licensing activities In the event of adverse capital and credit market conditions we may be unable to obtain capital market financing on similar favorable terms or at all which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations Changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized creditrating agencies could adversely affect our ability to obtain capital market financing and the cost of such financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities Item 1B UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None 38 Item 2 PROPERTIES As of December 31 2018  we owned or leased approximately 190 properties The locations and primary functions of significant properties are summarized in the following tables Excluded from the information above are i undeveloped land and leased properties that have been abandoned and ii certain buildings that we still own but are no longer used in our business There are no material encumbrances on our owned properties We believe that our facilities are suitable for their intended uses and in conjunction with our thirdparty contracting manufacturing agreements provide adequate capacity and are sufficient to meet our expected needs See Item 1A Risk Factors for a discussion of the factors that could adversely impact our manufacturing operations and the global supply of our products See Item 1 BusinessManufacturing Distribution and Raw Materials Item 3 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Certain of the legal proceedings in which we are involved are discussed in Part IVNote 20
