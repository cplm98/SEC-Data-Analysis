since the filing of our Annual Report on Form 10K for the year ended December 31 2019 COVID19 pandemic A novel strain of coronavirus SARSCoV2 or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 causing coronavirus disease 19 or COVID19 was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization WHO on March 11 2020 Since the first quarter of 2020 and continuing into 2021 we have seen some impact of the pandemic to our operations We continue to monitor and respond as the pandemic evolves to ensure the continued development manufacture and distribution of our medicines For further discussion see Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsOverview Selected Financial Information and Results of Operations For a discussion of the risks presented by the COVID19 pandemic to our results see Risk Factors in Item 1A Also see the remainder of Item 1 Business for discussion of pandemicrelated impacts to our overall business ProductsPipeline OncologyHematology KYPROLIS  carfilzomib  In August 2020 we announced that the US Food and Drug Administration FDA had approved the expansion of the KYPROLIS  US prescribing information to include its use in combination with DARZALEX  daratumumab plus dexamethasone in two dosing regimensonce weekly and twice weeklyfor the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received one to three previous lines of therapy Sotorasib formerly AMG 510  In September 2020 we announced updated phase 1 data evaluating sotorasib in 129 patients across multiple advanced solid tumors with Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog  KRAS G12C mutation which were published in the New England Journal of Medicine Data from 59 patients with advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer NSCLC were also featured in an oral presentation at a September 2020 medical conference In the patients with advanced NSCLC who were treated with the 960 mg daily dose the confirmed objective response rate ORR was 353 Across all dose levels the confirmed ORR was 322 with median duration of response of 109 months and median progressionfree survival PFS of 63 months 10 of 19 responders were still in response as of the data cutoff  In October 2020 we announced topline phase 2 results in 126 patients with KRAS G12C mutant advanced NSCLC Sotorasib demonstrated an ORR primary endpoint consistent with previously reported phase 1 data in patients taking the 960 mg daily dose Other measures of efficacy including duration of response were promising and more than half of the responders were still on treatment and continuing to respond as of the data cutoff date The results of this phase 2 study are potentially registrational and a phase 3 confirmatory study comparing sotorasib to docetaxel is currently recruiting patients with KRAS G12C mutant advanced NSCLC 1  In December 2020 we announced that the FDA had granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for our investigational KRAS G12C inhibitor sotorasib for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with KRAS G12C mutation as determined by an FDAapproved test following at least one prior systemic therapy Following this announcement we submitted a New Drug Application NDA to the FDA The sotorasib NDA is being reviewed by the FDAs RealTime Oncology Review RTOR pilot program which aims to explore a more efficient review process that ensures safe and effective treatments are made available to patients as early as possible Later in December we also submitted a Marketing Authorization Application MAA to the European Medicines Agency EMA  In January 2021 we announced results from the phase 2 cohort of the clinical study evaluating sotorasib in 126 patients with KRAS G12C mutant advanced NSCLC Sotorasib demonstrated a confirmed ORR and disease control rate of 371 and 806 respectively a median duration of response of 10 months and median progressionfree survival of 68 months In addition sotorasib was granted Breakthrough Therapy designation by the Center for Drug Evaluation of the National Medical Products Administration in China RIABNI TM rituximabarrx formerly ABP 798  In December 2020 we announced that the FDA had approved RIABNI TM  a biosimilar to Rituxan  rituximab for the treatment of adult patients with nonHodgkins lymphoma chronic lymphocytic leukemia granulomatosis with polyangiitis Wegeners granulomatosis and microscopic polyangiitis RIABNI TM launched in the United States in January 2021 Inflammation Otezla  apremilast  In May 2020 we announced positive topline results from a phase 3 study to assess the efficacy of Otezla  in adults with mildtomoderate plaque psoriasis The study showed that oral Otezla  30 mg twice daily achieved a statistically significant improvement compared with placebo in the primary endpoint of the static Physicians Global Assessment sPGA response defined as an sPGA score of clear 0 or almost clear 1 with at least a 2point reduction from baseline at week 16 Enbrel  etanercept  In July 2020 the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the judgment by the US District Court for the District of New Jersey upholding the validity of the two patents that describe and claim ENBREL and methods for making it See Note 19 Contingencies and commitments to the Consolidated Financial Statements Tezepelumab  In November 2020 we and AstraZeneca plc AstraZeneca announced positive topline results from the registrational phase 3 NAVIGATOR trial in adults and adolescents with severe uncontrolled asthma The trial met the primary endpoint with tezepelumab added to standard of care SoC demonstrating a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction compared with placebo plus SoC in the annualized asthma exacerbation rate AAER over 52 weeks in the overall patient population SoC consisted of medium or highdose inhaled corticosteroids ICS plus at least one additional controller medication with or without oral corticosteroids OCS We expect to submit results of this study to regulators in 2021  In December 2020 we and AstraZeneca announced that the SOURCE trial had not met the primary endpoint of a statistically significant reduction in the daily OCS dose without loss of asthma control with tezepelumab compared to placebo The results of this trial have no impact on our submission plans Cardiovascular Omecamtiv mecarbil  In November 2020 based on results of the omecamtiv mecarbil phase 3 trial we provided notice to Cytokinetics Incorporated Cytokinetics of termination of our collaboration and our intention to transition to them the development and commercialization rights for omecamtiv mecarbil and AMG 594 2 Establishment of wholly owned affiliate in Japan  In April 2020 we completed our purchase from Astellas of the remaining shares of Amgen Astellas BioPharma KK AABP a joint venture between Amgen and Astellas established in 2013 AABP now a wholly owned Amgen affiliate in Japan and renamed Amgen KK has enabled us to build a strong presence in Japan as we continue to advance treatments for serious illnesses The purchase did not have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements Marketing Distribution and Selected Marketed Products The largest concentration of our sales and marketing forces is based in the United States and Europe In addition we continue to expand the commercialization and marketing of our products into other geographic territories including parts of Asia the Middle East Canada and Latin America This expansion is occurring by establishing our own affiliates by acquiring existing thirdparty businesses or product rights or by collaborating with third parties See Business Relationships for our significant alliances Whether we use our own sales and marketing forces or a third partys varies across these markets Such use typically depends on several factors including the nature of entry into the new market the size of an opportunity and operational capabilities Together with our collaborators we market our products to healthcare providers including physicians or their clinics dialysis centers hospitals and pharmacies In the United States substantially all of our sales are to pharmaceutical wholesale distributors which are the principal means of distributing our products to healthcare providers We also market certain products through directtoconsumer channels including print television and online media For further discussion see Government RegulationRegulation in the United StatesRegulation of Product Marketing and Promotion Outside the United States we sell principally to healthcare providers andor pharmaceutical wholesale distributors depending on the distribution practice in each country Our product sales to three large wholesalers AmerisourceBergen Corporation McKesson Corporation and Cardinal Health Inc each individually accounted for more than 10 of total revenues for each of the years 2020 2019 and 2018 On a combined basis these wholesalers accounted for 83 81 and 84 of worldwide gross revenues for 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively We monitor the financial condition of our larger

to patent term extension in the United States Competition We operate in a highly competitive environment A number of our marketed products are indicated for disease areas in which other products or treatments are currently available or are being pursued by our competitors through research and development RD activities Additionally some competitormarketed products target the same genetic pathways as our recently launched marketed products or are currently in development This competition could impact the pricing and market share of our products We continue to pursue ways of increasing the value of our medicines through innovations during their life cycles which can include expanding the disease areas for which our products are indicated and finding new methods to make the delivery of our medicines easier and less costly Such activities can offer important opportunities for differentiation For example we market the Neulasta  Onpro  kit which provides physicians the opportunity to initiate the administration of the recommended dose of Neulasta  on the same day as chemotherapy with drug delivery at home the day after chemotherapy thereby saving patients a trip back to the doctor We plan to continue pursuing innovation efforts to strengthen our competitive position Such position may be based on among other things safety efficacy reliability availability patient convenience delivery devices price reimbursement access to and timing of market entry and patent position and expiration Certain of the existing patents on our principal products have expired and we face new and increasing competition including from biosimilars and generics A biosimilar is another version of a biological product for which marketing approval is sought or has been obtained based on a demonstration that it is highly similar to the original reference product We expect that the adverse impact on our originatorproduct sales from biosimilar competition will reflect current trends and actual results given similar conditions We also believe that when multiple biosimilar versions of one of our originator products get approved and launched competition could intensify more rapidly leading to net price declines for both reference and biosimilar products resulting in a greater impact on our products sales In the United States companies have now launched biosimilar versions of EPOGEN   NEUPOGEN  and Neulasta  and have approved biosimilars for ENBREL See also Government RegulationRegulation in the United StatesApproval of Biosimilars Although we expect competitor biosimilars to compete on price we believe many patients providers and payers will continue to place high value on the reputation reliability and safety of our products As additional biosimilar competitors come to market we will leverage our global experience versus both branded and biosimilar competition We also have our own biosimilar products both in the United States and outside of US markets that are competing against branded and biosimilar versions of our competitors products In 2019 Amgen launched MVASI   a biosimilar to Avastin  bevacizumab and KANJINTI   a biosimilar to Herceptin  trastuzumab in the United States and AMGEVITA TM  a biosimilar to Humira  adalimumab in Europe We have also received FDA approval for AMJEVITA TM adalimumabatto a biosimilar to Humira   In 2020 we launched AVSOLA   a biosimilar to Remicade  infliximab and in January 2021 we launched RIABNI TM  a biosimilar for Rituxan  rituximab We expect additional biosimilar competition against both our branded and biosimilar products in the future across all markets 8 In addition although most of our products are biologics some are small molecule products Because the FDA approval process permits generic manufacturers to rely on the safety and efficacy data of the innovator product rather than having to conduct their own costly and timeconsuming clinical trials generic manufacturers can often develop and market their competing versions of our small molecule products at much lower prices For example following loss of exclusivity of patents directed to cinacalcet the active ingredient in our small molecule calcimimetic Sensipar   we lost a significant share of the market and corresponding revenues in a very short period of time See Part IVNote 19 Contingencies and commitments to the Consolidated Financial Statements The introduction of new products the development of new processes or technologies by competitors or the emergence of new information about existing products may result i in increased competition for our marketed products even for those protected by patents andor ii in reductions in the prices we receive from selling our products In addition the development of new treatment options or standards of care may reduce the use of our products or may limit the utility and application of ongoing clinical trials for our product candidates As used in this document the term clinical trials may include prospective clinical trials observational studies registries and other studies See Item 1A Risk Factors Our products face substantial competition and Item 1A Risk Factors We currently face competition from biosimilars and expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars and generics in the future  9 The following table reflects our significant competitors

Pharmaceutical Company Limited 7 A subsidiary of BMS Reimbursement Sales of our principal products are dependent on the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement from thirdparty payers In many markets around the world these payers including government health systems private health insurers and other organizations remain focused on reducing the cost of healthcare and their efforts have intensified as a result of rising healthcare costs economic pressures and broader challenges generated by the COVID19 pandemic Drugs remain heavily scrutinized for cost containment As a result payers are becoming more restrictive regarding the use of biopharmaceutical products and are scrutinizing the prices of these products while requiring a higher level of clinical evidence to support the benefits such products bring to patients and the broader healthcare system These pressures are intensified when our products are subject to competition including from biosimilars 10 In the United States healthcare providers and other entities such as pharmacies and pharmacy benefit managers PBMs are reimbursed for covered services and products they deliver through both privatepayer and government healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid We provide negotiated rebates to healthcare providers private payers government payers and PBMs In addition we are required to i provide rebates or discounts on our products that are reimbursed through certain government programs including Medicare and Medicaid and ii provide discounts to qualifying healthcare providers under the federal 340B Drug Pricing Program Both private and government payers use formularies to manage access and utilization of drugs A drugs inclusion and favorable positioning on a formulary are essential to ensure patients have access to a particular drug Even when access is available some patients abandon their prescriptions for economic reasons Payers continue to institute cost reduction and containment measures that lower drug utilization andor spending altogether andor shift a greater portion of the costs to patients Such measures include but are not limited to morelimited benefit plan designs higher patient copays or coinsurance obligations limitations on patients use of commercial manufacturer copay payment assistance programs including through copay accumulator adjustment or maximization programs stricter utilization management criteria before a patient may get access to a drug highertier formulary placement that increases the level of patient outofpocket costs and formulary exclusion which effectively encourages patients and providers to seek alternative treatments or pay 100 of the cost of a drug The use of such measures by PBMs and insurers has continued to intensify and has thereby limited Amgen product usage and sales Furthermore during the past few years many PBMs and insurers have consolidated resulting in a smaller number of PBMs and insurers overseeing a large portion of total covered lives in the United States As a result PBMs and insurers have greater market power and negotiating leverage to mandate stricter utilization criteria andor exclude drugs from their formularies in favor of competitor drugs or alternative treatments In highly competitive treatment markets such as the markets for ENBREL Otezla   Repatha  and Aimovig   PBMs are also able to exert negotiating leverage by requiring incremental rebates from manufacturers in order for them to gain andor maintain their formulary position In addition to market actions taken by private and government payers in the United States policy makers from both of the major US political parties are pursuing policies to lower drug costs Potential policies cover a wide range of areas including allowing the importation of drugs from other countries instituting international reference pricing IRP schemes which would set the prices of certain drugs based on those available in other countries establishing caps on price increases based on inflation metrics increasing transparency on drug pricing and using thirdparty value assessments to determine drug prices Examples of such policies include the previous Administrations November 2020 interim final rule which attempts to institute most favored nation MFN IRP in Medicare Part B and final rule instituting rebate reform in Medicare Part D Both of these rules are being challenged in court and therefore have not yet been implemented The direction of drug pricing policy reforms remains unclear at this time In many countries outside the United States governmentsponsored healthcare systems are the primary payers for drugs and biologics With increasing budgetary constraints andor difficulty in understanding the value of medicines governments and payers in many countries are applying a variety of measures to exert downward price pressure These measures can include mandatory price controls price referencing therapeuticreference pricing increases in mandates incentives for generic substitution and biosimilar usage and governmentmandated price cuts In this regard many countries have health technology assessment organizations that use formal economic metrics such as costeffectiveness to determine prices coverage and reimbursement of new therapies and these organizations are expanding in both established and emerging markets Many countries also limit coverage to populations narrower than those specified on our product labels or impose volume caps to limit utilization We expect that countries will continue taking aggressive actions to seek to reduce expenditures on drugs and biologics Similarly fiscal constraints may also affect the extent to which countries are willing to approve new and innovative therapies andor allow access to new technologies 11 The dynamics and developments discussed above serve to create pressure on the pricing and potential usage of our products and the industry Given the diverse interests in play between payers biopharmaceutical manufacturers policy makers healthcare providers and independent organizations if and whether the parties involved can achieve alignment on the matters discussed above remain unclear and the outcome of any such alignment is difficult to predict We remain focused on pricing our products responsibly and delivering breakthrough treatments for unmet medical needs Amgen is committed to working with the entire healthcare community to ensure continued innovation and to facilitate patient access to needed medicines We do this by  investing billions of dollars annually in RD  developing more affordable therapeutic choices in the form of highquality and reliably supplied biosimilars  pricing our medicines to reflect the value they provide  partnering with payers to share risk and accountability for health outcomes  providing patient support and education programs  helping patients in financial need access our medicines and  working with policy makers patients and other stakeholders to establish a sustainable healthcare system with access to affordable care and where patients and their healthcare professionals are the primary decision makers See Item 1A Risk Factors Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from government and commercial thirdparty payers and pricing and reimbursement pressures may affect our profitability and Item 1A Risk Factors Guidelines and recommendations published by various organizations can reduce the use of our products Manufacturing Distribution and Raw Materials Manufacturing We believe we are a leader in the manufacture of biologics and that our manufacturing capabilities represent a competitive advantage The products we manufacture consist of both biologics and small molecule drugs The majority of our products are biologics that are produced in living cells and that are inherently complex due to naturally occurring molecular variations Highly specialized knowledge and extensive process and product characterization are required to transform laboratoryscale processes into reproducible commercial manufacturing processes Further our expertise in the manufacture of biologics positions us well for leadership in the global biosimilars market For additional information regarding manufacturing facilities see Item 2 Properties Our internal manufacturing network has commercial production capabilities for bulk manufacturing formulation fill finish tableting and device assembly These activities are performed within the United States and its territories in our Puerto Rico Rhode Island and California facilities as well as internationally in our Ireland Netherlands and Singapore facilities In addition we use thirdparty contract manufacturers to supplement the capacity or capability of our commercial manufacturing network To support our clinical trials we manufacture product candidates primarily at our California facilities We also use thirdparty contract manufacturers to supplement the capacity or capability of our overall clinical manufacturing network See Item 1A Risk Factors for a discussion of the factors that could adversely impact our manufacturing operations and the global supply of our products Distribution We operate distribution centers in Puerto Rico Kentucky California and the Netherlands for worldwide distribution of the majority of our commercial and clinical products We also use thirdparty distributors to supplement distribution of our products worldwide Other In addition to the manufacturing and distribution activities noted above each of our manufacturing locations includes key manufacturing support functions such as quality control process development engineering procurement production scheduling and warehousing Certain of those manufacturing and distribution activities are highly regulated by the FDA as well as international regulatory agencies See Government RegulationRegulation in the United StatesRegulation of Manufacturing Standards 12 Manufacturing Initiatives We have multiple ongoing initiatives that are designed to extend our manufacturing advantage by optimizing our manufacturing network andor by mitigating risks while continuing to ensure adequate supply of our products For example our licensed nextgeneration biomanufacturing plant operating in Singapore incorporates multiple innovative technologies into a single facility and was built in half the construction time and at approximately half the operating cost of a traditional plant Nextgeneration biomanufacturing plants require smaller manufacturing footprints and offer greater environmental benefits including reduced consumption of water and energy and lower levels of carbon emissions Within such plants the equipment is portable and smaller and some components are disposable which provides greater flexibility and speed when manufacturing different medicines simultaneously This eliminates the otherwise costly and complex retrofitting inherent in standard plants and enables Amgen to respond to changing demands for its medicines with increased agility ultimately increasing the speed at which a medicine can become available for patients The Singapore site also has a plant that has been approved to produce small molecule drugs for commercial manufacturing In July 2018 we broke ground for our newest nextgeneration biomanufacturing plant at our West Greenwich Rhode Island campus Construction on this new plant the first of its kind in the United States is complete Upon approval by the FDA and global regulatory authorities this plant will expand our capacity to manufacture certain products for US and global markets In 2019 we initiated projects to expand our manufacturing capabilities in Thousand Oaks California as well as at contract manufacturers These investments will initially support clinical manufacturing but in the future may also be leveraged for commercial manufacturing In September 2020 we entered into an arrangement with Lilly to manufacture Lillys potential COVID19 therapies For 2021and potentially through 2022we expect to allocate a portion of our manufacturing capacity to support this production Additionally starting in 2021 we will initiate projects that will expand our manufacturing capacity to enable supply of products and product candidates These projects will employ new technologies that are being developed by Amgen that are anticipated to allow further optimization of our manufacturing network and processes See Item 1A Risk Factors Manufacturing difficulties disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales Raw Materials and Medical Devices Certain raw materials medical devices including companion diagnostics and components necessary for the commercial andor clinical manufacturing of our products are provided by and are the proprietary products of unaffiliated thirdparty suppliers certain of which may be our only sources for such materials We currently attempt to manage the risk associated with such suppliers by means of inventory management relationship management and evaluation of alternative sources when feasible We also monitor the financial condition of certain suppliers and their ability to supply our needs See Item 1A Risk Factors We rely on thirdparty suppliers for certain of our raw materials medical devices and components We perform various procedures to help authenticate the sources of raw materials including intermediary materials used in the manufacture of our products which include verification of the country of origin The procedures are incorporated into the manufacturing processes we and our thirdparty contract manufacturers perform To better ensure supply Amgen has a risk mitigation strategy that uses a combination of methods including multiple sources or backup inventory of critical raw materials In response to COVID19 we continue to closely monitor our inventory levels and have taken additional measures to mitigate against raw material supply interruption as part of our ongoing business continuity efforts See Item 1A Risk Factors for a discussion of the factors that could adversely impact our manufacturing operations and the global supply of our products Government Regulation Regulation by government authorities in the United States and other countries is a significant factor in the production and marketing of our products and our ongoing RD activities To clinically test manufacture and market products for therapeutic use we must satisfy mandatory procedures and safety and effectiveness standards established by various regulatory bodies Compliance with these standards is complex and failure to comply with any of these standards can result in significant implications See Item 1A Risk Factors for a discussion of factors including global regulatory implications that can adversely impact our development and marketing of commercial products 13 Regulation in the United States In the United States the Public Health Service Act the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act FDCA and the regulations promulgated thereunder as well as other federal and state statutes and regulations govern among other things the production research development testing manufacture quality control labeling storage record keeping approval advertising promotion and distribution of our products in addition to the reporting of certain payments and other transfers of value to healthcare professionals and teaching hospitals Clinical Development and Product Approval Drug development in our industry is complex challenging and risky and failure rates are high Product development cycles are typically very longapproximately 10 to 15 years from discovery to market A potential new medicine must undergo many years of preclinical and clinical testing to establish its safety and efficacy for use in humans at appropriate dosing levels and with an acceptable riskbenefit profile We continue to work toward reducing cycle times by applying our expertise in human genetics and innovation in technology clinical trials and realworld evidence After laboratory analysis and preclinical testing in animals we file an Investigational New Drug Application IND with the FDA to begin human testing Typically we undertake an FDAdesignated threephase human clinical testing program  In phase 1 we conduct small clinical trials to investigate the safety and proper dose ranges of our product candidates in a small number of human subjects  In phase 2 we conduct clinical trials to investigate sideeffect profiles and the efficacy of our product candidates in a patient population larger than phase 1 but still relatively small who have the disease or condition under study  In phase 3 we conduct clinical trials to investigate the short and longterm safety and efficacy of our product candidates compared to commonly used treatments in a large number of patients who have the disease or condition under study The FDA monitors the progress of each trial conducted under an IND and may at its discretion reevaluate alter suspend or terminate the testing based on the data accumulated to that point and the FDAs riskbenefit assessment with regard to the patients enrolled in the trial The results of preclinical and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA in the form of either a Biologics License Application for biologic products or a NDA for small molecule products We are not permitted to market or promote a new product until the FDA has approved our marketing application Approval of Biosimilars  The Affordable Care Act ACA authorized the FDA to approve biosimilars via a separate abbreviated pathway The pathway allows sponsors of a biosimilar to seek and obtain regulatory approval based in part on the nonclinicaltrial and clinicaltrial data of an originator product to which the biosimilar has been demonstrated to be highly similar and to have no clinically meaningful differences in terms of safety purity and potency The relevance of demonstrating similarity is that in many cases biosimilars can be brought to market without conducting the full suite of clinical trials typically required of originators because riskbenefit has previously been established To preserve incentives for future innovation the law establishes a period of exclusivity for originators products which in general prohibits biosimilars from gaining FDA approval based in part on reliance on or reference to the originators data in their application to the FDA for 12 years after initial FDA approval of the originator product The law does not change the duration of patents granted on biologic products As part of the implementation of the abbreviated approval pathway for biosimilars the FDA released a number of guidance documents some of which remain in draft form Regulation of Product Marketing and Promotion  The FDA regulates the marketing and promotion of drug products Our product promotions for approved product indications must comply with the statutory standards of the FDCA and the FDAs implemented regulations and guidance The FDAs review of marketing and promotional activities encompasses but is not limited to directtoconsumer advertising healthcareproviderdirected advertising and promotion sales representative communications to healthcare professionals promotional programming and promotional activities involving electronic media The FDA may also review industrysponsored scientific and educational activities that make representations regarding product safety or efficacy in a promotional context The FDA may take enforcement action against a company for promoting unapproved uses of a product or for other violations of the FDAs advertising and labeling laws and regulations Enforcement action may include product seizures injunctions civil or criminal penalties or regulatory letters which may require corrective advertising or other corrective communications to healthcare professionals Failure to comply with the FDAs regulations also can result in adverse publicity or increased scrutiny of company activities by the US Congress or other legislators Additionally as described below such failure may lead to additional liability under US healthcare fraud and abuse laws 14 Regulation of Manufacturing Standards  The FDA regulates and inspects the equipment facilities laboratories and processes used in the manufacturing and testing of products prior to granting approval to market products If after receiving approval from the FDA we make a material change in manufacturing equipment location or process additional regulatory review may be required We also must adhere to current Good Manufacturing Practice regulations and productspecific regulations enforced by the FDA through its facilities inspection program The FDA conducts regular periodic visits to reinspect our equipment facilities laboratories and processes following an initial approval Regulation of Combination Products  Combination products are defined by the FDA as products composed of two or more regulated components eg a biologic andor drug and a device Biologicsdrugs and devices each have their own regulatory requirements and combination products may have additional requirements A number of our marketed products meet this definition and are regulated under this framework and we expect that a number of our pipeline product candidates will be evaluated for regulatory approval under this framework as well Regulation outside the United States In European Union EU countries as well as in Switzerland Canada Australia and Japan regulatory requirements and approval processes are similar in principle to those in the United States In the EU there are currently two potential tracks for seeking marketing approval for a product not authorized in any EU member state a decentralized procedure and a centralized procedure In the decentralized procedure  identical applications for marketing authorization are submitted simultaneously to the national regulatory agencies Regulatory review is led by one member state the referencemember state and its assessmentbased on safety quality and efficacyis reviewed and approved assuming there are no concerns that the product poses a serious risk to public health by the other member states from which the applicant is seeking approval the concernedmember states The decentralized procedure leads to a series of single national approvals in all relevant countries In the centralized procedure  which is required of all products derived from biotechnology a company submits a single MAA to the EMA which conducts an evaluation of the dossier drawing upon its scientific resources across Europe If the drug product is proven to fulfill requirements for quality safety and efficacy the EMAs Committee for Medicinal Products of Human Use CHMP adopts a positive opinion which is transmitted to the European Commission EC for final decision on granting of the marketing authorization Even though the EC generally follows the CHMPs opinion it is not bound to do so Subsequent commercialization is enabled by countrybycountry reimbursement approval In the EU biosimilars are approved under a specialized pathway of the centralized procedure As with the US pathway an applicant seeks and obtains regulatory approval for a biosimilar once the data exclusivity period for the original reference product has expired relying in part on the data submitted for the originator product together with data evidencing that the biosimilar is highly similar in terms of quality safety and efficacy to the original reference product authorized in the European Economic Area As a result of the United Kingdoms decision to leave the EU the EMA in March 2019 relocated to Amsterdam The United Kingdom officially left the EU in January 2020 and in December 2020 a new trade deal was agreed that starts to clarify how UK medicines will be independently supervised and where continued collaborations and recognitions can be expected Amgen continues to monitor future negotiations to ensure no interruption in the supervision regulation or supply of medicines in the United Kingdom and Europe Other countries such as Russia Turkey and those in Latin America and the Middle East have review processes and data requirements similar to those of the EU and in some cases can rely on prior marketing approval from US or EU regulatory authorities The regulatory process in these countries may include manufacturingtesting facility inspections testing of drug product upon importation and other domestic requirements In Asia Pacific a number of countries such as China Japan South Korea and Taiwan may require local clinicaltrial data for bridging purposes as part of the drug registration process in addition to global clinical trials which can add to overall drug development and registration timelines In most of the Asian markets registration timelines depend on marketing approval in the United States or the EU In some markets in Asia such as China Indonesia and Thailand the regulatory timelines can be less predictable The regulatory process may also include manufacturingtesting facility inspections testing of drug product upon importation and other domestic requirements Countries such as Australia and Japan have moremature systems that would allow for submissions under morecompetitive time frames Regarding biosimilars several of these countries have pathways to register biosimilars eg Australia India Singapore South Korea and Taiwan and biosimilar products are already present on the markets eg Australia and South Korea 15 In some countries such as Japan and those in the EU medical devices may be subject to regulatory regimes whereby manufacturers must establish that their medical devices conform to essential requirements set out in the law for the particular device category For example in the EU with limited exceptions medical devices placed on the market must bear the Conformit Europenne marking to indicate their conformity with legal requirements Postapproval Phase After approval we continue to monitor adverse events and product complaints reported following the use of our products through routine postmarketing surveillance and studies when applicable We report such events to the appropriate regulatory agencies as required by local regulations for individual cases and aggregate reports We proactively monitor according to good pharmacovigilance practices and ensure the implementation of signal detection assessment and the communication of adverse events that may be associated with the use of our products We also proactively monitor product complaints through our quality systems which includes assessing our drug delivery devices for device complaints adverse events and malfunctions We may also be required by regulatory agencies to conduct further clinical trials on our marketed products as a condition of their approval or to provide additional information on safety and efficacy Health regulators including the FDA have authority to mandate labeling changes to products at any point in a products life cycle based on new safety information or as part of an evolving label change to a particular class of products Health regulators including the FDA also have authority before or after approval to require a company to implement a risk management program for a product to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks Each risk management program is unique and varies depending on the specific factors required In the United States a risk management program is known as a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy REMS and we currently have REMSs for Prolia   Nplate  and BLINCYTO   Other Regulation We are also subject to various laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse including antikickback laws and falseclaims laws Antikickback laws make it illegal to solicit offer receive or pay any remuneration in exchange for or to induce the referral of business including the purchase or prescribing of a particular drug that is reimbursed by a state or federal program Falseclaims laws prohibit knowingly and willingly presenting or causing to be presented for payment to thirdparty payers including Medicare and Medicaid any claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent claims for items or services not provided as claimed or claims for medically unnecessary items or services Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal andor civil sanctions including fines and civil monetary penalties as well as by the possibility of exclusion from federal healthcare programs including Medicare and Medicaid Liability under the falseclaims laws may also arise when a violation of certain laws or regulations related to the underlying product eg violations regarding improper promotional activity or unlawful payments contributes to the submission of a false claim In 2012 Amgen entered into a corporate integrity agreement with the Office of Inspector General OIG of the US Department of Health  Human Services HHS which was formally closed out in August 2018 On April 25 2019 we entered into a settlement agreement with the US Department of Justice DOJ and the OIG of the HHS to settle certain allegations related to our support of independent charitable organizations that provide patients with financial assistance to access their medicines Additionally we entered into a corporate integrity agreement that requires us to maintain a corporate compliance program and to undertake a set of defined corporate integrity obligations for a period of five years Due to the breadth of the statutory provisions and the absence of guidance in the form of regulations or court decisions addressing some of our practices it is possible that in the future our practices might be further challenged under antikickback or similar laws The US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act FCPA prohibits US corporations and their representatives from offering promising authorizing or making payments to any foreign government official government staff member political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad The scope of the FCPA arguably includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries Other countries have enacted similar anticorruption laws andor regulations Failure by our employees agents contractors vendors licensees partners or collaborators to comply with the FCPA and other anticorruption laws andor regulations could result in significant civil or criminal penalties We are subject to various laws and regulations globally regarding privacy and data protection These laws and regulations involve the collection storage handling use disclosure transfer and security of personal data The legislative and regulatory environments regarding privacy and data protection are continually evolving and developing as these issues are the subjects of increasing amounts of attention in countries globally For example we are subject to the EUs General Data Protection Regulation GDPR which became effective on May 25 2018 and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 which became effective on January 1 2020 Other jurisdictions where we operate have enacted or proposed similar legislation andor regulations Failure to comply with these laws could result in significant penalties 16 Our business has been and will continue to be subject to various other US and foreign laws rules and regulations See Reimbursement section above Research and Development and Selected Product Candidates We focus our RD on novel human therapeutics for the treatment of serious illness We capitalize on our strengths in human genetics novel biology and protein engineering We leverage our biologic expertise and take a modalityindependent approach to RD And we use cuttingedge science and technology to study subtle biological mechanisms in search of therapies that will improve the lives of those who suffer from diseases Our discovery research programs may therefore yield targets that lead to the development of human therapeutics delivered as large molecules small molecules other combination modalities or new modalities We have reshaped our portfolio and have increasingly focused our efforts on human genetics when possible to enhance the likelihood of success In response to the COVID19 pandemic we managed our clinical development on a casebycase basis Patients who were already enrolled in studies continued to receive study drug including through directtopatient shipments For studies that had the potential for significant benefit in a serious or lifethreatening condition and when site resources enabled new patients to be enrolled safely and monitored closely we continued enrollment For clinical trials experiencing uncertainty with regard to the trial sites ability to ensure subject safety or data integrity at that time we temporarily paused enrollment We remain focused on supporting our active clinical sites in providing care for these patients and providing investigational drug supply To date the majority of clinical trials that were paused at the onset of the pandemic to ensure subject safety or data integrity have resumed Study enrollments were affected the most in the second quarter of 2020 and by the end of the year resumed to prepandemic levels although COVID19 infection rates and related vaccination activities may impact future patient enrollment We continuously monitor and reevaluate the status of studies pausing when uncertainty arises with regard to the trial sites ability to ensure safety or data integrity We remain focused on supporting our active clinical sites in providing care for these patients and in providing investigational drug supply In addition our RD organization is supporting efforts to combat the COVID19 pandemic in a number of ways including by i working to support production of therapeutic antibodies that could diminish the impact of COVID19 on patients ii joining a publicprivate partnership between leading companies in our industry and US government health agencies to develop a strategy for a coordinated research response and iii participating in platform studies to investigate treatments in adult patients hospitalized with severe COVID19 infections For the years ended December 31 2020 2019 and 2018 our RD expenses were 42 billion 41 billion and 37 billion respectively We have major RD centers in Thousand Oaks and San Francisco California Iceland and the United Kingdom as well as smaller research centers and development facilities globally See Item 2 Properties Our clinical trial activities are conducted by both our internal staff and thirdparty contract clinical trial service providers To increase the number of patients available for enrollment in our clinical trials we have opened clinical sites and will continue opening clinical sites and enrolling patients in a number of geographic locations See Government RegulationRegulation in the United StatesClinical Development and Product Approval for a discussion of government regulation over clinical development Also see Item 1A Risk Factors We must conduct clinical trials in humans before we commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications Some of our competitors are actively engaged in RD in areas in which we have products or in which we are developing product candidates or new indications for existing products For example we compete with other clinical trials for eligible patients which may limit the number of available patients who meet the criteria for certain clinical trials The competitive marketplace for our product candidates is greatly dependent on the timing of entry into the market Early entry may have important advantages in gaining product acceptance thereby contributing to a products eventual success and profitability Accordingly we expect that in some cases the relative speed with which we can develop products complete clinical testing receive regulatory approval and supply commercial quantities of a product to the market will be important to our competitive position In addition to product candidates and marketed products generated from our internal RD efforts we acquire companies acquire and license certain product and RD technology rights and establish RD arrangements with third parties to enhance our strategic position within our industry by strengthening and diversifying our RD capabilities product pipeline and marketed product base In pursuing these RD arrangements and licensing or acquisition activities we face competition from other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that also seek to license or acquire technologies product candidates or marketed products from those entities performing the RD 17 The following table shows a selection of certain of our

in the low 30s The rights to develop and market Nexavar  in Japan are reserved to Bayer In the United States Bayer pays us a royalty on sales of Nexavar  at a percentage rate in the high 30s 23 DaVita Inc In January 2017 we entered into a sixyear supply agreement with DaVita Inc DaVita which superseded the previously existing sevenyear supply agreement that commenced in 2012 Pursuant to the 2017 agreement we supply EPOGEN  and Aranesp  in amounts necessary to meet specified annual percentages of DaVitas and its affiliates requirements for erythropoiesisstimulating agents ESAs used in providing dialysis services in the United States and Puerto Rico Such percentages vary during the term of the agreement but in each year are at least 90 The agreement expires in 2022 The agreement may be terminated by either party before expiration of its term in the event of certain breaches of the agreement by the other party For financial information concerning our significant collaborative arrangements see Part IVNote 8 Collaborations to the Consolidated Financial Statements Human Capital Resources Amgens approach to human capital resource management starts with our mission to serve patients Our industry exists in a complex regulatory and reimbursement environment The unique demands of our industry together with the challenges of running an enterprise focused on the discovery development manufacture and commercialization of innovative medicines require talent that is highly educated andor has significant industry experience Additionally for certain key functions we require specific scientific expertise to oversee and conduct RD activities and the complex manufacturing requirements for biopharmaceutical products As of December 31 2020 Amgen had approximately 24300 staff members and we have had relatively low global turnover rates We consider our staff relations to be good supported by our regular staff engagement assessments with surveys on a wide range of topics including engagement in the COVID19 environment diversity inclusion and belonging and ethics We discuss the results of these surveys with our Board of Directors Compensation Benefits and Development Our approach to employee compensation and benefits is designed to deliver cash equity and benefit programs that are competitive with those offered by leading companies in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries to attract motivate and retain talent with a focus on encouraging performance promoting accountability and adherence to Company values and alignment with the interests of the Companys shareholders Our base pay program aims to compensate staff members relative to the value of the contributions of their role which takes into account the skills knowledge and abilities required to perform each position as well as the experience brought to the job We also provide annual incentive programs to reward our staff in alignment with achievement of Companywide goals that are established annually and designed to drive aspects of our strategic priorities that support and advance our strategy across our Company The majority of our staff members are also eligible for the grant of equity awards under our longterm incentive program that are designed to align the experience of these staff with that of our shareholders All staff also participate in a regular performance measurement process that aligns pay to performance and through which staff receive performance and development feedback To support the development of our staff we provide a variety of programs including leadership development programs virtual instructorled courses and selfpaced learning options Our benefit programs are also generally broadbased promote health and overall wellbeing and

and healthy workplace for our staff is a priority at Amgen Our goal is to have a world class safety record through safety leadership risk management practices and integrating safety throughout our business processes To foster our safety culture we implement a comprehensive safety program driving to understand and mitigate the root cause of safety incidents and manage and control variability We use leading indicators to assess the effectiveness of our safety programs and make course corrections as needed Additionally we perform formal executive management review of functional safety performance for Operations Global Commercial Operations and RD on a quarterly basis with a focus on identifying early signals and taking action to drive continuous improvement Based on our 2019 performance compared to a benchmark of twelve companies in the pharmaceutical industry Amgen was in the quartile with the lowest injury rate In response to the COVID19 pandemic and as part of our commitment to work to ensure the safety and wellbeing of our employees we have activated our applicable business continuity plans including having those of our employees who are able to work from home to do so since midMarch 2020 For employees returning to the workplace and the field we have also taken additional safety measures including implementing occupancy limits restricting business travel providing and requiring the use of personal protective equipment temperature screening and COVID19 testing to access our workplaces Our Corporate Responsibility and Compliance Committee provides general oversight of our safety programs and initiatives while our Board of Directors as a whole has overseen our specific responses to the COVID19 pandemic Diversity Inclusion and Belonging We believe that a diverse and inclusive culture fosters innovation which supports our ability to serve patients Further we also believe our global presence is strengthened by having a workforce that reflects the diversity of the patients we serve It is with these beliefs in mind that we have continued to strengthen and grow our culture of diversity inclusion and belonging Our internal efforts include in 2019 establishing a Diversity Inclusion and Belonging Council chaired by our Chief Executive Officer In 2020 we implemented a global unconscious bias training program and launched a portal devoted to diversity inclusion and belonging that includes learning and resources Further we are leveraging our Employee Resource Groups listed below to represent and support the diversity of Amgen staff Employee Resource Groups Amgen Asian Association AAA Amgen Black Employee Network ABEN Ability Bettered through Leadership and Education ABLE a resource group for the physically or cognitively disabled Amgen Early Career Professionals AECP Amgen Indian Subcontinent Network AISN Amgen Latin Employee Network ALEN Amgen LGBTQ and Allies Network PRIDE Amgen Veterans Employees Network AVEN Women Empowered to be Exceptional WE2 Women in Information Systems Enrichment WISE In areas of underrepresentation we develop plans with a goal of bringing our representation in line with availability and we also engage in outreach efforts to attract retain and advance more women and minorities in our workforce For example we have worked to enhance our diverse candidate recruiting pool by developing relationships with organizations that can serve as a source of diverse candidates such as the National Black MBA Association and National Sales Network as well as historically black colleges and universities Additionally at the end of 2020 we became a founding member of OneTen a coalition of 35 of the worlds largest bestknown companies that aims to hire one million Black Americans with a specific focus on those without fouryear college degrees into goodpaying familysustaining jobs over the next ten years Other examples of actions that we are taking in this area include investment and participation in Healthcare Businesswomens Association a global organization focused on development and business networking for women in healthcare and the University of California Los Angeles UCLA Anderson School of Management womens leadership program 25 In an effort to provide additional transparency into the makeup of our workforce we intend to disclose our 2020 Consolidated EEO1 Report

report and other documents we file with the SEC contain forwardlooking statements that are based on current expectations estimates forecasts and projections about us our future performance our business our beliefs and our managements assumptions These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties our business faces The risks described below are not the only ones we face Our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies such as employment relations general economic conditions geopolitical events and international operations Further additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may in the future materially and adversely affect our business operations liquidity and stock price SUMMARY Risks Related to Economic Conditions and Operating a Global Business Including During the COVID19 Pandemic  The COVID19 pandemic and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of the disease have had and are expected to continue to have an adverse effect and may have a material adverse effect on our clinical trials operations supply chains distribution systems product development product sales business and results of operations  A breakdown cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality integrity and availability of our information technology systems networkconnected control systems andor our data interrupt the operation of our business andor affect our reputation  Our sales and operations are subject to the risks of doing business internationally including in emerging markets 27 Risks Related to Government Regulations and ThirdParty Policies  Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from government and commercial thirdparty payers and pricing and reimbursement pressures have affected and are likely to continue to affect our profitability  Guidelines and recommendations published by various organizations can reduce the use of our products  The adoption and interpretation of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability  Our business may be affected by litigation and government investigations Risks Related to Competition  Our products face substantial competition and our product candidates are also likely to face substantial competition  Our intellectual property positions may be challenged invalidated or circumvented or we may fail to prevail in current and future intellectual property litigation  We currently face competition from biosimilars and generics and expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars and generics in the future  Concentration of sales at certain of our wholesaler distributors and at one freestanding dialysis clinic business and consolidation of private payers may negatively affect our business Risks Related to Research and Development  We may not be able to develop commercial products despite significant investments in RD  We must conduct clinical trials in humans before we commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications  Our current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval  Some of our products are used with drug delivery or companion diagnostic devices that have their own regulatory manufacturing and other risks  Some of our pharmaceutical pipeline and our commercial product sales rely on collaborations with third parties which may adversely affect the development and sale of our products  Our efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies products or technology and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology we have acquired may not be successful and may result in unanticipated costs delays or failures to realize the benefits of the transactions Risks Related to Operations  We perform a substantial majority of our commercial manufacturing activities at our facility in the US territory of Puerto Rico and a substantial majority of our clinical manufacturing activities at our facility in Thousand Oaks California significant disruptions or production failures at these facilities could significantly impair our ability to supply our products or continue our clinical trials  We rely on thirdparty suppliers for certain of our raw materials medical devices and components  Manufacturing difficulties disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales General Risk Factors  Global economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business  Our stock price is volatile  We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us or at all 28 RISKS RELATED TO ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND OPERATING A GLOBAL BUSINESS INCLUDING DURING THE COVID19 PANDEMIC The COVID19 pandemic and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of the disease have had and are expected to continue to have an adverse effect and may have a material adverse effect on our clinical trials operations supply chains distribution systems product development product sales business and results of operations The novel coronavirus identified in late 2019 SARSCoV2 which causes the disease known as COVID19 is an ongoing global pandemic that has resulted in public and governmental efforts to contain or slow the spread of the disease including widespread shelterinplace orders social distancing interventions quarantines travel restrictions and various forms of operational shutdowns The COVID19 pandemic and the resulting measures implemented in response to the pandemic are adversely affecting and is expected to continue to adversely affect our business including our RD clinical trials operations supply chains distribution systems product development and sales activities the business activities of our suppliers customers thirdparty payers and our patients See Our current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval  and see also We must conduct clinical trials in humans before we commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications  Due to the pandemic and these measures and their effects we have experienced and expect to continue to experience unpredictable reductions in demand for certain of our products and in some cases have experienced and could continue to experience unpredictable increases in demand for certain of our products Our clinical trials have been and are expected to continue to be adversely affected by the COVID19 pandemic We have clinical work ongoing at investigational sites across the globe A number of clinical trial sites including those in regions experiencing new or resurgent outbreaks of COVID19 have restricted site visits and imposed restrictions on the initiation of new clinical trials andor patient visits to protect both site staff and patients from possible COVID19 exposure that has stopped or slowed clinical trial activities In response to the safety concerns related to COVID19 we have suspended and will continue to suspend enrollment and screening in clinical trials where sites are unable to perform clinical trial work due to COVID19 or there is uncertainty around the ability of sites to ensure subject safety or data integrity Further the COVID19 pandemic has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our ability to enroll or to continue to enroll certain required postmarketing studies including pediatric studies While many of our clinical trial activities have recommenced over the course of 2020 the initial disruption caused by the COVID19 pandemic to our clinical trials and our clinical trial plans and timelines and any similar future disruptions including as a result of the current surge and lockdowns in numerous regions may have a significant adverse effect on our product development and launches and in turn on future product sales business and results of operations For example to ensure patient safety we initially paused enrollment of our sotorasib Phase 1 combination cohort with Keytruda  and Phase 3 lung cancer study and such interruptions in enrollment may ultimately affect the timeline of these or other studies Additionally while we are investing in research collaborations and operational support to potentially develop andor produce treatments for COVID19 such activities may not result in therapeutic candidates product approvals successful production andor significant commercial value being derived from potential COVID19related medicines As a result of the COVID19 pandemic we have experienced and expect to continue to experience regulatory delays including delays in receiving regulatory advice reviews of applications or performance of inspections required for approvals The pandemic may also result in greater regulatory uncertainty For example the FDA and the EMA have issued guidance to provide biopharmaceutical manufacturers greater flexibility in certain regulatory areas including protocol deviations and adverse event reporting However such flexibility may result in greater uncertainty regarding the expectations of such health authorities in relation to this guidance Additionally there may be delays in ongoing or new patent office or patent proceedings in the United States or internationally that may delay the outcome of such proceedings Such delays and disruptions could have a significant adverse effect on our product development and launches product sales business and results of operations 29 In response to COVID19 we have activated our applicable business continuity plans including suspending US inperson meetings and interactions with the healthcare community and professionals in a substantial number of states suspending as a general matter all international business travel and the majority of domestic travel within the United States and US employees who are able to work from home have been doing so since midMarch 2020 Our ability to perform critical functions and maintain operations have been adversely affected and could continue to be adversely affected as a result of such workforce restrictions and the COVID19related support programs we have put into place for our staff suppliers and customers have increased and are expected to continue to increase our operating expenses and reduce the efficiency of our operations Notwithstanding such support programs the COVID19 pandemics effects on the health and availability of our workforce as well as those of the third parties on which we rely could have an adverse effect on our business If members of our management and other key personnel in critical functions across our organization are unable to perform their duties or have limited availability due to COVID19 we may not be able to execute on our business strategy and our operations may be adversely affected Additionally disruptions in public and private infrastructure including transportation and supply chains have adversely affected and continue to adversely affect the efficiency of our business operations Also the transition of the majority of our workforce to a remote work environment in response to COVID19 as well as that of our thirdparty service providers have exacerbated certain risks to our business including but not limited to those associated with an increased demand for information technology resources increased risk of cybersecurity attacks including social engineering attacks and increased risk of unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information or our proprietary or confidential information As the pandemic continues to progress we have observed an increase in cybersecurity incidents predominantly ransomware and social engineering attacks experienced by our thirdparty service providers Further government entities have also been the subject of cyberattacks The EMA disclosed in December 2020 that it had been the subject of a cyberattack that targeted and accessed thirdparty documents relating to regulatory submissions and that such documents were published on the internet some of which were manipulated prior to publication Such thirdparty and governmental incidents have created the risk of the loss of availability andor control of information including information related to our clinical trials important to the operation of our business See A breakdown cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality integrity and availability of our information technology systems networkconnected control systems andor our data interrupt the operation of our business andor affect our reputation In the future as the pandemic progresses and afterwards we may experience significant adverse effects on our commercial and clinical manufacturing activities our operations and our cybersecurity and our suppliers and vendors may also experience significant disruptions to their activities and operations on which we depend as a result of these cybersecurity incidents Federal state and local and international governmental policies and initiatives designed to reduce the transmission of COVID19 also have resulted in the cancellation or delay of diagnostic elective specialty and other procedures and appointments to avoid nonessential patient exposure to medical environments and potential infection with COVID19 and to focus limited resources and personnel capacity toward the treatment of COVID19 These measures and challenges will likely continue to varying degrees for the duration of the pandemic and have significantly reduced patient access to and administration of certain of our drugs For example Prolia  is a product requiring administration by a healthcare provider in doctors offices or other healthcare settings that are affected by COVID19 The US label for Prolia  instructs healthcare professionals who discontinue Prolia  to transition the patient to an alternative antiresorptive including oral treatments that do not require administration by a healthcare provider Further as a result of COVID19 oncology patients in consultation with their doctors may be selecting less immunosuppressive therapies or therapies that do not require administration in a hospital setting potentially adversely affecting certain of our products Also new patients are less likely to be diagnosed andor to start therapeutics during the pandemic Once the pandemic subsides we anticipate there will be a substantial backlog of patients seeking appointments with physicians relating to a variety of medical conditions and as a result patients seeking treatment with certain of our products may have to navigate limited provider capacity and this limited provider capacity could have a continued adverse effect on our sales following the opening up of various geographies andor the end of the pandemic Further the effects of the COVID19 pandemic may result in longterm shifts in preferences among healthcare professionals and patients toward treatments that do not require administration by healthcare professionals or visits to medical facilities 30 The legislative and regulatory environment governing our businesses is dynamic and changing frequently in response to COVID19 For example the COVID19 pandemic has resulted in increased interest in compulsory licenses marchin rights or other governmental interventions both in the United States and internationally related to the procurement of drugs such as the WHOs COVID19 Technology Access Pool initiative which provides an approach for sharing all intellectual property information and clinical trial data necessary to enable generic drug manufacturing See Our intellectual property positions may be challenged invalidated or circumvented or we may fail to prevail in current and future intellectual property litigation  Further the challenges of the pandemic have resulted in the exploration of signification legislation to address the need to supply medicines to address COVID19 Pursuant to the declaration of a national emergency in the United States in March 2020 under the Stafford Act state and local governments may request access to discounted pricing for certain items related to the COVID19 response The Coronavirus Aid Relief and Economic Security CARES Act implements initiatives to provide advanced payments from Medicare to healthcare providers clinics and physicians and to require Medicare plans to provide up to a 90day supply of Part D drugs However despite such initiatives and government support there may be adverse effects on the timing and collectability of our customer receivables as a result of the COVID19 pandemic See Concentration of sales at certain of our wholesaler distributors and at one freestanding dialysis clinic business and consolidation of private payers may negatively affect our business The COVID19 pandemic has also resulted in a significant increase in unemployment and underemployment which may continue after the pandemic Such a significant increase in unemployment or other disruptions in the labor market have led to a substantial reduction in disposable income and in the US access to healthcare insurance including reductions in the commercially insured population that has led to growth and is expected to continue to lead to growth in Medicaid enrollment which has adversely affected our product sales See Global economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business  Such reduction in healthcare insurance could be compounded by any full or partial repeal of the ACA by the US Supreme Court Further globally the substantial pressures placed on governmental and payor budgets as a result of the COVID19 pandemic and the projected governmental budget shortfalls caused by significantly reduced economic activity during and potentially after the COVID19 pandemic together with the longterm impact from the pressures on healthcare systems may result in greater and continued downward price pressure on biopharmaceutical products and increased intensity of stakeholder negotiations across the biopharmaceutical value chain See Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from thirdparty payers and pricing and reimbursement pressures may affect our profitability As the pandemic continues and if conditions worsen or if the duration of the pandemic extends significantly we expect to experience additional adverse effects on our operational and commercial activities customer purchases and our collections of accounts receivable It is unclear which adverse effects may be material and it remains uncertain the degree to which these adverse effects would impact our future operational and commercial activities customer purchases and our collections even if conditions begin to improve There was a resurgence in COVID19 infections in numerous jurisdictions in the autumn of 2020 and winter of 20202021 resulting in the reinstatement of stricter restrictions and shutdowns in a number of jurisdictions It is expected that the pandemic will continue to ebb and flow with different jurisdictions having higher levels of infections than others over the course of the pandemic In addition to existing travel restrictions jurisdictions may continue or reinstate border closures impose or reimpose prolonged quarantines and further restrict travel and business activity which could significantly affect our ability to support our operations and customers and the ability of our employees to get to their workplaces to discover study develop and produce our product candidates and products disrupt the movement of our products through the supply chain and prevent or discourage patients from seeking healthcare services and the administration of certain of our products Further in connection with the global outbreak and spread of COVID19 and in an effort to increase the wider availability of needed medical products we or our suppliers may elect to or governments may require us or our suppliers to allocate manufacturing capacity for example pursuant to the US Defense Production Act in a way that adversely affects our regular operations customer relationships and financial results In the US on January 21 2021 President Biden issued an Executive Order instructing federal agencies to use all available legal authorities including the Defense Production Act to improve current and future pandemic response and biological threat preparedness The rapid reallocation of resources for the treatment and prevention of COVID19 including the production of COVID19 vaccinations or related therapies such as our agreement to contribute to the production of one of Lillys potential COVID19 antibody therapies could also result in increased competition for or reduced availability of materials used in the manufacturing or distribution of our products In addition unpredictable increases in demand for certain of our products could exceed our capacity to meet such demand which could adversely affect our financial results and customer relationships 31 The COVID19 pandemic and the volatile global economic conditions stemming from it may precipitate or amplify the other risks described in this Risk Factors section which could materially adversely affect our business operations and financial conditions and results For example if a natural disaster or other potentially disruptive event occurs concurrently with the COVID19 pandemic such disaster or event could deplete our inventory levels and we could experience a disruption to our manufacturing or ability to supply our products Further the global pandemic has exacerbated geopolitical tensions and some countries such as China may be especially vulnerable to such dynamics If relations between the United States and China or other governments deteriorates our business and investments in China or other such markets may also be adversely affected See Our sales and operations are subject to the risks of doing business internationally including in emerging markets The rapid development and fluidity of the pandemic preclude any prediction as to the ultimate effect of COVID19 on us The duration of the measures being taken by the authorities to mitigate against the spread of COVID19 including the distribution of vaccines and the extent to which such measures are effective if at all remain highly uncertain The magnitude and degree of COVID19s adverse effect on our business including our product development product sales operating results and resulting cash flows and financial condition will be driven by the severity and duration of the pandemic the pandemics effect on the United States and global economies and the timing scope and effectiveness of federal state local and international governmental responses to the pandemic If the spread continues at or near its current trajectory or mitigation continues to require similar levels of shelterinplace and shutdown orders any adverse effects of COVID19 will likely grow and could be enduring and our business and financial position could be materially adversely affected A breakdown cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality integrity and availability of our information technology systems networkconnected control systems andor our data interrupt the operation of our business andor affect our reputation To achieve our business objectives we rely on sophisticated information technology systems including software mobile applications cloud services and networkconnected control systems some of which are managed hosted provided or serviced by third parties Internal or external events that compromise the confidentiality integrity and availability of our systems and data may significantly interrupt the operation of our business result in significant costs andor adversely affect our reputation Our information technology systems are highly integrated into our business including our RD efforts our clinical and commercial manufacturing processes and our product sales and distribution processes Further as the majority of our employees are working remotely our reliance on our and thirdparty information technology systems has increased substantially and is expected to continue to increase The complexity and interconnected nature of our systems makes them potentially vulnerable to breakdown or other service interruptions Our systems are also subject to frequent cyberattacks As the cyberthreat landscape evolves these attacks are growing in frequency sophistication and intensity and are becoming increasingly difficult to detect Such attacks could include the use of harmful and virulent malware including ransomware or other denials of service that can be deployed through various means including the software supply chain email malicious websites andor the use of social engineering Attacks such as those experienced by governmental entities including those that approve andor regulate our products such as the EMA and other multinational companies including some of our peers could leave us unable to utilize key business systems or access or protect important data and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business including developing gaining regulatory approval for manufacturing selling andor distributing our products For example in 2017 a pharmaceutical company experienced a cyberattack involving virulent malware that significantly disrupted its operations including its research and sales operations and the production of some of its medicines and vaccines As a result of the cyberattack its orders and sales for certain products in certain markets were negatively affected In December 2020 SolarWinds Corporation a leading provider of software for monitoring and managing information technology infrastructure disclosed that it had suffered a cybersecurity incident whereby attackers had inserted malicious code into legitimate software updates for its products that were installed by myriad private and government customers enabling the attackers to access a backdoor to such systems See The COVID19 pandemic and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of the disease have had and are expected to continue to have an adverse effect and may have a material adverse effect on our clinical trials operations supply chains distribution systems product development product sales business and results of operations for a discussion of the cyberattack on the EMA Our systems also contain and utilize a high volume of sensitive data including intellectual property trade secrets financial information regulatory information strategic plans sales trends and forecasts litigation materials andor personal information belonging to us our staff our patients customers andor other parties In some cases we utilize thirdparty service providers to process store manage or transmit such data which may increase our risk Intentional or inadvertent data privacy or security breaches including cyberattacks or lapses by employees service providers including providers of information technologyspecific services nation states including groups associated with or supported by foreign intelligence agencies organized crime organizations hacktivists or others create risks that our sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons our competitors or the public 32 Domestic and global government regulators our business partners suppliers with whom we do business companies that provide us or our partners with business services and companies we may acquire may face similar risks and security breaches of their systems could adversely affect our security leave us without access to important systems products raw materials components services or information or expose our confidential data For example in 2019 two vendors that perform testing and analytical services that we use in developing and manufacturing our products have experienced cyberattacks and in April and September of 2020 vendors that provide us with information technology services and clinical data services respectively each experienced ransomware attacks Each of these incidents required us to disconnect our systems from those vendors systems While we were able to reconnect our systems following restoration of these vendors capabilities without significantly affecting product availability a more extended service outage affecting these or other vendors particularly where such vendor is the single source from which we obtain the services could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations In addition we distribute our products in the United States primarily through three pharmaceutical wholesalers and a security breach that impairs the distribution operations of our wholesalers could significantly impair our ability to deliver our products to healthcare providers and patients Although we have experienced system breakdowns attacks and information security breaches we do not believe such breakdowns attacks and breaches have had a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations We continue to invest in the monitoring protection and resilience of our critical andor sensitive data and systems However there can be no assurances that our efforts will detect prevent or fully recover systems or data from all breakdowns service interruptions attacks andor breaches of our systems that could adversely affect our business and operations andor result in the loss or exposure of critical proprietary private confidential or otherwise sensitive data which could result in material financial legal business or reputational harm to us or negatively affect our stock price While we maintain cyberliability insurance our insurance is not sufficient to cover us against all losses that could potentially result from a service interruption breach of our systems or loss of our critical or sensitive data We are also subject to various laws and regulations globally regarding privacy and data protection including laws and regulations relating to the collection storage handling use disclosure transfer and security of personal data The legislative and regulatory environment regarding privacy and data protection is continuously evolving and developing and the subject of significant attention globally For example we are subject to the EUs GDPR which became effective in May 2018 and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 which became effective in January 2020 both of which provide for substantial penalties for noncompliance Other jurisdictions where we operate have enacted or proposed similar legislation andor regulations Failure to comply with these current and future laws could result in significant penalties and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations Our sales and operations are subject to the risks of doing business internationally including in emerging markets As we continue our expansion efforts in emerging markets around the world through acquisitions and licensing transactions as well as through the development and introduction both independently and through collaborations such as our collaboration with BeiGene of our products in new markets we face numerous risks to our business There is no guarantee that our efforts and strategies to expand sales in emerging markets will succeed Our international business including in China and emerging market countries may be especially vulnerable to periods of global and local political legal regulatory and financial instability including issues of geopolitical relations the imposition of international sanctions in response to certain state actions andor sovereign debt issues We may also be required to increase our reliance on thirdparty agents and unfamiliar operations and arrangements including those previously utilized by companies we partner with or acquire in emerging markets See We must conduct clinical trials in humans before we commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications  Our expansion efforts in China and emerging markets around the world is dependent upon the establishment of an environment that is predictable navigable and supportive of biopharmaceutical innovation sustained access for our products and limited pricing controls For example China continues to strengthen regulations on the collection use and transmission of Chinese human genetic resources and has expanded regulations on the conduct of biotechnology RD activities in China Our applications to the Human Genetic Resources Administration of China HGRAC seeking approval to conduct clinical trials in China are delayed pending further guidance from HGRAC Our international operations and business may also be subject to less protective intellectual property or other applicable laws diverse data privacy and protection requirements changing tax laws and tariffs trade restrictions or other barriers designed to protect industry in the home country against foreign competition farreaching antibribery and anticorruption laws and regulations andor evolving legal and regulatory environments 33 As we expand internationally we are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the US dollar While we have a program in place that is designed to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations through foreign currency hedging arrangements our hedging efforts do not completely offset the effect of these fluctuations on our revenues and earnings In addition we have a number of financial instruments referencing the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR On July 27 2017 the UK Financial Conduct Authority which regulates LIBOR announced that it will no longer require banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR to the LIBOR administrator after 2021 and it is anticipated that LIBOR will be phased out and replaced by 2023 In March 2020 the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new accounting standard to ease the financial burdens of the expected market transition from LIBOR and other interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates While various replacement reference rates have been proposed an alternative reference rate to LIBOR has not yet been widely adopted and the specific mechanisms to replace LIBOR in our existing LIBORlinked financial instruments have not been finalized As such the replacement of LIBOR could have an adverse effect on the market for or value of our LIBORlinked financial instruments See Part IV Note 1 Summary of significant accounting policiesRecent accounting pronouncements We are also subject to the economic and political uncertainties stemming from the United Kingdoms exit from the EU commonly referred to as Brexit which occurred on January 31 2020 While our manufacturing and packaging activities take place largely outside the United Kingdom minimizing the need to make costly and significant changes to those operations we have nevertheless been working to put in place contingency plans to attempt to mitigate the effects of Brexit on us Overall the legal and operational challenges of our international business operations along with government controls the challenges of attracting and retaining qualified personnel and obtaining andor maintaining necessary regulatory or pricing approvals of our products may result in material adverse effects on our international product sales business and results of operations RISKS RELATED TO GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS AND THIRDPARTY POLICIES Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from government and commercial thirdparty payers and pricing and reimbursement pressures have affected and are likely to continue to affect our profitability Sales of our products depend on the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement from thirdparty payers including government healthcare programs and private insurance plans Governments and private payers continue to pursue initiatives to manage drug utilization and contain costs These payers are increasingly focused on the effectiveness benefits and costs of similar treatments which could result in lower reimbursement rates for our products or narrower populations for whom payers will reimburse Continued intense public scrutiny of the price of drugs and other healthcare costs together with payer dynamics have limited and are likely to continue to limit our ability to set or adjust the price of our products based on their value which could have a material adverse effect on our business In the United States particularly over the past few years a number of legislative and regulatory proposals have been introduced in an attempt to lower drug prices These include proposals that would allow the US government to negotiate drug price directly limit drug reimbursement based on prices abroad or permit importation of drugs from Canada Proposals focused on drug pricing are likely to continue to be proposed and may be adopted and implemented in some form 34 Changing US federal coverage and reimbursement policies and practices have affected and may continue to affect access to pricing and sales of our products A substantial portion of our US business relies on reimbursement from federal government healthcare programs and commercial insurance plans regulated by federal and state governments See Item 1 BusinessReimbursement Our business has been and will continue to be affected by legislative actions changing US federal reimbursement policy Since late 2018 Congressional focus on drug pricing has increased placing our industry under greater Congressional scrutiny For example in early 2019 the chair of the House Oversight and Reform Committee sent letters to twelve different biopharmaceutical manufacturers including Amgen seeking documents and detailed information about such companies drug pricing practices Subsequently in the fall of 2020 the House Oversight and Reform Committee released staff reports and held hearings with executives from six biopharmaceutical manufacturers including Amgen about their companies drug pricing practices Also between 2019 and 2020 a number of other Congressional committees held hearings and evaluated proposed legislation on drugpricing and payment policy For example in 2019 the Senate Finance Committee advanced a bill that would among other things penalize pharmaceutical manufacturers for raising prices on drugs covered by Medicare Parts B andor D faster than the rate of inflation cap outofpocket expenses for Medicare Part D beneficiaries and require higheradditional manufacturer discounts in Medicare Part D Additionally in late 2019 a drugpricing bill HR 3 passed the House of Representatives which would among other things enable direct price negotiations by the federal government on certain drugs with the maximum price paid by Medicare capped by prices derived from an international index includes a penalty for failing to reach agreement with the government and requires that manufacturers offer these negotiated prices to other payers We expect HR 3 or some similar proposed legislation to be debated by Congress this year Additional legislative or regulatory proposals have been introduced by members of Congress and the prior Administration that if enacted and implemented in whole or in part could also affect access to and sales of our products including but not limited to proposals to allow importation of prescription medications from Canada or other countries and to set Medicare payment rates using international price referencing Further in mid2020 the prior Administration announced a number of Executive Orders intended to reduce the cost of biopharmaceuticals for patients including a MFN policy for Medicare Parts B and D under which the HHS was directed to take steps to implement payment models that set Medicare purchase prices based on the lowest price available in economically comparable countries for certain Part B and Part D medicines In September 2020 in response to the corresponding Executive Order HHS released a final rule to allow states or other nonfederal government entities to submit proposals to the FDA allowing for the importation of certain nonbiologic prescription drugs from Canada Currently the rule is being challenged by litigation however should such litigation be unsuccessful and should the Secretary of HHS authorize state proposals for importation this rule could allow the importation of Canadian versions of certain of Amgens products including Otezla   that could have a material adverse effect on Amgens business Further in November 2020 also in response to the corresponding Executive Order HHS released an interim final rule to implement the MFN pricing approach If implemented the MFN rule would set the reimbursement rate for 50 Medicare Part B drugs including our products such as Prolia   XGEVA   KYPROLIS   Neulasta   Nplate   EPOGEN  and Aranesp   equal to the lowest adjusted price for such products of the 22 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD nations Lawsuits have been filed by certain trade groups challenging the implementation of this MFN rule based on among other things procedural defects Late in 2020 in the case filed by the Biotechnology Industry Organization and others the US District Court for the Northern District of California issued a preliminary injunction preventing the rule from taking effect nationwide pending the governments completion of required administrative procedures The case was subsequently stayed by the court and the parties were ordered to file a joint status report by April 23 2021 Another case filed by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America and others in the US District Court for the District of Maryland was also stayed Notwithstanding these stays the MFN rules approach to drug pricing and other similar approaches remain of interest Further despite the change in Administration we expect continued significant focus on healthcare and similar drug pricing proposals including proposals similar to the MFN rule for the foreseeable future Our business has been and is expected to continue to be affected by changes in US federal reimbursement policy resulting from federal regulations and federal demonstration projects For example the previous Administration released a drug pricing blueprint in 2018 which introduced an array of policy ideas intended to increase competition improve the negotiating power of the federal government reduce drug prices and lower patient outofpocket costs with the potential to significantly affect whether individually or collectively our industry Such policy ideas included but were not limited to moving coverage and reimbursement for Medicare Part B drugs into Medicare Part D and instituting a competitive acquisition program for Part B drugs in which competing thirdparty vendors take on the financial risk of acquiring drugs and billing Medicare 35 Also over the past three years federal agencies including the Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services CMS announced a number of recommendations policies proposals and demonstration projects to implement various elements of the drug pricing blueprint CMS is the federal agency responsible for administering Medicare and overseeing state Medicaid programs and Health Insurance Marketplaces and has substantial power to implement policy changes or demonstration projects that can quickly and significantly affect how drugs including our products are covered and reimbursed CMS issued guidance to allow certain Medicare plans offered by private insurance companies to require that patients receiving Medicare Part B drugs first try a drug preferred by the plan before covering another therapy Step Therapy and lowered reimbursement rates for new Medicare Part B drugs Further HHS issued a final rule under Medicare Part D revising the regulations under the federal antikickback statute to encourage PBMs to use rebates received from biopharmaceutical manufacturers to reduce patient costsharing at the point of sale Changes to the regulations will be phasedin beginning on March 22 2021 with all changes effective as of January 1 2023 However there are numerous logistical hurdles to overcome before such rule can be effectively implemented and it is unclear how PBMs will change their business practices in response Furthermore a trade association representing PBMs recently filed litigation challenging this HHS final rule Given these uncertainties it remains unclear when any anticipated benefits to patients will materialize The incoming Administration also could develop and seek to advance a range of policy proposals that could impact US federal reimbursement policy for drugs and biologics CMS policy changes and demonstration projects to test new care delivery and payment models can significantly affect how drugs including our products are covered and reimbursed In endstage renal disease ESRD CMS uses bundled payment rates Between 2018 and 2020 Sensipar  and Parsabiv   our calcimimetics that are used in dialysis clinics were eligible for temporary drug addon payment adjustments TDAPA to the bundled rate In November 2020 CMS released its final rule ending the TDAPA for calcimimetics and adjusting ESRD Prospective Payment System bundled rates on January 1 2021 by 993 per dialysis treatment for calcimimetics and we expect the sales of our calcimimetics to be materially adversely affected by this rule change Additionally CMS created a new mandatory payment model effective January 1 2021 focused on encouraging greater use of home dialysis and kidney transplants for ESRD patients that could result in changes to treatment of dialysis patients including reduction of the use of our ESAs Further back in November 2019 CMS announced additional voluntary payment models for nephrologists and dialysis facility partners that also seek to encourage home dialysis and preemptive transplantation through increased risk sharing but due to COVID19 the start date of such programs has been pushed back to April 1 2021 CMS has also solicited suggestions regarding other potential care models In 2016 CMS initiated the Oncology Care Model demonstration which provides participating physician practices with performancebased financial incentives that aim to manage or reduce Medicare costs without negatively affecting the efficacy of care that has been extended by one year to 2022 due to COVID19 We believe the Oncology Care Model has reduced utilization of certain of our oncology products by participating physician practices and expect it to continue to do so in the future Additionally in late 2019 CMS announced a request for information on the Oncology Care First model a new voluntary model that builds on the Oncology Care Model CMS recently finalized a rule that starting January 1 2023 unless a manufacturer can ensure that the full amount of manufacturer patient assistance programs is passed on to the patient such amount will be treated as a price reduction that will be taken into account when reporting our Best Price andor Average Manufacturer Price AMP Given the use by PBMs and insurers of copay accumulator adjustment programs to apply such patient assistance for the benefit of such companies and not to defray costs to patients it could be difficult to impossible for manufacturers to ensure that the full value of such amounts is being passed on to the patient This new policy if implemented would have significant implications for our ability to offer copay assistance programs In this dynamic environment we are unable to predict which or how many federal policy legislative regulatory executive or administrative changes may ultimately be or effectively estimate the consequences to our business if enacted and implemented However to the extent that these or other federal government initiatives further decrease or modify the coverage or reimbursement available for our products require that we pay increased rebates or shift other costs to us limit or affect our decisions regarding the pricing of or otherwise reduce the use of our US products or limit our ability to offer copay payment assistance to commercial patients such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations We also face risks relating to the reporting of pricing data that affects the reimbursement of and discounts provided for our products US government price reporting regulations are complex and may require a biopharmaceutical manufacturer to update certain previously submitted data If our submitted pricing data are incorrect we may become subject to substantial fines and penalties or other government enforcement actions which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations In addition as a result of restating previously reported price data we also may be required to pay additional rebates and provide additional discounts 36 Changing reimbursement and pricing actions in various states have negatively affected and may continue to negatively affect access to and have affected and may continue to affect sales of our products At the state level government actions or ballot initiatives can also affect how our products are covered and reimbursed andor create additional pressure on our pricing decisions A number of states have adopted and many other states are considering drug importation programs or other new pricing actions including proposals designed to require biopharmaceutical manufacturers publicly to report proprietary pricing information limit price increases or place a maximum price ceiling or cap on biopharmaceutical products Existing and proposed state pricing laws have added complexity to the pricing of drugs and may already be affecting industry pricing decisions For example a California law the constitutionality of which is currently being challenged purports to require biopharmaceutical manufacturers to notify health insurers and government health plans at least 60 days before scheduled prescription drug price increases that exceed certain thresholds Similar laws exist in Oregon and Washington States are also seeking to change the way they pay for drugs for patients covered by state programs California adopted a 202021 budget that incorporates international pricing into Medicaid supplemental rebate negotiations and allows its Medicaid program to seek federal approval to extend supplemental rebates to nonMedicaid populations New York Massachusetts and Ohio have established Medicaid drug spending caps and additional states may consider doing so as they face budget deficits from the effects of COVID19 Additionally Colorado Florida Maine New Hampshire New Mexico and Vermont have enacted laws and several other states have proposed laws to facilitate the importation of drugs from Canada Other states could adopt similar approaches or could pursue different policy changes in a continuing effort to reduce their costs Ultimately as with US federal government actions existing or future state government actions or ballot initiatives may also have a material adverse effect on our product sales business and results of operations US commercial payer actions have affected and may continue to affect access to and sales of our products Payers including healthcare insurers PBMs integrated healthcare delivery systems verticallyintegrated organizations built from the consolidation of healthcare insurers and PBMs and group purchasing organizations increasingly seek ways to reduce their costs With increasing frequency payers are adopting benefit plan changes that shift a greater proportion of drug costs to patients Such measures include more limited benefit plan designs high deductible plans higher patient copay or coinsurance obligations and more significant limitations on patients use of manufacturer commercial copay assistance programs Further government regulation of payers may affect these trends For example CMS recently finalized a policy that could cause commercial payers to adopt copay accumulator adjustment programs more widely Payers have sought and will likely continue to seek price discounts or rebates in connection with the placement of our products on their formularies or those they manage particularly in treatment areas where the payer has taken the position that multiple branded products are therapeutically comparable Payers also control costs by imposing restrictions on access to or usage of our products such as Step Therapy or requiring that patients receive the payers prior authorization before covering the product or that patients use a mailorder pharmacy or a limited network of payer fullyowned mailorder or specialty pharmacies Payers may also choose to exclude certain indications for which our products are approved or even choose to exclude coverage entirely For example some payers require physicians to demonstrate or document that the patients for whom Repatha  has been prescribed meet payer utilization management criteria and these requirements have limited and may continue to limit patient access to Repatha  treatment In an effort to reduce barriers to access we reduced the net price of Repatha  by providing greater discounts and rebates to payers including PBMs that administer Medicare Part D prescription drug plans However affordability of patient outofpocket copay cost has limited and may continue to limit patient use For example in late 2018 and early 2019 in response to a very high percentage of Medicare patients abandoning their Repatha  prescriptions rather than pay their copay payment we introduced a set of new National Drug Codes to make Repatha  available at a lower list price to attempt to address affordability for patients particularly those on Medicare and on December 31 2019 we discontinued the higher list price option for Repatha   Despite these net and list price reductions some payers have restricted and may continue to restrict patient access and may change formulary coverage for Repatha   seek further discounts or rebates or take other actions that could reduce our sales of Repatha   These factors have limited and may continue to limit patient affordability and use and negatively affect Repatha  sales 37 Further significant consolidation in the health insurance industry has resulted in a few large insurers and PBMs which places greater pressure on pricing and usage negotiations with biopharmaceutical manufacturers significantly increasing discount and rebate requirements and limiting patient access and usage For example in the United States in 2020 the top five integrated health plans and PBMs controlled about 85 of all pharmacy prescriptions The consolidation among insurers PBMs and other payers including through integrated healthcare delivery systems andor with specialty or mailorder pharmacies and pharmacy retailers has increased the negotiating leverage such entities have over us and other biopharmaceutical manufacturers and has resulted in greater price discounts rebates and service fees realized by those payers In 2019 and 2020 CVS and Express Scripts created Rebate Management Organizations that further increase their respective leverage to negotiate deeper discounts Ultimately additional discounts rebates fees coverage or plan changes restrictions or exclusions imposed by these commercial payers could have a material adverse effect on our product sales business and results of operations Policy reforms advanced by Congress or the Administration that refine the role of PBMs in the US marketplace could have downstream implications or consequences for our business and how we interact with these entities Government and commercial payer actions outside the United States have affected and will continue to affect access to and sales of our products Outside the United States we expect countries will also continue to take actions to reduce their drug expenditures See Item 1 BusinessReimbursement IRP has been widely used by many countries outside the United States to control costs based on an external benchmark of a products price in other countries IRP policies can change quickly and frequently and may not reflect differences in the burden of disease indications market structures or affordability differences across countries or regions In addition countries may refuse to reimburse or may restrict the reimbursed population for a product when their national health technology assessments do not consider a medicine to demonstrate sufficient clinical benefit beyond existing therapies or to meet certain cost effectiveness thresholds For example despite the EMAs approval of Repatha  for the treatment of patients with established atherosclerotic disease the reimbursement for Repatha  in France is limited to a narrower patient population such as those with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia following a national health technology assessment While the pricing and reimbursement process in that country remains ongoing the assessment currently limits our efforts in France to expand Repatha  access to the broader patient population covered by the approved label Some countries decide on reimbursement between potentially competing products through national or regional tenders that often result in one product receiving most or all of the sales in that country or region Failure to obtain coverage and reimbursement for our products a deterioration in their existing coverage and reimbursement or a decline in the timeliness or certainty of payment by payers to physicians and other providers has negatively affected and may further negatively affect the ability or willingness of healthcare providers to prescribe our products for their patients and otherwise negatively affect the use of our products or the prices we realize for them Such changes have had and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our product sales business and results of operations Guidelines and recommendations published by various organizations can reduce the use of our products Government agencies promulgate regulations and guidelines directly applicable to us and to our products Professional societies practice management groups insurance carriers physicians groups private health and science foundations and organizations involved in various diseases also publish guidelines and recommendations to healthcare providers administrators and payers as well as patient communities Recommendations by government agencies or other groups and organizations may relate to such matters as usage dosage route of administration and use of related therapies In addition a growing number of organizations are providing assessments of the value and pricing of biopharmaceutical products and even organizations whose guidelines have historically been focused on clinical matters have begun to incorporate analyses of the cost effectiveness of various treatments into their treatment guidelines and recommendations Value assessments may come from private organizations that publish their findings and offer recommendations relating to the products reimbursement by government and private payers Some companies and payers have announced pricing and payment decisions based in part on the assessments of private organizations In addition government health technology assessment organizations in many countries make reimbursement recommendations to payers in their jurisdictions based on the clinical effectiveness costeffectiveness and service effects of new emerging and existing medicines and treatments Such health technology assessment organizations have recommended and may in the future recommend reimbursement for certain of our products for a narrower indication than was approved by applicable regulatory agencies or may recommend against reimbursement entirely See Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from government and commercial thirdparty payers and pricing and reimbursement pressures have affected and are likely to continue to affect our profitability Such recommendations or guidelines may affect our reputation and any recommendations or guidelines that result in decreased use dosage or reimbursement of our products could have a material adverse effect on our product sales business and results of operations In addition the perception by the investment community or stockholders that such recommendations or guidelines will result in decreased use and dosage of our products could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 38 The adoption and interpretation of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability We are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and other jurisdictions in which we do business As a result our provision for income taxes is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various places we operate Significant judgment is required for determining our provision for income tax Our tax returns are routinely examined by tax authorities in the United States and other jurisdictions in which we do business and a number of audits are currently underway Tax authorities including the Internal Revenue Service IRS are becoming more aggressive in their audits and are particularly focused on the allocations of income and expense among tax jurisdictions In 2017 we received a Revenue Agent Report RAR and a modified RAR from the IRS for the years 2010 2011 and 2012 proposing significant adjustments that primarily relate to the allocation of profits between certain of our entities in the United States and the US territory of Puerto Rico We disagree with the proposed adjustments and calculations and have been pursuing resolution with the IRS administrative appeals office However we have been unable to reach resolution at the administrative appeals level and we anticipate that we will receive a Notice of Deficiency which we would expect to vigorously contest through the judicial process In addition in 2020 we received an RAR and a modified RAR from the IRS for the years 2013 2014 and 2015 also proposing significant adjustments that primarily relate to the allocation of profits between certain of our entities in the United States and the US territory of Puerto Rico similar to those proposed for the years 2010 2011 and 2012 We disagree with the 2013 2014 and 2015 proposed adjustments and calculations and are pursuing resolution with the IRS administrative appeals office The IRS audit for years 2016 2017 and 2018 is expected to start in the near term We are also currently under examination by a number of other state and foreign tax jurisdictions Final resolution of these complex matters is not likely within the next 12 months We believe our accrual for income tax liabilities is appropriate based on past experience interpretations of tax law application of the tax law to our facts and judgments about potential actions by tax authorities however due to the complexity of the provision for income taxes and uncertain resolution of these matters the ultimate outcome of any tax matters may result in payments substantially greater than amounts accrued and could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations Our provision for income taxes and results of operations in the future could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure changes in the mix of income and expenses in countries with differing tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in applicable tax laws regulations or administrative interpretations thereof The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act the 2017 Tax Act is complex and a large volume of regulations and guidance has been issued and could be subject to different interpretations We could face audit challenges to our application of the 2017 Tax Act The new Administration and Congress could make changes to existing tax law including an increase in the corporate tax rate and the tax rate on foreign earnings Changes to existing tax law in the US the US territory of Puerto Rico or other jurisdictions including efforts by the OECD to align countries on corporate tax matters that would likely result in tax increases where we do business could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations Our business may be affected by litigation and government investigations We and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in legal proceedings See Part IVNote 19 Contingencies and commitments to the Consolidated Financial Statements Civil and criminal litigation is inherently unpredictable and the outcome can result in costly verdicts fines and penalties exclusion from federal healthcare programs andor injunctive relief that affect how we operate our business Defense of litigation claims can be expensive time consuming and distracting and it is possible that we could incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims for monetary damages or change the way we operate our business which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales business and results of operations In addition product liability is a major risk in testing and marketing biotechnology and pharmaceutical products We may face substantial product liability exposure in human clinical trials and for products we sell after regulatory approval Product liability claims regardless of their merits could be costly and divert managements attention and could adversely affect our reputation and the demand for our products We and certain of our subsidiaries have previously been named as defendants in product liability actions for certain of our products 39 We are also involved in government investigations that arise in the ordinary course of our business In recent years there has been a trend of increasing government investigations and litigations against companies operating in our industry both in the United States and around the world See Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from thirdparty payers and pricing and reimbursement pressures may affect our profitability Our business activities outside of the United States are subject to the FCPA and similar antibribery or anticorruption laws regulations or rules of other countries in which we operate including the UK Bribery Act We cannot ensure that all our employees agents contractors vendors licensees partners or collaborators will comply with all applicable laws and regulations On April 25 2019 we entered into a settlement agreement with the DOJ and the OIG of the HHS to settle certain allegations relating to our support of independent charitable organizations that provide patients with financial assistance to access their medicines As a result we entered into a corporate integrity agreement with the OIG that requires us to maintain a corporate compliance program and to undertake a set of defined corporate integrity obligations for a period of five years While we expect to fully comply with all of our obligations under the corporate integrity agreement failure to do so could result in substantial penalties and potential exclusion from government healthcare programs We may also see new government investigations of or actions against us citing novel theories of recovery For example prosecutors are placing greater scrutiny on patient support programs including commercial copay assistance programs and further enforcement actions and investigations regarding such programs could limit our ability to provide copay assistance to commercial patients Greater scrutiny has also been placed on sponsorships speaker programs and other arrangements where healthcare professionals receive remuneration travel or other value to participate in certain events and further enforcement actions could limit our ability to participate in such arrangements Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations RISKS RELATED TO COMPETITION Our products face substantial competition and our product candidates are also likely to face substantial competition We operate in a highly competitive environment See Item 1 BusinessMarketing Distribution and Selected Marketed ProductsCompetition We expect that our products and product candidates will compete with existing drugs new drugs currently in development drugs currently approved for other indications that may later be approved for the same indications as those of our products and drugs approved for other indications that are used offlabel Large pharmaceutical companies and generics manufacturers of pharmaceutical products are expanding into the biotechnology field and some pharmaceutical companies and generics manufacturers have formed partnerships to pursue biosimilars With the proliferation of companies pursuing biopharmaceuticals a number of our product candidates may enter markets with one or more competitors or with competitors soon to arrive In addition some of our competitors may have technical competitive or other advantages over us for the development of technologies and processes or greater experience in particular therapeutic areas and consolidation among pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can enhance such advantages These advantages may make it difficult for us to compete with them successfully to discover develop and market new products and for our current products to compete with new products or new product indications they may bring to market As a result our products have been competing and may continue to compete and our product candidates may compete against products or product candidates that offer higher rebates or discounts lower prices equivalent or superior efficacy better safety profiles easier administration earlier market availability or other competitive features If we are unable to compete effectively this could reduce sales which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 40 Our intellectual property positions may be challenged invalidated or circumvented or we may fail to prevail in current and future intellectual property litigation Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and defend patent rights and other intellectual property rights that are important to the commercialization of our products and product candidates The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and often involve complex legal scientific and factual questions Driven by cost pressures efforts to limit or weaken patent protection for our industry are increasing For example the COVID19 pandemic has resulted in increased interest in compulsory licenses marchin rights or other governmental interventions both in the United States and internationally related to the procurement of drugs See The COVID19 pandemic and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of the disease have had and are expected to continue to have an adverse effect and may have a material adverse effect on our clinical trials operations supply chains distribution systems product development product sales business and results of operations Third parties have challenged and may continue to challenge invalidate or circumvent our patents and patent applications relating to our products product candidates and technologies Challenges to patents may come from potential competitors or from parties other than those who seek to market a potentiallyinfringing product In addition our patent positions might not protect us against competitors with similar products or technologies because competing products or technologies may not infringe our patents For certain of our product candidates there are third parties who have patents or pending patent applications that they may claim necessitate payment of a royalty or prevent us from commercializing these product candidates in certain territories Patent disputes are frequent costly and can preclude delay or increase the cost of commercialization of products We have been in the past are currently and expect to be in the future involved in patent litigation These matters have included and may in the future include litigation with manufacturers of products that purport to be biosimilars of certain of our products for patent infringement and for failure to comply with certain provisions of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 BPCIA A determination made by a court agency or tribunal concerning infringement validity enforceability injunctive or economic remedy or the right to patent protection for example are typically subject to appellate or administrative review Upon review such initial determinations may be afforded little or no deference by the reviewing tribunal and may be affirmed reversed or made the subject of reconsideration through further proceedings A patent dispute or litigation has not discouraged and may not in the future discourage a potential violator from bringing the allegedlyinfringing product to market prior to a final resolution of the dispute or litigation The period from inception until resolution of a patent dispute or litigation is subject to the availability and schedule of the court agency or tribunal before which the dispute or litigation is pending We have been and may in the future be subject to competition during this period and may not be able to recover fully from the losses damages and harms we incur from infringement by the competitor product even if we prevail Moreover if we lose or settle current or future litigations at certain stages or entirely we could be subject to competition andor significant liabilities be required to enter into thirdparty licenses for the infringed product or technology or be required to cease using the technology or product in dispute In addition we cannot guarantee that such licenses will be available on terms acceptable to us or at all Further under the HatchWaxman Act our products approved by the FDA under the FDCA have been and may in the future be the subject of patent litigation with generics competitors before expiry of the fiveyear period of data exclusivity provided for under the HatchWaxman Act and prior to the expiration of the patents listed for the product Likewise our innovative biologic products have been and may in the future be the subject of patent litigation prior to the expiration of our patents and with respect to competitors seeking approval as a biosimilar or interchangeable version of our products prior to the 12year exclusivity period provided under the BPCIA In addition we may face patent litigation involving claims that the biosimilar product candidates we are working to develop infringe the patents of other companies including those that manufacture market or sell the applicable reference products or who are developing or have developed other biosimilar versions of such products Due to the COVID19 pandemic there may be delays in ongoing or new patent office or court proceedings in the US or abroad that may delay the outcome of such proceedings While we have attempted and expect to continue to attempt to challenge the patents held by other companies our efforts may be unsuccessful Alternatively such patents have contributed and may in the future contribute to a decision by us to not pursue all of the same labeled indications as are held by these companies For examples of and information related to our patent litigation see Part IVNote 19 Contingencies and commitments to the Consolidated Financial Statements Certain of the existing patents on our products have expired See Item 1 BusinessMarketing Distribution and Selected Marketed ProductsPatents As our patents expire competitors are able to legally produce and market similar products or technologies including biosimilars which has had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our product sales business and results of operations In addition competitors have been and may continue to be able to invalidate design around or otherwise circumvent our patents and sell competing products 41 We currently face competition from biosimilars and generics and expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars and generics in the future We currently face competition from biosimilars and generics in most of the territories in which we operate including Europe and the United States and we expect to face increasing biosimilar andor generics competition this year and beyond Expiration or successful challenge of applicable patent rights or expiration of an applicable exclusivity period has accelerated such competition and we expect to face more litigation regarding the validity andor scope of our patents Our products have also experienced greater competition from lower cost biosimilars or generics that come to market when branded products that compete with our products lose their own patent protection To the extent that governments adopt more permissive regulatory approval standards and competitors are able to obtain broader or expedited marketing approval for biosimilars and generics the rate of increased competition for our products could accelerate In the EU biosimilars are evaluated for marketing authorization pursuant to a set of general and product classspecific guidelines In addition in an effort to spur biosimilar utilization andor increase potential healthcare savings some EU countries and some Canadian provinces have adopted or are considering the adoption of biosimilar uptake measures such as physician prescribing quotas or automatic pharmacy substitution of biosimilars for the corresponding reference products Some EU countries impose automatic price reductions upon market entry of one or more biosimilar competitors While the degree of competitive effects of biosimilar competition differs between EU countries and between products in the EU the overall use of biosimilars and the rate at which product sales of innovative products are being affected by biosimilar competition is increasing In the United States the BPCIA authorizes the FDA to approve biosimilars via a separate abbreviated pathway See Item 1 BusinessGovernment RegulationRegulation in the United StatesApproval of Biosimilars The first biosimilar entrant into the US market was Sandozs Zarxio  filgrastimsndz a biosimilar version of NEUPOGEN   in 2015 Since then the FDA has approved additional biosimilars including biosimilar versions of Neulasta   EPOGEN  and ENBREL and a growing number of companies have announced that they are also developing biosimilar versions of our products Four biosimilar versions of Neulasta  are now marketed in the United States and we expect other biosimilar versions of Neulasta  to receive approval in 2021 and beyond Impact to our Neulasta  sales has accelerated as additional competitors have launched See Item 1 BusinessMarketing Distribution and Selected Marketed ProductsCompetition An approved biosimilar version of EPOGEN  has also launched in the United States and we are currently involved in patent litigations with the manufacturers of the approved biosimilar versions of ENBREL Manufacturers of biosimilars have attempted and may in the future attempt to compete with our products by offering lower list prices greater discounts or rebates or contracts that offer longerterm pricing or a broader portfolio of other products Companies pursuing development of biosimilar versions of our products have challenged and may continue to challenge our patents well in advance of the expiration of our material patents For example we recently successfully defended our ENBREL patents against a litigation challenge For examples of and information related to our biosimilars and generics patent litigation see Part IVNote 19 Contingencies and commitments to the Consolidated Financial Statements See Our intellectual property positions may be challenged invalidated or circumvented or we may fail to prevail in current and future intellectual property litigation The US pathway includes the option for biosimilar products that meet certain criteria to be approved as interchangeable with their reference products Some companies currently developing or already marketing biosimilars may seek to obtain interchangeable status from the FDA which could potentially allow pharmacists to substitute those biosimilars for our reference products without prior approval from the prescriber in most states In November 2019 the FDA issued draft guidance that provides that comparative immunogenicity studies will not generally be expected for biosimilar and interchangeable insulin products This may open the door for other productspecific guidance development and the removal of the expectation for certain studies which may contribute to increased biosimilar competition for our innovative products In addition critics of the 12year exclusivity period in the biosimilar pathway law will likely continue to seek to shorten the data exclusivity period andor to encourage the FDA to interpret narrowly the laws provisions regarding which new products receive data exclusivity In late 2019 the previous Administration agreed to remove from the United StatesMexicoCanada Agreement a requirement for at least 10 years of data exclusivity for biologic products Also the FDA is considering whether subsequent changes to a licensed biologic would be protected by the remainder of the reference products original 12year exclusivity period a concept known in the generic drug context as umbrella exclusivity If the FDA were to decide that umbrella exclusivity does not apply to biological reference products or were to make other changes to the exclusivity period this could expose us to biosimilar competition at an earlier time There also have been and may continue to be legislative and regulatory efforts to promote competition through policies enabling easier generic and biosimilar approval and commercialization including efforts to lower standards for demonstrating biosimilarity or interchangeability limit patents that may be litigated andor patent settlements implement preferential reimbursement policies for biosimilars and passage of new laws requiring more disclosure in the FDAs Orange and Purple Books 42 Upon the expiration or loss of patent protection andor applicable exclusivity for one of our small molecule products we can lose the majority of revenues for that product in a very short period of time See Item 1 BusinessMarketing Distribution and Selected Marketed ProductsCompetition Additionally if one of our small molecule products is the subject of an FDA Written Request for pediatric studies and we are unable to adequately complete these studies we may not obtain the pediatric exclusivity award that extends existing patents for the product by an additional six months For example as a result of the product already introduced andor that could further be introduced into the US market our product sales for Sensipar  have been adversely affected and could be further materially and adversely affected by competing generics California is the first state to have passed legislation effective on January 1 2020 against pay for delay settlements of patent infringement claims filed by manufacturers of generics or biosimilars where anything of value is given in exchange for settlement Under this law such settlement agreements are presumptively anticompetitive The law may result in prolonged litigation and fewer settlements Other states including Connecticut New York Illinois and Minnesota may adopt similar laws or a similar law could be adopted at the federal level While we are unable to predict the precise effects of biosimilars and generics on our products we are currently facing and expect to face greater competition in the United States Europe and elsewhere in 2021 and beyond as a result of biosimilar and generic competition and in turn downward pressure on our product prices and sales This competition has had and could increasingly have a material adverse effect on our product sales business and results of operations Concentration of sales at certain of our wholesaler distributors and at one freestanding dialysis clinic business and consolidation of private payers may negatively affect our business Certain of our distributors customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage due to the volume of our products they purchase or the number of patient lives for which they provide coverage The substantial majority of our US product sales is made to three pharmaceutical product wholesaler distributors AmerisourceBergen McKesson and Cardinal Health These distributors in turn sell our products to their customers which include physicians or their clinics dialysis centers hospitals and pharmacies One of our products EPOGEN   is sold primarily to freestanding dialysis clinics DaVita owns or manages a large number of the outpatient dialysis facilities located in the United States and accounts for approximately 90 of all EPOGEN  sales Similarly as discussed above there has been significant consolidation in the health insurance industry including that a small number of PBMs now oversee a substantial percentage of total covered lives in the United States See Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from thirdparty payers and pricing and reimbursement pressures may affect our profitability  The three largest PBMs in the United States are now part of major health insurance providers The growing concentration of purchasing and negotiating power by these entities may put pressure on our pricing due to their ability to extract price discounts on our products fees for other services or rebates negatively affecting our bargaining position sales andor profit margins In addition decisions by these entities to purchase or cover less or none of our products in favor of competitive products could have a material adverse effect on our product sales business and results of operations due to their purchasing volume Further if one of our significant wholesale distributors encounters financial or other difficulties and becomes unable or unwilling to pay us all amounts that such distributor owes us on a timely basis or at all it could negatively affect our business and results of operations In addition if one of our significant wholesale distributors becomes insolvent or otherwise unable to continue its commercial relationship with us in its present form it could significantly disrupt our business and adversely affect our product sales our business and results of operations unless suitable alternatives are timely found or lost sales are absorbed by another distributor RISKS RELATED TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT We may not be able to develop commercial products despite significant investments in RD Amgen invests heavily in RD Successful product development in the biotechnology industry is highly uncertain and very few RD projects produce commercial products Product candidates including biosimilar product candidates or new indications for existing products collectively product candidates that appear promising in the early phases of development may fail to reach the market for a number of reasons such as  the product candidate did not demonstrate acceptable clinical trial results even though it achieved its primary endpoints andor demonstrated positive preclinical or early clinical trial results for reasons that could include changes in the standard of care of medicine or expectations of health authorities  the product candidate was not effective or not more effective than currently available therapies in treating a specified condition or illness  the product candidate was not cost effective in light of existing therapeutics  the product candidate had harmful side effects in animals or humans 43  the necessary regulatory bodies such as the FDA or EMA did not approve the product candidate for an intended use  the product candidate was not economical for us to manufacture and commercialize  other parties had or may have had proprietary rights relating to our product candidate such as patent rights and did not let us sell it on reasonable terms or at all  we and certain of our licensees partners contracted organizations or independent investigators may have failed to effectively conduct clinical development or clinical manufacturing activities  the pathway to regulatory approval or reimbursement for product candidates was uncertain or not welldefined  the biosimilar product candidate failed to demonstrate the requisite biosimilarity to the applicable reference product or was otherwise determined by a regulatory authority to not meet applicable standards for approval and  a companion diagnostic device that is required with the use of a product candidate is not approved by the necessary regulatory authority We have spent considerable time energy and resources developing our expertise in human genetics and acquiring access to libraries of genetic information with the belief that genetics could meaningfully aid our search for new medicines and help guide our RD decisions and investments We have focused our RD strategy on drug targets validated by genetic or other compelling human evidence However product candidates based on genetically validated targets remain subject to the uncertainties of the drug development process and may not reach the market for a number of reasons including the factors listed above A number of our product candidates have failed or been discontinued at various stages in the product development process For example in 2015 we terminated our participation in the codevelopment and commercialization of brodalumab a product candidate that was in phase 3 with AstraZeneca The decision was based on events of suicidal ideation and behavior in the brodalumab program that occurred late in the development program which we believed likely would necessitate restrictive labeling that would limit the appropriate patient population Inability to bring a product to market or a significant delay in the expected approval and related launch date of a new product for any of the reasons discussed could potentially have a negative effect on our product sales and earnings and could result in a significant impairment of inprocess research and development IPRD or other intangible assets We must conduct clinical trials in humans before we commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications Before we sell any products we must conduct clinical trials to demonstrate that our product candidates are safe and effective for use in humans The results of those clinical trials are used as the basis to obtain approval from regulatory authorities such as the FDA and EMA See Our current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval  We are required to conduct clinical trials using an appropriate number of trial sites and patients to support the product label claims The length of time number of trial sites and number of patients required for clinical trials vary substantially and we may spend several years and incur substantial expense in completing certain clinical trials In addition we may have difficulty finding a sufficient number of clinical trial sites and patients to participate in our clinical trials particularly if competitors are conducting clinical trials in similar patient populations See The COVID19 pandemic and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of the disease have had and are expected to continue to have an adverse effect and may have a material adverse effect on our clinical trials operations supply chains distribution systems product development product sales business and results of operations Patients may withdraw from clinical trials at any time and privacy laws andor other restrictions in certain countries may restrict the ability of clinical trial investigators to conduct further followup on such patients which may adversely affect the interpretation of study results Delays and complications in planned clinical trials can result in increased development costs associated delays in regulatory approvals and in product candidates reaching the market and revisions to existing product labels 44 Further to increase the number of patients available for enrollment in our clinical trials we have opened and will continue to open clinical sites and enroll patients in a number of locations where our experience conducting clinical trials is more limited including Russia India China South Korea the Philippines Singapore and some Central and South American countries either through utilization of thirdparty contract clinical trial providers entirely or in combination with local staff Conducting clinical trials in locations where we have limited experience requires substantial time and resources to understand the unique regulatory environments of individual countries For other examples of the risks of conducting clinical trials in China see also Our sales and operations are subject to the risks of doing business internationally including in emerging markets  Further we must ensure the timely production distribution and delivery of the clinical supply of our product candidates to numerous and varied clinical trial sites Additionally regional disruptions including natural and manmade disasters or health emergencies such as novel viruses or pandemics such as the one we are currently experiencing with COVID19 could significantly disrupt the timing of clinical trials If we fail to adequately manage the design execution and diverse regulatory aspects of our large andor complex clinical trials or to manage the production or distribution of our clinical supply or such sites experience disruptions as a result of a naturalmanmade disaster or health emergency corresponding regulatory approvals may be delayed or we may fail to gain approval for our product candidates or could lose our ability to market existing products in certain therapeutic areas or altogether For example our clinical trials have been adversely affected by the COVID19 pandemic See The COVID19 pandemic and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of the disease have had and are expected to continue to have an adverse effect and may have a material adverse effect on our clinical trials operations supply chains distribution systems product development product sales business and results of operations If we are unable to market and sell our products or product candidates or to obtain approvals in the timeframe needed to execute our product strategies our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected We rely on independent thirdparty clinical investigators to recruit patients and conduct clinical trials on our behalf in accordance with applicable study protocols laws and regulations Further we rely on unaffiliated thirdparty vendors to perform certain aspects of our clinical trial operations In some circumstances we enter into codevelopment arrangements with other pharmaceutical and medical devices companies that provide for the other company to conduct certain clinical trials for the product we are codeveloping or to develop a diagnostic test used in screening or monitoring patients in our clinical trials See Some of our pharmaceutical pipeline and of our commercial product sales rely on collaborations with third parties which may adversely affect the development and sale of our products We also may acquire companies that have past or ongoing clinical trials or rights to products or product candidates for which clinical trials have been or are being conducted These trials may not have been conducted to the same standards as ours however once an acquisition has been completed we assume responsibility for the conduct of these trials including any potential risks and liabilities associated with the past and prospective conduct of those trials If regulatory authorities determine that we or others including our licensees or codevelopment partners or the independent investigators or vendors selected by us our codevelopment partners or by a company we have acquired or from which we have acquired rights to a product or product candidate have not complied with regulations applicable to the clinical trials those authorities may refuse or reject some or all of the clinical trial data or take other actions that could delay or otherwise negatively affect our ability to obtain or maintain marketing approval of the product or indication In addition delays or failures to develop diagnostic tests for our clinical trials can affect the timely enrollment of such trials and lead to delays or inability to obtain marketing approval If we were unable to market and sell our products or product candidates our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected In addition some of our clinical trials utilize drugs manufactured and marketed by other pharmaceutical companies These drugs may be administered in clinical trials in combination with one of our products or product candidates or in a headtohead study comparing the products or product candidates relative efficacy and safety In the event that any of these vendors or pharmaceutical companies have unforeseen issues that negatively affect the quality of their work product or create a shortage of supply or if we are otherwise unable to obtain an adequate supply of these other drugs our ability to complete our applicable clinical trials andor evaluate clinical results may also be negatively affected As a result such quality or supply problems could adversely affect our ability to timely file for gain or maintain regulatory approvals worldwide Clinical trials must generally be designed based on the current standard of medical care However in certain diseases such as cancer the standard of care is evolving rapidly In some cases we may design a clinical trial based on the standard of care we anticipate will exist at the time our study is completed The duration of time needed to complete certain clinical trials may result in the design of such clinical trials being based on standards of medical care that are no longer or that have not become the current standards by the time such trials are completed limiting the utility and application of such trials Additionally the views of regulatory agencies relating to the requirements for accelerated approval may change over time and trial designs that were sufficient to support accelerated approvals for some oncology products may not be considered sufficient for later candidates We may not obtain favorable clinical trial results and therefore may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for new product candidates or new indications for existing products andor maintain our current product labels Participants in clinical trials of our products and product candidates may also suffer adverse medical events or side effects that could among other factors delay or terminate clinical trial programs andor require additional or longer trials to gain approval 45 Even after a product is on the market safety concerns may require additional or more extensive clinical trials as part of a risk management plan for our product or for approval of a new indication For example in connection with the June 2011 ESA label changes we agreed to and conducted additional clinical trials examining the use of ESAs in CKD Additional clinical trials we initiate including those required by the FDA could result in substantial additional expense and the outcomes could result in further label restrictions or the loss of regulatory approval for an approved indication each of which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales business and results of operations Additionally any negative results from such trials could materially affect the extent of approvals the use reimbursement and sales of our products our business and results of operations Our current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval Our business is subject to extensive regulation by numerous state and federal government authorities in the United States including the FDA and by foreign regulatory authorities including the EMA We are required in the United States and in foreign countries to obtain approval from regulatory authorities before we manufacture market and sell our products Once our products are approved the FDA and other US and foreign regulatory agencies have substantial authority to require additional testing and reporting perform inspections change product labeling or mandate withdrawals of our products Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may subject us to administrative andor judicially imposed sanctions or monetary penalties as well as reputational and other harms The sanctions could include the FDAs or foreign regulatory authorities refusals to approve pending applications delays in obtaining or withdrawals of approvals delays or suspensions of clinical trials warning letters product recalls or seizures total or partial suspensions of our operations injunctions fines civil penalties andor criminal prosecutions Obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals have been and will continue to be increasingly difficult timeconsuming and costly Legislative bodies or regulatory agencies could enact new laws or regulations change existing laws or regulations or change their interpretations of laws or regulations at any time which could affect our ability to obtain or maintain approval of our products or product candidates The rate and degree of change in existing laws and regulations and regulatory expectations have accelerated in established markets and regulatory expectations continue to evolve in emerging markets We are unable to predict whether and when any further changes to laws or regulatory policies affecting our business could occur such as changes to laws or regulations governing manufacturer communications concerning drug products and drug product candidates and whether such changes could have a material adverse effect on our product sales business and results of operations In the United States a partial federal government shutdown halted the work of many federal agencies and their employees from late December 2018 through late January 2019 A subsequent extended shutdown could result in reductions or delays of FDAs activities including with respect to our ongoing clinical programs our manufacturing of our products and product candidates and our product approvals Regulatory authorities have questioned and may in the future question the sufficiency for approval of the endpoints we select for our clinical trials A number of our products and product candidates have been evaluated in clinical trials using surrogate endpoints that measure an effect that is known to correlate with an ultimate clinical benefit For example a therapeutic oncology product candidate may be evaluated for its ability to reduce or eliminate minimal residual disease MRD or to extend the length of time during and after the treatment that a patient lives without the disease worsening measured by PFS Demonstrating that the product candidate induces MRDnegative responses or produces a statistically significant improvement in PFS does not necessarily mean that the product candidate will show a statistically significant improvement in overall survival or the time that the patients remain alive In the CV setting a heart disease therapeutic candidate may be evaluated for its ability to reduce LDLC levels as an elevated LDLC level has been a surrogate endpoint for CV events such as death heart attack and stroke The use of surrogate endpoints such as PFS and LDLC reduction in the absence of other measures of clinical benefit may not be sufficient for broad usage or approval even when such results are statistically significant Regulatory authorities could also add new requirements such as the completion of enrollment in a confirmatory study or the completion of an outcomes study or a meaningful portion of an outcomes study as conditions for obtaining approval or obtaining an indication For example despite demonstrating that Repatha  reduced LDLC levels in a broad patient population only after our large phase 3 outcomes study evaluating the ability of Repatha  to prevent CV events met certain of its primary composite endpoint and key secondary composite endpoint did the FDA grant a broader approval of Repatha  to reduce the risk of certain CV events and also to be used alone or in combination with other lipidlowering therapies for the treatment of adults with primary hyperlipidemia to reduce LDLC There may also be situations in which demonstrating the efficacy and safety of a product candidate may not be sufficient to gain regulatory approval unless superiority to other existing treatment options can be shown The imposition of additional requirements or our inability to meet them in a timely fashion or at all has delayed and may in the future delay our clinical development and regulatory filing efforts delay or prevent us from obtaining regulatory approval for new product candidates or new indications for existing products or prevent us from maintaining our current product labels 46 Some of our products have been approved by US and foreign regulatory authorities on an accelerated or conditional basis with full approval conditioned upon fulfilling the requirements of regulators For example in March 2018 we announced that the FDA approved BLINCYTO  under accelerated approval for the treatment of adults and children with Bcell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL in first or second complete remission with MRD greater than or equal to 01 percent Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials Regulatory authorities are placing greater focus on monitoring products originally approved on an accelerated or conditional basis and on whether the sponsors of such products have met the conditions of the accelerated or conditional approvals If we are unable to fulfill the regulators requirements that were conditions of a products accelerated or conditional approval andor if regulators reevaluate the data or riskbenefit profile of our product the conditional approval may not result in full approval or may be revoked or not renewed Alternatively we may be required to change the products labeled indications or even withdraw the product from the market Regulatory authorities can also impose postmarketing pediatric study requirements Failure to fulfill such requirements may result in regulatory or enforcement action including financial penalties or the invalidation of a products marketing authorization Safety problems or signals can arise as our products and product candidates are evaluated in clinical trials including investigator sponsored studies or as our marketed products are used in clinical practice We are required continuously to collect and assess adverse events reported to us and to communicate to regulatory agencies these adverse events and safety signals regarding our products Regulatory agencies periodically perform inspections of our pharmacovigilance processes including our adverse event reporting In the United States for our products with approved REMS see Item 1 BusinessGovernment RegulationPostapproval Phase we are required to submit periodic assessment reports to the FDA to demonstrate that the goals of the REMS are being met REMS and other risk management programs are designed to ensure that a drugs benefits outweigh the risks and vary in the elements they contain If the FDA is not satisfied with the results of the periodic assessment reports we submit for any of our REMS the FDA may also modify our REMS or take other regulatory actions such as implementing revised or restrictive labeling The drug delivery devices approved for use in combination with our products are also subject to regulatory oversight and review for safety and malfunctions See Some of our products are used with drug delivery or companion diagnostic devices that have their own regulatory manufacturing and other risks If regulatory agencies determine that we or other parties including our clinical trial investigators those operating our patient support programs or licensees of our products have not complied with the applicable reporting other pharmacovigilance or other safety or quality assessment requirements we may become subject to additional inspections warning letters or other enforcement actions including fines marketing authorization withdrawal and other penalties Our product candidates and marketed products can also be affected by safety problems or signals occurring with respect to products that are similar to ours or that implicate an entire class of products Further as a result of clinical trials including subanalyses or metaanalyses of earlier clinical trials a metaanalysis involves the use of various statistical methods to combine results from previous separate but related studies performed by us or others concerns may arise about the sufficiency of the data or studies underlying a products approved label Such actual or perceived safety problems or concerns can lead to  revised or restrictive labeling for our products or the potential for restrictive labeling that has resulted and may in the future result in our decision not to commercialize a product candidate  requirement of risk management or minimization activities or other regulatory agency compliance actions related to the promotion and sale of our products  postmarketing commitments mandated postmarketing requirements or pharmacovigilance programs for our approved products  product recalls of our approved products  required changes to the processes used in the manufacture of our products which could increase our manufacturing costs and affect the availability of contract manufacturers we may utilize to assist in such manufacturing  revocation of approval for our products from the market completely or within particular therapeutic areas or patient types  increased timelines or delays in being approved by the FDA or other regulatory bodies andor  treatments or product candidates not being approved by regulatory bodies 47 For example after an imbalance in positively adjudicated CV serious adverse events was observed in one of the phase 3 clinical trials for EVENITY  but not in another larger phase 3 study in April 2019 the FDA approved EVENITY  for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at high risk for fracture along with a postmarketing requirement The requirement includes a fiveyear observational feasibility study that could be followed by a comparative safety study or trial In addition to our innovative products we are working to develop and commercialize biosimilar versions of a number of products currently manufactured marketed and sold by other pharmaceutical companies In some markets there is not yet a legislative or regulatory pathway for the approval of biosimilars In the United States the BPCIA provided for such a pathway while the FDA continues to implement it discussions continue as to the evidence needed to demonstrate biosimilarity or interchangeability for specific products See We currently face competition from biosimilars and generics and expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars and generics in the future Delays or uncertainties in the development or implementation of such pathways could result in delays or difficulties in getting our biosimilar products approved by regulatory authorities subject us to unanticipated development costs or otherwise reduce the value of the investments we have made in the biosimilars area Further we cannot predict whether any repeal or reform of the ACA or other legislation or policy initiatives would affect the biosimilar pathway or have a material adverse effect on our development of biosimilars or on our marketed biosimilars In addition if we are unable to bring our biosimilar products to market on a timely basis and secure firsttomarket or other advantageous positions our future biosimilar sales business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected Some of our products are used with drug delivery or companion diagnostic devices that have their own regulatory manufacturing and other risks Many of our products and product candidates may be used in combination with a drug delivery device such as an injector or other delivery system For example Neulasta  is available as part of the Neulasta  Onpro  kit and our AutoTouch  reusable autoinjector is used with ENBREL Mini  singledose prefilled cartridges In addition some of our products or product candidates including many of our oncology product candidates including sotorasib may also require the use of a companion or other diagnostic device such as a device that determines whether the patient is eligible to use our drug or that helps ensure its safe and effective use In some regions including the United States regulatory authorities may require contemporaneous approval of the companion diagnostic device and the therapeutic product in others the regulatory authorities may require a separate study of the companion diagnostic device Our product candidates or expanded indications of our products used with such devices may not be approved or may be substantially delayed in receiving regulatory approval if development or approval of such devices is delayed such devices do not also gain or maintain regulatory approval or clearance or if such devices do not remain commercially available When approval of the product and device is sought under a single marketing drug application the increased complexity of the review process may delay receipt of regulatory approval In addition some of these devices may be provided by singlesource unaffiliated thirdparty companies We are dependent on the sustained cooperation and effort of those thirdparty companies to supply andor market the devices and in some cases to conduct the studies required for approval or clearance by the applicable regulatory agencies We are also dependent on those thirdparty companies continuing to meet applicable regulatory or other requirements Failure to successfully develop modify or supply the devices delays in or failures of the Amgen or thirdparty studies or failure of us or the thirdparty companies to obtain or maintain regulatory approval or clearance of the devices could result in increased development costs delays in or failure to obtain or maintain regulatory approval andor associated delays in a product candidate reaching the market or in the addition of new indications for existing products We are also required to collect and assess user complaints adverse events and malfunctions regarding our devices and actual or perceived safety problems or concerns with a device used with our product can lead to regulatory actions and adverse effects on our products See Our current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval  Additionally regulatory agencies conduct routine monitoring and inspections to identify and evaluate potential issues with our devices For example in 2017 the FDA reported on its adverse event reporting system that it was evaluating our Neulasta  Onpro  kit Subsequently we implemented device and labeling enhancements to address product complaints received on this device We continuously monitor complaints and adverse events and implement additional enhancements as needed Loss of regulatory approval or clearance of a device that is used with our product may also result in the removal of our product from the market Further failure to successfully develop supply or gain or maintain approval for these devices could adversely affect sales of the related approved products 48 Some of our pharmaceutical pipeline and our commercial product sales rely on collaborations with third parties which may adversely affect the development and sale of our products We depend on alliances with other companies including pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies vendors and service providers for the development of a portion of the products in our pharmaceutical pipeline and for the commercialization and sales of certain of our commercial products For example we have collaborations with third parties under which we share development rights obligations and costs andor commercial rights and obligations See Item 1 BusinessBusiness Relationships Failures by these parties to meet their contractual regulatory or other obligations to us or any disruption in the relationships between us and these third parties could have a material adverse effect on our pharmaceutical pipeline and business In addition our collaborative relationships for RD andor commercialization and sales often extend for many years and have given and may in the future give rise to disputes regarding the relative rights obligations and revenues of us and our collaboration partners including the ownership or prosecution of intellectual property and associated rights and obligations This could result in the loss of intellectual property rights or protection delay the development and sale of potential pharmaceutical products affect the effective sale and delivery of our commercialized products and lead to lengthy and expensive litigation administrative proceedings or arbitration For example we are currently involved in litigation with Novartis over our collaboration agreements for the development and commercialization of Aimovig   See Part IVNote 19 Contingencies and commitments to the Consolidated Financial Statements While our collaboration remains in place until the litigation is resolved and we remain committed to continuing to work with Novartis to sell and deliver Aimovig   it is possible that the dispute may nevertheless affect the efficiency of operation and future growth of the collaboration The litigation may also affect or delay or lead to a termination of other projects with Novartis Our efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies products or technology and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology we have acquired may not be successful and may result in unanticipated costs delays or failures to realize the benefits of the transactions We seek innovation through significant investment in both internal RD and external transactions including collaborations partnering alliances licenses joint ventures mergers and acquisitions collectively acquisition activity Acquisition activities may be subject to regulatory approvals or other requirements that are not within our control There can be no assurance that such regulatory or other approvals will be obtained or that all closing conditions required in connection with our acquisition activities will be satisfied or waived which could result in us being unable to complete the planned acquisition activities Acquisition activities are complex time consuming and expensive and may result in unanticipated costs delays or other operational or financial problems related to integrating the acquired company and business with our company which may divert our managements attention from other business issues and opportunities and restrict the full realization of the anticipated benefits of such transactions within the expected timeframe or at all We may pay substantial amounts of cash incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for acquisition activities which could adversely affect our liquidity or result in dilution to our stockholders respectively Further failures or difficulties in integrating or retaining new personnel or in integrating the operations of the businesses products or assets we acquire including related technology commercial operations compliance programs manufacturing distribution and general business operations and procedures may affect our ability to realize the benefits of the transaction and grow our business and may result in us incurring asset impairment or restructuring charges These and other challenges may arise in connection with our recent acquisition of Otezla  andor collaboration with BeiGene or with other acquisition activities which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and stock price RISKS RELATED TO OPERATIONS We perform a substantial majority of our commercial manufacturing activities at our facility in the US territory of Puerto Rico and a substantial majority of our clinical manufacturing activities at our facility in Thousand Oaks California significant disruptions or production failures at these facilities could significantly impair our ability to supply our products or continue our clinical trials The global supply of our products and product candidates for commercial sales and for use in our clinical trials is significantly dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of our manufacturing facilities in particular those in the US territory of Puerto Rico and Thousand Oaks California See Manufacturing difficulties disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales 49 We currently perform a substantial majority of our clinical manufacturing that supports our product candidates at our facility in Thousand Oaks California A substantial disruption in our ability to operate our Thousand Oaks manufacturing facility could materially and adversely affect our ability to supply our product candidates for use in our clinical trials leading to delays in development of our product candidates In addition we currently perform a substantial majority of our commercial manufacturing activities at our facility in the US territory of Puerto Rico In recent years Puerto Rico has been affected by natural disasters including droughts in mid2020 earthquakes in early 2020 and Hurricane Maria in 2017 These natural disasters have affected and may continue to affect public and private properties and Puerto Ricos electric grid and communications networks in the future While the critical manufacturing areas of our commercial manufacturing facility were not significantly affected by these natural disasters the restoration of electrical service on the island after Hurricane Maria was a slow process and our facility operated with electrical power from backup diesel powered generators for some time We also operated on backup generators for a few weeks after the early 2020 earthquakes in Puerto Rico Further instability of the electric grid could require us to increase the use of our generators or to continue using them exclusively In addition future storms earthquakes or other natural disasters or events could cause a more significant effect on our manufacturing operations Puerto Rico and the rest of the world are facing the effects of the COVID19 pandemic and the associated health and economic implications Since March2020 the Governor of Puerto Rico issued Executive Orders requiring the lockdown of businesses and government facilities imposing restrictions on business operations and a curfew on residents Our operations and employees have been exempted from the lockdown and curfew but we cannot predict how long these orders will continue in effect and what impact these orders and the COVID19 pandemic will have on our future operations and whether the Governor will issue future Executive Orders imposing stricter lockdown and curfew measures should COVID19 cases rise in Puerto Rico Although our ability to manufacture and supply our products has not to date been significantly affected by these natural disasters or the COVID19 pandemic a combination of these challenges or other issues that could give rise to any substantial disruption to our ability to operate our Puerto Rico manufacturing facility or get supplies and manufactured products transported to and from that location could materially and adversely affect our ability to supply our products and affect our product sales See Manufacturing difficulties disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales Hurricane Maria the earthquakes of early 2020 and the COVID19 pandemic have placed greater stress on the islands already challenged economy Beginning in 2016 the government of Puerto Rico defaulted on its roughly 72 billion in debt In response the US Congress passed the Puerto Rico Oversight Management and Economic Stability Act PROMESA which established a Financial Oversight and Management Board Oversight Board to provide fiscal oversight Title III of PROMESA provides Puerto Rico with a judicial process for restructuring its debt similar to but not identical to Chapter 9 of the US Bankruptcy Code including a stay of debtholder litigation In 2017 the Oversight Board approved and certified the filing in the US District Court for the District of Puerto Rico of a voluntary petition under Title III of PROMESA for the government of Puerto Rico and certain of its governmental entities including the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority which is currently undergoing a privatization process of its transmission and distribution infrastructure Under PROMESA other Title III filings for additional government entities may occur further complicating Puerto Ricos already uncertain fiscal stability In June 2019 in response to legal challenges the US Supreme Court ruled in favor of PROMESA and confirmed the constitutionality of the appointment process Each year since 2017 the Oversight Board has updated Puerto Ricos fiscal plans imposing significant expense reductions Each plan has stressed the need for fiscal and structural reforms to address Puerto Ricos challenging economic and demographic trends There is pending litigation between the Government of Puerto Rico and the Oversight Board with regards to the Oversight Boards powers under PROMESA and authority to review and prevent the enforcement of governmentapproved legislation This litigation currently underway in the Title III Court may impact how and when Puerto Rico will eventually restructure its debt and achieve fiscal and economic stability While the government and the Oversight Board have authorized emergency relief packages due to the COVID19 pandemic it is uncertain how or the degree to which the pandemic will impact Puerto Ricos fiscal and structural reforms and its economy In addition the 2017 Tax Act no longer permits deferral of US taxation on Puerto Rico earnings although these earnings generally will be taxed in the United States at a reduced rate Given Puerto Ricos challenged economy disaster recovery needs and impact from the COVID19 pandemic it may be difficult for Puerto Rico to sustain or grow its manufacturing base which contributes significantly to Puerto Ricos economy due to competition from other locations subject to similar levels of taxation 50 While PROMESA and the actions above continue to be important factors in moving Puerto Rico toward economic stability Puerto Ricos ongoing economic and demographic trend challenges and political situation the effects of natural disasters the COVID19 pandemic and the effects of the 2017 Tax Act or other potential tax law changes have negatively affected and may in the future negatively affect the territorial governments provision of utilities or other services in Puerto Rico that we use in the operation of our business and could create the potential for increased taxes or fees to operate in Puerto Rico result in a migration of workers from Puerto Rico to the mainland United States or make it more expensive or difficult for us to operate in Puerto Rico These factors could have a material adverse effect on our ability to supply our products on our business and on our product sales We rely on thirdparty suppliers for certain of our raw materials medical devices and components We rely on unaffiliated thirdparty suppliers for certain raw materials medical devices and components necessary for the manufacturing of our commercial and clinical products Certain of those raw materials medical devices and components are proprietary products of those unaffiliated thirdparty suppliers and are specifically cited in our drug applications with regulatory agencies so that they must be obtained from that specific sole source or sources and could not be obtained from another supplier unless and until the regulatory agency approved such supplier For example Scandinavian Health Limited Group is our single source of SureClick  autoinjectors for Repatha   ENBREL Aimovig   AMGEVITA TM and Aranesp   Also certain of the raw materials required in the commercial and clinical manufacturing of our products are sourced from other countries andor derived from biological sources including mammalian tissues bovine serum and human serum albumin Among the reasons we may be unable to obtain these raw materials medical devices and components include  regulatory requirements or action by regulatory agencies or others  adverse financial or other strategic developments at or affecting the supplier including bankruptcy  unexpected demand for or shortage of raw materials medical devices or components  failure to comply with our quality standards which results in quality and product failures product contamination andor recall  a material shortage contamination recall andor restrictions on the use of certain biologically derived substances or other raw materials  discovery of previously unknown or undetected imperfections in raw materials medical devices or components  cyberattacks on supplier systems and  labor disputes or shortages including from the effects of health emergencies such as novel viruses or pandemics such as the one we are currently experiencing with COVID19 and natural disasters For example in prior years we have experienced shortages in certain components necessary for the formulation fill and finish of certain of our products in our Puerto Rico facility Further quality issues that result in unexpected additional demand for certain components may lead to shortages of required raw materials or components such as we have experienced with EPOGEN  glass vials We may experience similar or other shortages in the future resulting in delayed shipments supply constraints clinical trial delays contract disputes andor stockouts of our products These or other similar events could negatively affect our ability to satisfy demand for our products or conduct clinical trials which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales business and results of operations Manufacturing difficulties disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales Manufacturing biologic and small molecule human therapeutic products is difficult complex and highly regulated We manufacture many of our commercial products and product candidates internally In addition we currently use thirdparty contract manufacturers to produce or assist in the production of a number of our products and we currently use contract manufacturers to produce or assist in the production of a number of our latestage product candidates and drug delivery devices See Item 1 BusinessManufacturing Distribution and Raw MaterialsManufacturing Our ability to adequately and timely manufacture and supply our products and product candidates to support our clinical trials is dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of our facilities and those of our thirdparty contract manufacturers which may be affected by  capacity of manufacturing facilities  contamination by microorganisms or viruses or foreign particles from the manufacturing process 51  natural or other disasters including hurricanes earthquakes volcanoes or fires  labor disputes or shortages including the effects of health emergencies such as novel viruses or pandemics such as the one we are currently experiencing with COVID19 or natural disasters  compliance with regulatory requirements  changes in forecasts of future demand  timing and actual number of production runs and production success rates and yields  updates of manufacturing specifications  contractual disputes with our suppliers and contract manufacturers  timing and outcome of product quality testing  power failures andor other utility failures  cyberattacks on supplier systems  breakdown failure substandard performance or improper installation or operation of equipment including our information technology systems and networkconnected control systems or those of our contract manufacturers or thirdparty service providers andor  delays in the ability of the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies to provide us necessary reviews inspections and approvals including as a result of a subsequent extended US federal or other government shutdowns If any of these or other problems affect production in one or more of our facilities or those of our thirdparty contract manufacturers or if we do not accurately forecast demand for our products or the amount of our product candidates required in clinical trials we may be unable to start or increase production in our unaffected facilities to meet demand If the efficient manufacture and supply of our products or product candidates is interrupted we may experience delayed shipments delays in our clinical trials supply constraints stockouts adverse event trends contract disputes andor recalls of our products From time to time we have initiated recalls of certain lots of our products For example in July 2014 we initiated a voluntary recall of an Aranesp  lot distributed in the EU after particles were detected in a quality control sample following distribution of that lot and in April 2018 we initiated a precautionary recall of two batches of Vectibix  distributed in Switzerland after potential crimping defects were discovered in the metal seals on some product vials If we are at any time unable to provide an uninterrupted supply of our products to patients we may lose patients and physicians may elect to prescribe competing therapeutics instead of our products which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales business and results of operations Our manufacturing processes those of our thirdparty contract manufacturers and those of certain of our thirdparty service providers must undergo regulatory approval processes and are subject to continued review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities It can take longer than five years to build validate and license another manufacturing plant and it can take longer than three years to qualify and license a new contract manufacturer or service provider If we elect or are required to make changes to our manufacturing processes because of new regulatory requirements new interpretations of existing requirements or other reasons this could increase our manufacturing costs and result in delayed shipments delays in our clinical trials supply constraints stockouts adverse event trends or contract negotiations or disputes Such manufacturing challenges may also occur if our existing contract manufacturers are unable or unwilling to timely implement such changes or at all 52 In addition regulatory agencies conduct routine monitoring and conduct inspections of our manufacturing facilities and processes as well as those of our thirdparty contract manufacturers and service providers If regulatory authorities determine that we or our thirdparty contract manufacturers or certain of our thirdparty service providers have violated regulations they may mandate corrective actions andor issue warning letters or even restrict suspend or revoke our prior approvals prohibiting us from manufacturing our products or conducting clinical trials or selling our marketed products until we or the affected thirdparty contract manufacturers or thirdparty service providers comply or indefinitely See also Our current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval Such issues may also delay the approval of product candidates we have submitted for regulatory review even if such product candidates are not directly related to the products devices or processes at issue with regulators Because our thirdparty contract manufacturers and certain of our thirdparty service providers are subject to the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities alternative qualified thirdparty contract manufacturers and thirdparty service providers may not be available on a timely basis or at all If we or our thirdparty contract manufacturers or thirdparty service providers cease or interrupt production or if our thirdparty contract manufacturers and thirdparty service providers fail to supply materials products or services to us we may experience delayed shipments delays in our clinical trials supply constraints contract disputes stockouts andor recalls of our products Additionally we distribute a substantial volume of our commercial products through our primary distribution centers in Louisville Kentucky for the United States and in Breda Netherlands for Europe and much of the rest of the world We also conduct most of the labeling and packaging of our products distributed in Europe and much of the rest of the world in Breda Our ability to timely supply products is dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operations of our distribution and logistics centers our thirdparty logistics providers and our labeling and packaging facility in Breda Further we rely on commercial transportation including air and sea freight for the distribution of our products to our customers which may be negatively affected by natural disasters security threats andor the ongoing COVID19 pandemic There have also been legislative and administrative proposals seeking to incentivize greater drug manufacturing in the United States with the stated goal of improving supply reliability in the United States For example on August 6 2020 the previous Administration issued an Executive Order aimed at boosting domestic production of essential medicines medical countermeasures and critical inputs titled Executive Order on Ensuring Essential Medicines Medical Countermeasures and Critical Inputs are Made in the United States Additionally one legislative proposal would prohibit the US Department of Veterans Affairs from purchasing certain drugs that have active pharmaceutical ingredients manufactured outside the United States While we perform a substantial majority of our commercial manufacturing activities in the United States including in the US territory of Puerto Rico and a substantial majority of our clinical manufacturing activities at our facility in Thousand Oaks California the passage of such legislation could result in foreign governments enacting retaliatory legislation or regulatory actions which may have an adverse effect on our product sales business and results of operations GENERAL RISK FACTORS Global economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business Our operations and performance have been and may continue to be affected by global economic conditions The economic downturn resulting from the COVID19 pandemic has precipitated a global recession which may be of an extended duration Additionally financial pressures may cause government or other thirdparty payers to more aggressively seek cost containment measures See Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from thirdparty payers and pricing and reimbursement pressures may affect our profitability  As a result of global economic conditions some thirdparty payers may delay or be unable to satisfy their reimbursement obligations Job losses or other economic hardships may also affect patients ability to afford health care as a result of increased copay or deductible obligations greater cost sensitivity to existing copay or deductible obligations lost healthcare insurance coverage or for other reasons We believe such conditions have led and could continue to lead to reduced demand for our products which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales business and results of operations Economic conditions may also adversely affect the ability of our distributors customers and suppliers to obtain the liquidity required to buy inventory or raw materials and to perform their obligations under agreements with us which could disrupt our operations Although we monitor our distributors customers and suppliers financial condition and their liquidity to mitigate our business risks some of our distributors customers and suppliers may become insolvent which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales business and results of operations A significant worsening of global economic conditions could materially increase these risks facing us We maintain a significant portfolio of investments disclosed as cash equivalents and marketable securities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets The global spread of COVID19 has also led to disruption and volatility in the global capital markets We have certain assets including equity investments that are exposed to market fluctuations that could in a sustained or recurrent series of market disruptions result in impairments The value of our investments may also be adversely affected by interest rate fluctuations downgrades in credit ratings illiquidity in the capital markets and other factors that may result in otherthantemporary declines in the value of our investments Any of those events could cause us to record impairment charges with respect to our investment portfolio or to realize losses on sales of investments 53 Our stock price is volatile Our stock price like that of our peers in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries is volatile Our revenues and operating results may fluctuate from period to period for a number of reasons Events such as a delay in product development changes to our expectations or strategy or even a relatively small revenue shortfall may cause financial results for a period to be below our expectations or projections As a result our revenues and operating results and in turn our stock price may be subject to significant fluctuations Announcements or discussions including via social media channels of possible restrictive actions by government or private payers that would negatively affect our business or industry if ultimately enacted or adopted may also cause our stock price to fluctuate whether or not such restrictive actions ever actually occur Similarly actual or perceived safety issues with our products or similar products or unexpected clinical trial results can have an immediate and rapid effect on our stock price whether or not our operating results are materially affected We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us or at all The capital and credit markets may experience extreme volatility and disruption which may lead to uncertainty and liquidity issues for both borrowers and investors For example early in 2020 there were significant disruptions in the commercial paper market and several borrowers were unable to obtain funding at normal rates or maturities which resulted in a significant increase in draws of corporate credit lines with banks Similarly the bond markets experienced extreme volatility in terms of interest rates and credit spreads with several days without new issuances of corporate bonds We expect to access the capital markets from time to time to supplement our existing funds and cash generated from operations in satisfying our needs for working capital capital expenditure and debt service requirements our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock and other business initiatives we strategically plan to pursue including acquisitions and licensing activities In the event of adverse capital and credit market conditions we may be unable to obtain capital market financing on similar favorable terms or at all which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations Changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized creditrating agencies could adversely affect our ability to obtain capital market financing and the cost of such financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities Item 1B UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None 54 Item 2
