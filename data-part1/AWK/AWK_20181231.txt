PART I ITEM 1 BUSINESS Our Company With a history dating back to 1886  American Water is the largest and most geographically diverse publiclytraded water and wastewater utility company in the United States as measured by both operating revenues and population served A holding company originally incorporated in Delaware in 1936  we employ approximately 7100 professionals who provide drinking water wastewater and other related services to more than 14 million people in 46 states and Ontario Canada We conduct the majority of our business through regulated utilities that provide water and wastewater services collectively presented as our  Regulated Businesses  We also operate marketbased businesses that provide a broad range of related and complementary water wastewater and other services Individually these businesses do not meet the criteria of a reportable segment in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States GAAP and are collectively presented as our MarketBased Businesses  which is consistent with how management assesses the results of these businesses Throughout this Form 10K unless the context otherwise requires references to we us our the Company and American Water mean American Water Works Company Inc and its subsidiaries taken together as a whole References to parent company mean American Water Works Company Inc without its subsidiaries Regulated Businesses Our primary business involves the ownership of utilities that provide water and wastewater services to residential commercial industrial public authority fire service and sale for resale customers Our utilities operate in approximately 1600 communities in 16 states in the United States with approximately 34 million active customers to our water and wastewater networks Services provided by our utilities are generally subject to economic regulation by certain state utility commissions or other entities engaged in utility regulation collectively referred to as Public Utility Commissions PUCs or Regulators Certain federal state and local governments also regulate environmental health and safety and water quality matters We report the results of the services provided by our utilities in our Regulated Businesses segment Operating revenues for our Regulated Businesses were 2984 million for 2018  2958 million for 2017 and 2871 million for 2016  accounting for 87  88 and 87  respectively of the Companys total operating revenues for the same periods The following table provides a geographic summary of our Regulated Businesses  operating

additional information 3 Table of Contents Customers Our Regulated Businesses have a large and geographically diverse customer base A customer is defined as a person business municipality or any other entity that purchases our water or wastewater services as of the last business day of a reporting period One single customer may purchase our services for use by multiple individuals or businesses as is the case in many homes apartment complexes businesses and governmental entities The vast majority of our regulated water customers are metered which allows us to measure and bill for our customers water usage typically on a monthly basis We employ a variety of methods of customer meter reading to monitor consumption These methods range from meters with mechanical registers where consumption is manually recorded by meter readers to meters with electronic registers capable of transmitting consumption data to proximity devices or via radio frequency to mobile or fixed network data collectors Our wastewater customers are billed either a flat rate or based upon their water consumption Residential customers make up a substantial portion of our customer base in all of the states in which we operate We also serve i commercial customers such as food and beverage providers commercial property developers and proprietors and energy suppliers ii fire service customers where we supply water through our distribution systems to public fire hydrants for firefighting purposes and to private fire customers for use in fire suppression systems in office buildings and other facilities iii industrial customers such as largescale manufacturers mining and production operations iv public authorities such as government buildings and other public sector facilities including schools and universities and v other utilities and community water and wastewater systems in the form of bulk contracts for the supply of water or the treatment of wastewater for their own customers The following chart depicts the allocation of our Regulated Businesses  operating revenue by type including a breakout of the total water services revenues by class of customer for the year ended December 31 2018  a Includes water revenues from public authorities and other utilities and community water systems under bulk contracts b Includes other operating revenues consisting primarily of miscellaneous utility

table above generally result in service to multiple customers Customer growth in our Regulated Businesses is primarily from i adding new customers to our customer base through acquisitions of water andor wastewater utility systems ii organic population growth in our authorized service areas and iii sale of water to other water utilities and community water systems Capital Investment The aging water and wastewater infrastructure in the United States is in need of replacement and modernization The American Society of Civil Engineers published its Report Card for Americas Infrastructure in 2017 and gave the drinking water industry a grade of D and the wastewater infrastructure a grade of D primarily because much of the countrys infrastructure is nearing the end of its useful life The report also stated that on an annual basis approximately 2 trillion gallons of treated water are lost in the United States through more than 240000 main breaks at an estimated cost of 26 billion  This represents approximately 20 of all treated water in the country In addition approximately 900 billion gallons of untreated sewage is discharged into the countrys rivers and streams every year As documented in the American Water Works Associations Buried No Longer Confronting Americas Water Infrastructure Challenge  restoring the countrys existing water systems as they reach the end of their useful lives and expanding them to serve a growing population will cost at least 1 trillion between 2011 and 2035 just to maintain the current levels of water service In addition increased regulation related to water quality and the management of water and wastewater residual discharges which began with the passage of the Clean Water Act in 1972 and the Safe Drinking Water Act in 1974 is also a primary driver for the need to modernize the countrys water and wastewater infrastructure To address the growing infrastructure needs in the areas we serve we plan to invest 73 billion over the next five years including 16 billion in 2019 for capital improvements to our Regulated Businesses water and wastewater infrastructure largely for pipe replacement and upgrading aging water and wastewater treatment facilities We have proactively improved our pipe renewal rate from a 250year replacement cycle to a 120year replacement cycle which we anticipate will enable us to replace nearly 2000 miles of mains and collection pipes between 2019 and 2023 In addition during this same fiveyear period our capital investment in treatment plants storage tanks and other key aboveground facilities has increased over 10 further addressing infrastructure renewal resiliency water quality operational efficiency technology and innovation and emerging regulatory compliance needs Additionally we are investing significantly in resiliency projects to address the impacts of climate and weather variability by hardening our assets Economic Regulation and Rate Making Our Regulated Businesses operate under a regulatory compact whereby in exchange for exclusive rights to provide water and wastewater services in defined service territories we have an obligation to serve customers within those territories requesting service within reasonable limits In return for agreeing to invest capital into our water and wastewater systems we are given the opportunity to recover our costs of doing business and earn a reasonable rate of return on our investments The operations of our Regulated Businesses are generally subject to economic regulation by PUCs in the state in which they operate with the primary responsibility of the PUCs to promote the overall public interest by balancing the interest of customers and utility investors Specific authority might differ from state to state but in most states PUCs review and approve rates charged to customers accounting treatments longterm financing programs and cost of capital OM expenses capital expenditures taxes affiliated transactions and relationships reorganizations and mergers and acquisitions along with imposing certain penalties or granting certain incentives Regulatory policies vary from state to state and could potentially change over time These policies will affect the timing as well as the extent of recovery of expenses and the realized return on invested capital 5 Table of Contents The process to obtain approval for a change in rates generally occurs by way of a rate case filed by the utility with the PUC on a periodic basis The timing of rate case filings is typically determined by either periodic requirements in the regulatory jurisdiction or by the utilitys need to increase its revenue requirement to recover capital investment costs changes in operating revenues operating costs or other market conditions Our rate case management program is guided by the principles of i obtaining timely recovery of capital investment costs ii recognizing declining sales resulting from reduced consumption and iii obtaining appropriate recovery of utility OM costs including costs incurred for compliance with environmental regulations The program attempts to minimize regulatory lag which is the time between the occurrence of an event that triggers a change in the utilitys revenue requirement and its recognition in rates For example regulatory lag describes the time between when a capital investment is placed into service for the benefit of the customer and when the Company can begin earning a return of and on that capital investment through the ratemaking process It also applies to the lag in the recognition in rate recovery of changes in expenses and revenues Our Regulated Businesses support regulatory practices at the PUCs and state legislatures that mitigate the adverse impact of regulatory lag The following table provides examples of approved regulatory practices Regulatory Practices Description States Allowed Infrastructure replacement surcharges Allows rates to change periodically outside a general rate case proceeding to reflect recovery of capital investments made to replace infrastructure necessary to sustain safe reliable services for our customers These mechanisms typically involve periodic filings and reviews to ensure transparency IA IL IN MO NJ NY PA TN VA WV Future test year A test period used for setting rates which begins with the date new rates are effective This allows current or projected revenues expenses and capital investments to be collected on a timelier basis CA HI IA IL IN KY NY PA TN VA Hybrid test year Allows an update to historical data for known and measurable changes that occur subsequent to the historical test year MD MO NJ WV Utility plant recovery mechanisms Allows recovery of the full return on utility plant costs during the construction period instead of capitalizing an allowance for funds used during construction In addition some states allow the utility to seek preapproval of certain capital projects and associated costs In this preapproval process the PUC may assess the prudency of such projects CA IL KY NY PA TN VA Expense mechanisms Allows changes in certain operating expenses which may fluctuate based on conditions beyond the utilitys control to be recovered outside of a general rate case proceeding or deferred until the next general rate case proceeding CA IL MD MO NJ NY PA TN VA Revenue stability mechanisms Separates a utilitys cost recovery from the amount of water it sells to recover its fixed costs and ongoing infrastructure investment needs Such a mechanism adjusts rates periodically to ensure that a utilitys revenue will be sufficient to cover its costs regardless of sales volume including recognition of declining sales resulting from reduced consumption while providing an incentive for customers to use water more efficiently CA IL NY Consolidated tariffs Use of a unified rate structure for water systems owned and operated by a single utility which may or may not be physically interconnected The consolidated tariff pricing structure may be used fully or partially in a state and is generally used to prioritize capital investments and moderate the impact of periodic fluctuations in local costs while lowering administrative costs for customers Pennsylvania also permits a blending of water and wastewater revenue requirements CA IA IL IN KY MD MO NJ NY PA VA WV We pursue or seek enhancement to these regulatory practices to facilitate efficient recovery of our costs and capital investments in order to continue to provide safe clean reliable and affordable services to our customers The ability to seek regulatory treatment as described above does not guarantee that the PUCs will accept our proposal in the context of a particular rate case and these regulatory practices may reduce but not eliminate regulatory lag associated with traditional rate making processes It is also our strategy to expand their use in areas where they may not currently apply Acquisitions and Strategic Growth The US water and wastewater industries include investorowned systems as well as municipal systems that are owned and operated by local governments or governmental subdivisions Both industries are highly fragmented According to the US Environmental Protection Agency EPA approximately 84 of the water market is served by municipal systems and approximately 98 of the countrys wastewater systems are government owned The EPA also estimates that there are approximately 50000 community water systems and approximately 15000 community wastewater systems in the United States with approximately 80 of the community water systems serving a population of 3000 or less This large number of relatively small fragmented water and wastewater systems may result in inefficiencies in the marketplace since such utilities may not have the operating expertise financial and technological capability or economies of scale to provide services or raise capital as efficiently as larger utilities Larger utilities that have greater access to capital are generally more capable of making mandated and other necessary infrastructure upgrades to their water and wastewater systems In addition water and wastewater utilities with large customer bases spread across broad geographic regions may more easily absorb the impact of significant variations in precipitation and temperatures such as droughts excessive rain and cool or warm temperatures in specific areas Larger utilities generally are able to spread support services over a larger customer base thereby reducing the costs to serve each customer Since many administrative and support activities can be efficiently centralized to gain economies of scale companies that participate in industry consolidation have the potential to improve operating efficiencies lower costs per unit and improve service at the same time Larger utilities also typically have the expertise to operate systems more efficiently and can attract and retain employees needed to operate the utility over time 6 Table of Contents A fundamental aspect of our growth strategy is to pursue acquisitions of small and medium water andor wastewater systems of between 3000 and 30000 customers in geographic proximity to areas where we operate our Regulated Businesses  The proximity of acquisition opportunities to our regulated footprint allows us to integrate and manage the acquired systems and operations primarily using our existing management although we typically retain the majority of employees and to achieve operational efficiencies and prioritize capital investment needs Our current customer mix of 94 water and 6 wastewater also presents strategic opportunities for wastewater growth and systems consolidation allowing us to add wastewater customers where we already serve water customers We intend to continue to expand our regulated footprint geographically by acquiring water and wastewater systems in our existing markets and if appropriate pursuing acquisition opportunities in certain domestic markets where we do not currently operate our Regulated Businesses  Before entering new regulated markets we will evaluate the business and regulatory climates to ensure that we will have the opportunity to achieve an appropriate rate of return on our investment while maintaining our high standards for providing safe reliable and affordable services to our customers as well as a line of sight to grow our base customers to attain efficiencies after entering the new domestic market Increasingly stringent environmental health and safety and water quality regulations the amount of infrastructure in need of significant capital investment financial challenges and industry legislation are several elements that may drive more municipalities to consider selling their water and wastewater assets We are an experienced utility with proven access to capital and financial technical and managerial resources with public service commission oversight We are a solution provider and believe that many communities could benefit from receiving safe and reliable water and wastewater service Industry Legislation In 2017 New Jersey enacted the Water Quality Accountability Act the WQAA which sets new operational standards for all water utilities in New Jersey including municipal and investorowned utilities with more than 500 service connections This law imposes new requirements in areas such as cybersecurity asset management water quality reporting remediation of notices of violation and hydrant and valve maintenance The WQAA requires the most senior water manager or either the executive director for municipal utility authorities or the mayor or chief executive officer for municipally owned public water systems to certify that the system meets the requirements under the WQAA On October 19 2018 our New Jersey American Water subsidiary certified that it was in compliance with all aspects of the Act In 2018 similar legislation was passed in Indiana which sets new operational standards and requirements for water and wastewater treatment plants in areas such as capital asset management costbenefit analysis and cybersecurity Also in 2018 President Trump signed Americas Water Infrastructure Act of 2018 The legislation includes policies intended to improve water and wastewater system management and authorization for states to assess options for consolidation for systems that do not comply with the federal Safe Drinking Water Act and its rules and regulations The legislation increases funding to water system funding programs including the State Revolving Loan Fund program and the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act Our regulated subsidiaries in California Illinois Indiana Iowa Maryland Missouri New Jersey and Pennsylvania have access to fair market value legislation for private sector investment in public sector systems We support full optionality for municipalities including state legislation that enables the consolidation of the largely fragmented water and wastewater industries through thirdparty fair market valuations of purchased property Fair market value assessment of water and wastewater systems is an alternative to the traditional depreciated original cost method of valuation providing municipalities with a purchase price that is reflective of the assets value while the utility has increased assurance of recovering the purchase price over the life of the assets subject to state regulatory commission approval Consolidated tariffs use a unified rate structure for systems owned and operated by a single utility which may or may not be physically interconnected Consolidated tariff pricing moderates the impact of periodic fluctuations in local costs and promotes a more universal water infrastructure investment in the state As a result consolidated tariffs can make it easier to incorporate new systems into an existing utility and can ensure economies of scale for even the smallest of systems and prioritize capital needs across the state Overall this brings costeffective higher quality services to a larger number of citizens Eleven of our regulated subsidiaries currently have some form of consolidated tariff pricing including Illinois Indiana Iowa Kentucky Maryland Missouri New Jersey New York Pennsylvania Virginia and West Virginia 7 Table of Contents In 2018 legislation was passed in our Missouri and California subsidiaries changing the public vote requirement for the sale of water or wastewater systems In Missouri the public vote requirement for the sale of a municipal water or wastewater system changed to a simple majority for more than 500 small towns Historically only larger communities required a simple majority while smaller communities needed a twothirds majority This legislation increases the options for small towns should they decide to address their water and sewer challenges through an asset sale In California the vote required to allow cities to sell sewer systems changed to a simple majority as compared to a twothirds majority Competition In our Regulated Businesses  we generally do not face direct competition in our existing markets because i we operate in those markets pursuant to franchises charters certificates of public convenience and necessity or similar authorizations collectively CPCNs issued by state PUCs and ii the high cost of constructing a new water and wastewater system in an existing market creates a high barrier to market entry However our Regulated Businesses do face competition from governmental agencies other investorowned utilities large industrial customers with the ability to provide their own water supplytreatment process and strategic buyers that are entering new markets andor making strategic acquisitions When pursuing acquisitions our largest investorowned competitors based on a comparison of operating revenues and population served are Aqua America Inc Suez North America American States Water Company and California Water Service Group From time to time we also face competition from infrastructure funds multiutility companies and others such as Algonquin Power and Utilities Corp Eversource Energy and Corix Condemnation and Eminent Domain All or portions of our Regulated Businesses  utility assets could be acquired by state municipal or other government entities through one or more of the following methods i eminent domain also known as condemnation ii the right of purchase given or reserved by a municipality or political subdivision when the original CPCN was granted and iii the right of purchase given or reserved under the law of the state in which the utility subsidiary was incorporated or from which it received its CPCN The acquisition consideration related to such a proceeding initiated by a local government may be determined consistent with applicable eminent domain law or may be negotiated or fixed by appraisers as prescribed by the law of the state or in the particular CPCN As such we are periodically subject to condemnation proceedings in the ordinary course of business For example a citizens group in Monterey California successfully added Measure J to the November 6 2018 election ballot asking voters to decide whether the Monterey Peninsula Water Management District the MPWMD should conduct a feasibility study concerning the potential purchase of our California subsidiarys Monterey water service assets and if feasible to proceed with a purchase of those assets without an additional public vote This service territory represents approximately 40000 customers On November 27 2018 Measure J was certified to have passed The MPWMD has until August 27 2019 to complete a feasibility study and submit to its board a written plan for acquiring the system assets If the MPWMD were to determine that such an acquisition is feasible then the MPWMD would commence a multiyear eminent domain proceeding against our California subsidiary to first establish the MPWMDs right to take the system assets and if such right is established determine the amount of just compensation to be paid for the system assets Also five municipalities in the Chicago Illinois area approximately 30300 customers in total formed a water agency and filed an eminent domain lawsuit against our Illinois subsidiary in January 2013 seeking to condemn the water pipeline that serves those five municipalities Before filing its eminent domain lawsuit the water agency made an offer of 38 million for the pipeline A jury trial will take place to establish the value of the pipeline Although the date of this trial has not currently been scheduled it is likely to commence in the fourth quarter of 2019 Furthermore the law in certain jurisdictions in which our Regulated Businesses operate provides for eminent domain rights allowing private property owners to file a lawsuit to seek just compensation against a public utility if a public utilitys infrastructure has been determined to be a substantial cause of damage to that property In these actions the plaintiff would not have to prove that the public utility acted negligently In California most recently lawsuits have been filed in connection with largescale natural events such as wildfires Some have included allegations that infrastructure of certain utilities triggered the natural event that resulted in damage to the property In some cases the PUC has allowed certain costs or losses incurred by the utility to be recovered from customers in rates but in other cases such recovery in rates has been disallowed Also the utility may have obtained insurance that could respond to some or all of such losses although the utility would be at risk for any losses not ultimately subject to rate or insurance recovery or losses that exceed the limits of such insurance 8 Table of Contents Water Supply and Wastewater Services Our Regulated Businesses generally own the physical assets used to store pump treat and deliver water to our customers and collect treat transport and recycle wastewater Typically we do not own the water itself which is held in public trust and is allocated to us through contracts permits and allocation rights granted by federal and state or multistate agencies or through the ownership of water rights pursuant to local law We are dependent on defined sources of water supply and obtain our water supply from surface water sources such as reservoirs lakes rivers and streams from groundwater sources such as wells and aquifers and water purchased from thirdparty water suppliers The level of water treatment we apply varies significantly depending upon the quality of the water source and customer stipulations Surface water sources typically generally require significant treatment while groundwater sources often require chemical treatment only The following chart depicts our sources of water supply as of December 31 2018  The following table provides percentages of water supply by source type for our top seven states for 2018 were as follows Surface Water Ground Water Purchased Water New Jersey 71 24 5 Pennsylvania 91 7 2 Missouri 79 20 1 Illinois 53 36 11 California  64 36 Indiana 44 56  West Virginia 99  1 Our ability to meet the existing and future water demands of our customers depends on an adequate water supply Drought governmental restrictions overuse of sources of water the protection of threatened species or habitats contamination or other factors may limit the availability of ground and surface water We employ a variety of measures in an effort to obtain adequate sources of water supply both in the shortterm and over the longterm The geographic diversity of our service areas may mitigate some of the economic effects on the water supply associated with weather extremes we might encounter in any particular service territory For example in any given summer some areas may experience drier than average weather which may reduce the amount of source water available while other areas we serve may experience wetter than average weather 9 Table of Contents In our longterm planning we evaluate quality quantity growth needs and alternate sources of water supply as well as transmission and distribution capacity Water supply is seasonal in nature and weather conditions can have a pronounced effect on supply In order to ensure that we have adequate water supply we use longterm planning processes and maintain contingency plans to minimize the potential impact on service caused by climate variability and a wide range of weather fluctuations In connection with supply planning for most surface or groundwater sources we employ models to determine safe yields under different rainfall and drought conditions Surface and ground water levels are routinely monitored so that supply capacity deficits may to the extent possible be predicted and mitigated through demand management and additional supply development An example of our use of longterm planning to ensure that we have adequate water supply is our involvement in the Monterey Peninsula Water Supply Project the Water Supply Project in California The Water Supply Project includes the construction of a desalination plant owned by our California subsidiary and the construction of wells that would supply water to the desalination plant In addition the Water Supply Project also includes our California subsidiarys purchase of water from a groundwater replenishment project between the Monterey Regional Water Pollution Control Agency now known as Monterey One Water and the MPWMD The Water Supply Project is intended among other things to fulfill obligations of our California subsidiary to eliminate unauthorized diversions from the Carmel River as required under orders of the California State Water Resources Control Board the SWRCB For more information see Item 3Legal Proceedings Alternative Water Supply in Lieu of Carmel River Diversions Wastewater services involve the collection of wastewater from customers premises through sewer lines The wastewater is then transported through a sewer network to a treatment facility where it is treated to meet required regulatory standards for wastewater before being returned to the environment The solid waste byproduct of the treatment process is disposed of or recycled in accordance with applicable standards and regulations Seasonality Customer demand for our water service is affected by weather and tends to vary with temperature rainfall levels and the frequency of rainfall Customer demand is generally greater during the warmer months primarily due to increased water usage for irrigation systems and other outdoor water use As such we typically expect our operating revenues to be the highest in the third quarter of each year Weather that is hotter and drier than average generally increases operating revenues whereas weather that is cooler andor wetter than average generally serves to suppress customer water demand and can reduce water operating revenues Three of our jurisdictions California Illinois and New York have adopted revenue stability mechanisms which permit us to collect state PUCauthorized revenue for a given period which is not tied to the volume of water sold during that period thereby lessening the impact of weather variability See  Economic Regulation and Rate Making  for additional information regarding revenue stability mechanisms MarketBased Businesses Through our MarketBased Businesses  we provide a broad range of related and complementary water and wastewater services primarily to residential and smaller commercial customers the US government on military installations and shale natural gas exploration and production companies as well as municipalities utilities and industrial customers These businesses are not subject to economic regulation by state PUCs and the services provided generally do not require significant capital investment Operating revenues for our MarketBased Businesses were 476 million for 2018  422 million for 2017 and 451 million for 2016  accounting for 14  13 and 14  respectively of the Companys total operating revenues for the same periods Our primary MarketBased Businesses include the following operating segments  Homeowner Services Group  which provides various warranty protection programs to residential and smaller commercial customers  Military Services Group  which enters into longterm contracts with the US government to provide water and wastewater services on various military installations and  Keystone Clearwater Solutions LLC Keystone which provides customized water transfer services for shale natural gas exploration and production companies We also enter into contracts with municipal commercial and industrial customers to operate and manage water and wastewater facilities and provide other related services through our Contract Services Group  During 2018 we closed on the sale of the majority of our Contract Services Group s OM contracts to subsidiaries of Veolia Environnement SA See Note 4Acquisitions and Divestitures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information We will retain four of our Contract Services Group s OM contracts due to their proximity to our existing service areas and expect the majority of the remaining contracts to be sold to other parties or expire within the next twelve months 10 Table of Contents Homeowner Services Group Our Homeowner Services Group  which includes our June 4 2018 acquisition of Pivotal Home Solutions Pivotal provides warranty protection programs to residential and smaller commercial customers to protect against repair costs for interior and exterior water and sewer lines interior gas and electric lines heating and cooling systems water heaters and other home appliances as well as power surge protection and other related services We also develop partnerships with municipalities utilities and other organizations to offer our protection programs to customers serviced by or affiliated with those municipalities utilities and organizations The term of these partnership agreements is typically three to five years with mutual optional renewals As of December 31 2018  our Homeowner Services Group had approximately 3 million customer contracts in 43 states and 26 partnership agreements with utilities municipalities and other organizations Military Services Group Our Military Services Group operates on 14 military installations under 50year contracts with the US government as part of its Utility Privatization Program The scope of these contracts generally includes the operation and maintenance of the installations water and wastewater systems and a capital program focused on asset replacement and in certain instances systems expansion The replacement of assets assumed when a contract is awarded to the Company is funded from the contract fee At times new assets are required to support the installations mission and the construction of these assets are funded by the US government as separate modifications or amendments to the contract The capital program historically has not used the Companys equity or debt borrowings rather we have used limited working capital for shortterm needs under these contracts In April 2018 the US Army instituted a requirement that a bidder must offer financing in its proposal for a new capital project The Company is currently exploring strategies to address the US Armys revised requirements for new projects on which it may seek to bid including partnering with third parties for offbalance sheet financing The contract price for nine of our contracts with the US government is subject to redetermination two years after commencement of operations and every three years thereafter Price redetermination is a contract mechanism to periodically adjust the service fee in the next period to reflect changes in contract obligations and anticipated market conditions The remaining five contracts with the US government are subject to annual price adjustments under a mechanism similar to price redetermination called Economic Price Adjustment All of these contracts may be terminated in whole or in part prior to the end of the 50year term for convenience of the US government or as a result of default or nonperformance by the subsidiary performing the contract In either event pursuant to termination provisions applicable to these contracts we would be entitled to recover allowable costs that we may have incurred under the contract plus the contract profit margin on incurred costs Our backlog of revenue associated with our contracts with the US government is approximately 43 billion  with an average remaining contract term of 42 years Keystone In July 2015 we acquired a 95 interest in Water Solutions Holdings LLC including its wholly owned subsidiary Keystone During 2018 pursuant to the exercise of put options by the minority owners we acquired the remaining 5 interest in Keystone bringing our ownership interest to 100  Keystone is a water service and management solutions company that serves shale natural gas exploration and production customers in the Appalachian Basin During 2018 Keystone exited its construction and water trucking business lines narrowing the scope of its business going forward to customized water transfer services Keystone operates under master service agreements that are generally shorter term in nature When the initial term of these agreements expire they typically renew automatically on an annual basis and are generally cancelable by either party with 30 days prior notice As of December 31 2018  Keystone serves approximately 47 customers Competition We face competition in our MarketBased Businesses from a number of service providers including HomeServe USA in our Homeowner Services Group  and American States Water Company Suez North America and Veolia Environnement SA in our Military Services Group  Keystone currently faces competition from water service providers that typically provide services to particular segments of the water management cycle such as Select Energy Services Inc TETRA Technologies Inc and Baker Corp 11 Table of Contents Environmental Health and Safety and Water Quality Regulation Our water and wastewater operations including the services provided by both our Regulated Businesses and MarketBased Businesses  are subject to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations and in the case of our Canadian operations Canadian laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment health and safety the provision of water and wastewater services particularly with respect to the quality of water we deliver to our customers and the manner in which we collect treat discharge recycle and dispose of wastewater In the United States these regulations are developed under legislation including the Safe Drinking Water Act the Reduction of Lead in Drinking Water Act and the Clean Water Act States also have the authority to develop their standards and requirements in these areas We are subject to various federal state local and Canadian laws and regulations governing the storage of hazardous materials the management and disposal of hazardous and solid wastes discharges to air and water the cleanup of contaminated sites dam safety and other matters relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety PUCs also set conditions and standards for the water and wastewater services we deliver Environmental health and safety and water quality regulations are complex and change frequently For example while the EPA has issued a nonenforceable Health Advisory for the combined level of two perfluorinated compounds the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection has adopted a more stringent maximum contaminant level for a third compound perfluorononanoic acid or PFNA and perfluorooctanoic acid or PFOA and will be seeking to adopt similar standards for other perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances or PFAS The overall trend has been that drinking water standards have become increasingly more stringent over time As newer or stricter standards are introduced our capital and operating costs could increase We incur substantial costs associated with compliance with the environmental health and safety and water quality standards to which our operations are subject and we invest in technology solutions for enhanced detection and monitoring In the past our Regulated Businesses have generally been able to recover the costs associated with compliance however this recovery is affected by regulatory lag and the corresponding uncertainties surrounding rate recovery We estimate that we will make capital expenditures of 133 million and 120 million during 2019 and 2020  respectively for environmental control facilities which we define for this purpose as any project or portion thereof that involves the preservation of air water or land We also maintain an environmental program that includes responsible business practices compliance with environmental laws and regulations and effective use of natural resources We believe that our operations are materially in compliance with and in many cases surpass minimum standards required by applicable environmental laws and regulations Our operations also involve the use storage and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes For example our water and wastewater treatment facilities store and use chlorine and other chemicals that generate wastes that require proper handling and disposal under applicable environmental requirements We also could incur remedial costs in connection with any contamination relating to our operations or facilities or our offsite disposal of wastes The Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 CERCLA authorizes the EPA and comparable state laws authorize state environmental authorities to issue orders and bring enforcement actions to compel responsible parties to investigate and take remedial actions at any site that is determined to present an actual or potential threat to human health or the environment because of an actual or threatened release of one or more hazardous substances Parties that generated or transported hazardous substances to such sites as well as current and former owners and operators of such sites may be deemed liable without regard to fault under CERCLA or comparable state laws Although we are not aware of any material cleanup or decontamination obligations the discovery of contamination or the imposition of such obligations in the future could result in additional costs Our facilities and operations are also subject to requirements under the US Occupational Safety and Health Act and inspections thereunder Certain of our subsidiaries are involved in pending legal proceedings relating to environmental matters See Item 3Legal Proceedings for additional information Safe Drinking Water Act The Safe Drinking Water Act and related regulations establish national quality standards for drinking water The EPA has issued rules governing the levels of numerous naturally occurring and manmade chemical and microbial contaminants and radionuclides allowable in drinking water and continues to propose new rules These rules also prescribe testing requirements for detecting regulated contaminants the treatment systems that may be used for removing those contaminants and other requirements To date the EPA has set standards for approximately 90 contaminants and indicators for drinking water and there is a process in place to make a regulatory determination on at least five additional compounds every five years To help formulate the basis for future regulations the EPA has the authority to require monitoring for additional unregulated contaminants under the Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule the Monitoring Rule Our facilities have participated in the data gathering effort for the Monitoring Rule in previous rounds which occurs every five years and are also a participant in the ongoing fourth round which is scheduled for completion by the end of 2020 There are millions of other chemical compounds that are not regulated many of which are lacking a testing methodology occurrence data health effects information andor treatment technology The process of developing new drinking water standards is long and complex but we actively participate with the EPA and other water industry groups by sharing research and water quality operational knowledge See Item 1BusinessResearch and DevelopmentEmerging Containments for additional information 12 Table of Contents To effect the removal or inactivation of microbial organisms the EPA has established various rules to improve the disinfection and filtration of drinking water and to reduce consumers exposure to disinfectants and byproducts of the disinfection process In 2006 the EPA issued the LongTerm 2 Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule and the Stage 2 Disinfectants and Disinfection Byproduct Rule and finalized the Ground Water Rule which is applicable to systems providing water from underground sources In 2016 the revised Total Coliform Rule implemented a find and fix process where exceeding bacterial trigger levels requires an assessment to correct any sanitary defects We are within the EPAs time frame for compliance with these standards which includes sample collection data analysis engineering planning and system implementation Recent monitoring under the LongTerm 2 Rule has resulted in the need for more than 30 of our surface water systems to provide additional protection against cryptosporidium In most cases this will involve installing UV disinfection at an estimated cost ranging from 150 million to 250 million  Further the EPA is actively considering regulations for a number of contaminants including strontium hexavalent chromium fluoride nitrosamines perchlorate some pharmaceuticals and certain volatile organic compounds We do not anticipate that any such regulations if enacted will require implementation in 2019 Across the Company we conduct over one million water quality tests each year at our laboratory facilities and plant operations including continuous online instrumentations such as monitoring turbidity levels disinfectant residuals and adjustments to chemical treatment based on changes in incoming water We participate in the Partnership for Safe Water the EPAs voluntary program to meet more stringent goals for reducing microbial contaminants With 69 of our 81 surface water treatment plants receiving the EPA programs prestigious Director award which recognizes utilities that i have completed a comprehensive selfassessment report ii created an action plan for continuous improvement and iii produced highquality drinking water we account for approximately onethird of the plants receiving such awards nationwide In addition 67 of our surface water treatment plants have received the FiveYear Phase III award 62 plants have received the TenYear Phase III award 58 plants have received the FifteenYear Phase III award and 3 plants have received the TwentyYear Phase III award these awards recognize plants that have met the Director award status for five 10 15 and 20 years respectively Further nine of our surface water plants have received the Presidents award which recognizes treatment plants that achieve the Partnerships rigorous individual filter effluent turbidity standards Although it is difficult to project the ultimate costs of complying with the above or other pending or future requirements we expect current requirements under the Safe Drinking Water Act and other similar laws to be recoverable through the regulatory process and therefore compliance costs are not expected to have a material impact on our operations or financial condition In addition capital expenditures and operating costs to comply with environmental mandates have been traditionally recognized by PUCs as appropriate for inclusion in establishing rates As a result we expect to recover the operating and capital costs resulting from these pending or future requirements Lead and Copper Rule and Reduction of Lead in Drinking Water Act Across the country there is a renewed focus on the potential risk of lead in drinking water In 1991 the EPA published the Lead and Copper Rule LCR to control lead and copper in drinking water and since that time has issued minor revisions in 2000 2004 and 2007 enhancing monitoring reporting and public education requirements In 2011 Congress enacted the Reduction of Lead in Drinking Water Act regarding the use and introduction into commerce of lead pipes plumbing fittings for fixtures solder and flux While these advances have made an impact in reducing lead exposure in drinking water legacy lead plumbing materials primarily in building plumbing still remain in many communities The EPA is currently working to develop longterm revisions to the LCR with a revised draft likely in 2019 It is currently estimated that approximately 5 of our service lines contain lead LSLs We have reviewed our inventories of company owned service lines our related practices and are working with stakeholders to develop feasible solutions to remove legacy lead from service lines in older neighborhoods Our goal is to replace our LSLs in most areas over an approximate 10year time frame at an estimated cost ranging from 600 million to 12 billion  In cases where we are replacing an American Water owned LSL our standard approach will be to replace the companyowned portion of the service line and work with the customer to replace the customerowned portion of the service line at the same time Replacing the full service line is considered a best practice as advised by the Lead Service Line Replacement Collaborative and the American Water Works Association The Lead Service Line Replacement Collaborative is a diverse group of public health water utility environmental labor consumer and housing organizations from across the country working together to encourage communities to accelerate the full replacement of LSLs through collaborative efforts at the local level The prioritization of this work will depend on several factors including our planned water main and service line renewal projects adjacent projects by municipalities or other utilities LCR compliance monitoring results and cooperation with our customers with respect to the customerowned portion of the service line There is also a special focus placed on lowincome neighborhoods 13 Table of Contents Clean Water Act The Clean Water Act regulates discharges from drinking water and wastewater treatment facilities into lakes rivers streams and groundwater In addition to requirements applicable to our wastewater collection systems our operations require discharge permits under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System NPDES permit program established under the Clean Water Act which must be renewed every five years Pursuant to the NPDES permit program the EPA and implementing states set maximum discharge limits for wastewater effluents and overflows from wastewater collection systems Discharges that exceed the limits specified under NPDES permits can lead to the imposition of fines and penalties and persistent noncompliance could lead to significant fines and penalties and other compliance costs In addition the difficulty of obtaining and complying with NPDES permits and renewing expiring permits may impose time and cost burdens on our operations From time to time discharge violations occur at our facilities some of which result in fines We do not expect any such violations or fines to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition Environmental Social Responsibility and Governance Integrating environmental social responsibility and governance ESG policies and practices

health and safety and water quality standards and regulation This relationship includes the sharing of our research such as our treatment and distribution system optimization research and our national water quality monitoring data Our engagement with the EPA provides us with early insight into emerging regulatory issues and initiatives thereby allowing us to anticipate and to accommodate our future compliance requirements We also frequently engage with the Centers for Disease Control and other state environmental agencies We believe that continued RD activities are critical for providing safe reliable and affordable services as well as maintaining our leadership position in the industry which provides us with a competitive advantage as we seek additional business with new and existing customers Emerging Contaminants Emerging contaminants include chemicals such as pharmaceuticals personal care products pesticides herbicides and endocrine disrupting compounds as well as some naturally occurring microbes such as bacteria viruses and parasites which have been detected in drinking water supplies for which the risk to the publics health is not fully understood andor has not been quantified While these contaminants have been present in our drinking water for as long as they have been in use technological advances have only recently made it possible to detect many of them The ability to detect contaminants even at trace levels has raised questions among regulators and government agencies further affecting the publics perception of drinking water quality The Chemicals Abstract Service Registry contains over 140 million registered chemicals with a new substance being produced approximately every 3 seconds from chemical breakdown and reformation There are over 1400 microbes which can affect drinking water We are continually investigating new substances and contaminants employing a team of scientists engineers and public health professionals to identify threats to our water supply to act on emerging regulations and new health advisories and to evaluate the benefits of alternative or advanced treatment technologies We maintain stateoftheart water quality testing equipment and implement new and emerging technologies to help predict and manage potential water supply contamination issues Examples of our efforts include  using our research findings to communicate information to our customers on the actions they can take to manage Legionella the Centers for Disease Control statistics indicate that waterassociated disease from Legionella is on the rise with exposure typically associated with customerowned plumbing systems in large buildings  aerial drone testing to detect harmful algal blooms and testing ultrasonic technology to help prevent taste and odor events and to eliminate cyanotoxins before they get to the water treatment plant  the implementation of water source assessment tools including sensors and analytics to evaluate and track chemical storage and transport through watersheds and to detect source water contamination events and  the implementation of activated carbon and biofiltration for the control of emerging contaminants Service Company and Security American Water Works Service Company Inc the Service Company is our wholly owned subsidiary that provides support and operational services to the Companys

from our Investor Relations Department American Water Works Company Inc 1 Water Street Camden NJ 08102 ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS We operate in a market and regulatory environment that involves significant risks many of which are beyond our control In addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Form 10K the following factors should be considered in evaluating our business and future prospects Any of the following risks either alone or taken together could materially and adversely affect our business financial position results of operations cash flows and liquidity Risks Related to Our Industry and Business Operations Our utility operations are subject to extensive economic regulation by state PUCs and other regulatory agencies which significantly affects our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows Our utility operations also may be subject to fines penalties and other sanctions for the inability to meet these regulatory requirements Our Regulated Businesses provide water and wastewater services to our customers through subsidiaries that are subject to economic regulation by state PUCs Economic regulation affects the rates we charge our customers and has a significant impact on our business and results of operations Generally the state PUCs authorize us to charge rates that they determine are sufficient to recover our prudently incurred operating expenses including but not limited to operating and maintenance costs depreciation financing costs and taxes and provide us the opportunity to earn an appropriate rate of return on invested capital 18 Table of Contents Our ability to successfully implement our business plan and strategy depends on the rates authorized by the various state PUCs We periodically file rate increase applications with state PUCs The ensuing administrative process may be lengthy and costly Our rate increase requests may or may not be approved or may be partially approved and any approval may not occur in a timely manner Moreover a PUC may not approve a rate request to an extent that is sufficient to  cover our expenses including purchased water and costs of chemicals fuel and other commodities used in our operations  enable us to recover our investment and  provide us with an opportunity to earn an appropriate rate of return on our investment Approval of the PUCs is also required in connection with other aspects of our utilities operations Some state PUCs are empowered to impose financial penalties fines and other sanctions for noncompliance with applicable rules and regulations Our utilities are also required to have numerous permits approvals and certificates from the PUCs that regulate their businesses and authorize acquisitions Although we believe that each utility subsidiary has obtained or sought renewal of the material permits approvals and certificates necessary for its existing operations we are unable to predict the impact that future regulatory activities may have on our business In any of these cases our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity may be adversely affected Even if rates are sufficient we face the risk that we will not achieve the rates of return on our invested capital to the extent permitted by state PUCs This could occur if certain conditions exist including but not limited to if water usage is less than the level anticipated in establishing rates or if our investments or expenses prove to be higher than the level estimated in establishing rates Our operations and the quality of water we supply are subject to extensive and increasingly stringent environmental water quality and health and safety laws and regulations including with respect to emerging contaminants compliance with which could impact our operating costs and violations of which could subject us to substantial liabilities and costs as well as damage to our reputation Our regulated water and wastewater operations and the operations of our MarketBased Businesses are subject to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations and in the case of our Canadian operations Canadian laws and regulations that govern the protection of the environment health and safety the quality of the water we deliver to our customers water allocation rights and the manner in which we collect treat discharge and dispose of wastewater These requirements include CERCLA the Clean Water Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act EPA requirements and similar federal state and Canadian laws and regulations For example CERCLA authorizes the EPA to issue orders and bring enforcement actions to compel responsible parties to investigate and take remedial actions with respect to actual or threatened releases of hazardous substances and can impose joint and several liability without regard to fault on responsible parties for the costs thereof We are also required to obtain various environmental permits from regulatory agencies for our operations In addition state PUCs and environmental regulators also set conditions and standards for the water and wastewater services we deliver If we deliver water or wastewater services to our customers that do not comply with regulatory standards or otherwise violate environmental laws regulations or permits or other health and safety and water quality regulations we could incur substantial fines penalties or other sanctions or costs as well as damage to our reputation In the most serious cases regulators could reduce requested rate increases or force us to discontinue operations and sell our operating assets to another utility or to a municipality Given the nature of our business which in part involves supplying water for human consumption any potential noncompliance with or violation of environmental water quality and health and safety laws or regulations would likely pose a more significant risk to us than to a company not similarly involved in the water and wastewater industry We incur substantial operating and capital costs on an ongoing basis to comply with environmental water quality and health and safety laws and regulations These laws and regulations and their enforcement generally have become more stringent over time and new or stricter requirements could increase our costs Although we may seek to recover ongoing compliance costs in our Regulated Businesses through customer rates there can be no guarantee that the various state PUCs or similar regulatory bodies that govern our Regulated Businesses would approve rate increases that would enable us to recover such costs or that such costs will not materially and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity We may also incur liabilities if under environmental laws and regulations we are required to investigate and clean up environmental contamination including potential spills of hazardous chemicals such as chlorine which we use to treat water or at offsite locations where we have disposed of waste or caused an adverse environmental impact The discovery of previously unknown conditions or the imposition of cleanup obligations in the future could result in significant costs and could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity Such remediation costs may not be covered by insurance and may make it difficult for us to secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future 19 Table of Contents Attention is being given to emerging contaminants including without limitation chemicals and other substances that currently do not have any regulatory standard in drinking water or have been recently created or discovered including by means of scientific achievements in the analysis and detection of trace amounts of substances Examples of sources of emerging contaminants include but are not limited to newly created chemical compounds including for example manufactured nanomaterials human and veterinary products perfluorinated and polyfluorinated compounds including PFNA PFOA and other PFAS bacteria microbes viruses amoebae and other pathogens and residual byproducts of disinfection We rely upon governmental agencies to set appropriate regulatory standards to protect the public from these and other contaminants and our role is to provide service that meets these standards if any In some of our states PUCs may disapprove of cost recovery in whole or in part for implementation of treatment infrastructure for an emerging contaminant in the absence of a regulatory standard Furthermore given the rapid pace at which emerging contaminants are being created andor discovered we may not be able to detect andor mitigate all such substances in our drinking water system or supplies which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and reputation In addition we believe emerging contaminants may form the basis for additional or increased federal or state regulatory initiatives and requirements in the future which could significantly increase the cost of our operations Limitations on availability of water supplies or restrictions on our use of water supplies as a result of government regulation or action may adversely affect our access to sources of water our ability to supply water to customers or the demand for our water services Our ability to meet the existing and future demand of our customers depends on the availability of an adequate supply of water As a general rule sources of public water supply including rivers lakes streams and groundwater aquifers are held in the public trust and are not owned by private interests As a result we typically do not own the water that we use in our operations and the availability of our water supply is established through allocation rights determined by legislation or court decisions and passingflow requirements set by governmental entities Passingflow requirements set minimum volumes of water that must pass through specified water sources such as rivers and streams in order to maintain environmental habitats and meet water allocation rights of downstream users Allocation rights are imposed to ensure sustainability of major water sources and passingflow requirements are most often imposed on source waters from smaller rivers lakes and streams These requirements which can change from time to time and vary by state or region may adversely impact our water supply Supply issues such as drought overuse of sources of water the protection of threatened species or habitats contamination or other factors may limit the availability of ground and surface water For example in our Monterey County California operations we are seeking to augment our sources of water supply principally to comply with an October 20 2009 cease and desist order the 2009 Order as amended by an order in July 2016 the 2016 Order of the SWRCB that requires CaliforniaAmerican Water Company our wholly owned subsidiary Cal Am to significantly decrease its diversions from the Carmel River in accordance with a reduction schedule that terminates on December 31 2021 the 2021 Deadline We are also required to augment our Monterey County sources of water supply to comply with the requirements of the Endangered Species Act We cannot predict whether Cal Am will be able to secure alternative sources of water or if Cal Am will be exposed to liabilities if it is unable to meet the 2021 Deadline under the 2009 Order and the 2016 Order If Cal Am or any of our other subsidiaries are unable to secure an alternative source of water or if other adverse consequences result from the events described above our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected See Item 3Legal Proceedings Alternative Water Supply in Lieu of Carmel River Diversions which includes additional information regarding this matter The current regulatory rate setting process may result in a significant delay also known as regulatory lag from the time that we invest in infrastructure improvements incur increased operating expenses or experience declining water usage to the time at which we can seek to address these events in rate case applications our inability to minimize regulatory lag could adversely affect our business There is typically a delay known as regulatory lag between the time one of our regulated subsidiaries makes a capital investment or incurs an operating expense increase and the time when those costs are reflected in rates In addition billings permitted by state PUCs typically are to a considerable extent based on the volume of water usage in addition to a minimum base rate Thus we may experience regulatory lag between the time our revenues are affected by declining usage and the time we are able to adjust the rate per gallon of usage to address declining usage Our inability to reduce regulatory lag could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity 20 Table of Contents We endeavor to reduce regulatory lag by pursuing constructive regulatory policies For example three of our states have approved revenue stability mechanisms that adjust rates periodically to ensure that a utilitys revenue will be sufficient to cover its costs regardless of sales volume including recognition of declining sales resulting from reduced consumption while providing an incentive for customers to use water more efficiently In addition ten of our state PUCs permit rates to be adjusted outside of the general rate case application process through surcharges that address certain capital investments such as replacement of aging infrastructure These surcharges are adjusted periodically based on factors such as project completion or future budgeted expenditures and specific surcharges are eliminated once the related capital investment is incorporated in new PUC approved rates Furthermore in setting rates ten of our state PUCs allow us to use future test years which extend beyond the date a rate request is filed to allow for current or projected revenues expenses and investments to be reflected in rates on a more timely basis Other examples of such programs include states that allow us to increase rates for certain cost increases that are beyond our control such as purchased water costs property or other taxes or power conservation chemical or other expenditures These surcharge mechanisms enable us to adjust rates in less time after costs have been incurred than would be the case under the general rate case application process While these programs have reduced regulatory lag in several of our regulated states we continue to seek expansion of programs to reduce regulatory lag in those jurisdictions that have not approved such programs Furthermore PUCs may fail to adopt new surcharge programs and existing programs may not continue in their current form or at all Although we intend to continue our efforts to expand state PUC approval of surcharges to address issues of regulatory lag our efforts may not be successful or even if successful they may not completely address our regulatory lag in which case our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity may be materially and adversely affected Changes in laws and regulations and changes in certain agreements can significantly affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity New legislation regulations government policies or court decisions including without limitation with respect to federal and state income and other tax laws can materially affect our operations results of operations and cash flows The individuals who serve as regulators are elected or political appointees Therefore elections which result in a change of political administration or new appointments may also result in changes in the individuals who serve as regulators and the policies of the regulatory agencies that they serve New laws or regulations new interpretations of existing laws or regulations changes in agency policy including those made in response to shifts in public opinion or conditions imposed during the regulatory hearing process could have the following consequences among others  making it more difficult for us to increase our rates and as a consequence to recover our costs or earn our expected rates of return  changing the determination of the costs or the amount of costs that would be considered recoverable in rate cases  restricting our ability to terminate our services to customers who owe us money for services previously provided or limiting our bill collection efforts  requiring us to provide water or wastewater services at reduced rates to certain customers  limiting or restricting our ability to acquire water or wastewater systems purchase or dispose of assets or issue securities or making it less costeffective for us to do so  negatively impacting the deductibility of expenses under federal or state tax laws the amount of tax credits or tax abatement benefits that may be available the amount of taxes owed or the ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards  changing regulations that affect the benefits we expected to receive when we began offering services in a particular area  increasing the costs associated with complying with environmental health safety and water quality regulations to which our operations are subject  changing or placing additional limitations on change in control requirements relating to any concentration of ownership of our common stock  making it easier for governmental entities to convert our assets to public ownership via condemnation eminent domain or other similar process or for governmental agencies or private plaintiffs to assess liability against us for damages under these or similar processes  placing limitations prohibitions or other requirements with respect to the sharing of information and participation in transactions by or between a regulated subsidiary and us or our other affiliates including Service Company and any of our other subsidiaries  restricting or prohibiting our extraction of water from rivers streams reservoirs or aquifers and  revoking or altering the terms of the CPCN issued to us by state PUCs 21 Table of Contents Any of the foregoing consequences could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity In addition new Federal state and local laws changes in existing laws rules or regulations or administrative interpretations thereof could impact us On December 22 2017 the TCJA was signed into law which among other things enacted significant and complex changes to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as amended the Code including a reduction in the maximum US federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 as of January 1 2018 and certain other provisions related specifically to the public utility industry including continuation of interest expense deductibility the exclusion from utilizing bonus depreciation and the normalization of deferred income taxes The enactment of the TCJA required remeasurement of our deferred income taxes which materially impacted our 2017 results of operations and financial position and had a lesser impact on our 2018 results of operations and financial position During 2018 all of our 14 jurisdictions subject to economic regulation opened formal proceedings related to the TCJA and proceedings presently remain open in three of them Further the regulatory treatment of the remeasured deferred income taxes remains open in a number of these jurisdictions At this time we cannot predict the impacts on us of the regulatory treatment of the TCJA in these open proceedings or matters or of the enactment or adoption of any Related Interpretations if and when issued Moreover we are unable to determine or predict the potential impacts if any of any other new or amended laws rules or regulations or interpretations thereof to the extent they may be ultimately enacted adopted or issued on us or our businesses financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity Service disruptions caused by severe weather conditions climate variability patterns or natural disasters may disrupt our operations or reduce the demand for our water services which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity Service interruptions due to severe weather climate variability patterns and other natural events are possible across all our businesses These include among other things storms freezing conditions high wind conditions hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes landslides drought wildfires coastal and intercoastal floods or high water conditions including those in or near designated flood plains severe electrical storms and solar flares Weather and other natural events such as these may affect the condition or operability of our facilities limiting or preventing us from delivering water or wastewater services to our customers or requiring us to make substantial capital expenditures to repair any damage Tariffs in place or cost recovery proceedings with respect to our Regulated Businesses may not provide reimbursement to us in whole or in part for any of these impacts Government restrictions on water use may also result in decreased use of water services even if our water supplies are sufficient to serve our customers which may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows Seasonal drought conditions that may impact our water services are possible across all of our service areas Governmental restrictions imposed in response to a drought may apply to all systems within a region independent of the supply adequacy of any individual system As examples drought conditions had persisted in California over a fiveyear period and had been declared in New Jersey in 2016 In 2017 these droughts were declared concluded but other droughts that may occur from time to time may result in the imposition of voluntary or mandatory water use targets rationing restrictions water conservation regulations and requirements to minimize water system leaks While expenses incurred in implementing water conservation and rationing plans may generally be recoverable provided the relevant PUC determines they were reasonable and prudent we cannot assure that any such expenses incurred will in fact be fully recovered Moreover reductions in water consumption including those resulting from installation of equipment or changed consumer behavior may persist even after drought restrictions are repealed and the drought has ended which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows Climate variability may cause increased volatility in weather and may impact water usage and related revenue or require additional expenditures all of which may not be fully recoverable in rates or otherwise The issue of climate variability is receiving increasing attention nationally and worldwide Some scientific experts are predicting a worsening of weather volatility in the future associated with climate variability Many climate variability predictions if true present several potential challenges to water and wastewater utilities such as  increased frequency and duration of droughts  increased precipitation and flooding  increased frequency and severity of storms and other weather events  challenges associated with changes in temperature or increases in ocean levels  potential degradation of water quality  decreases in available water supply and changes in water usage patterns  increases in disruptions in service 22 Table of Contents  increased costs to repair damaged facilities or  increased costs to reduce risks associated with the increasing frequency of natural events including to improve the resiliency and reliability of our water production and delivery facilities and systems Because of the uncertainty of weather volatility related to climate variability we cannot predict its potential impact on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity Although some or all potential expenditures and costs with respect to our Regulated Businesses could be recovered through rates infrastructure replacement surcharges or other regulatory mechanisms there can be no assurance that state PUCs would authorize rate increases to enable us to recover such expenditures and costs in whole or in part A loss of one or more large industrial customers could have a material adverse impact upon the results of operations of one or more of our Regulated Businesses Adverse economic conditions or other factors can cause our customers particularly industrial customers to curtail operations A curtailment of operations by an industrial customer would typically result in reduced water usage by that customer In more severe circumstances the decline in usage could be permanent Any decrease in demand resulting from difficult economic conditions affecting these industrial customers could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations Tariffs in place with respect to our Regulated Businesses may not reimburse us in whole or in part for any of these impacts Our Regulated Businesses require significant capital expenditures and may suffer if we fail to secure appropriate funding to make investments or if we experience delays in completing major capital expenditure projects The water and wastewater utility business is capital intensive We invest significant amounts of capital to add replace and maintain property plant and equipment and to improve aging infrastructure In 2018  we invested 15 billion in net Companyfunded capital improvements The level of capital expenditures necessary to maintain the integrity of our systems will continue into the future and may increase We expect to fund capital improvement projects using cash generated from operations borrowings under our revolving credit facility and commercial paper programs and issuances of longterm debt We may not be able to access our revolving credit facility or the commercial paper longterm debt and equity capital markets when necessary or desirable to fund capital improvements on favorable terms or at all If we are not able to obtain sufficient financing we could be unable to maintain our existing property plant and equipment fund our capital investment strategies meet our growth targets and expand our rate base to enable us to earn satisfactory future returns on our investments Even with adequate financial resources to make required capital expenditures we face the additional risk that we will not complete our major capital projects on time as a result of construction delays permitting delays labor shortages or other disruptions environmental restrictions or other obstacles Each of these outcomes could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows Seasonality could adversely affect the volume of water sold and our revenues The volume of water we sell during the warmer months typically in the summer is generally greater than during other months due primarily to increased water usage for irrigation systems swimming pools cooling systems and other applications Throughout the year and particularly during typically warmer months the volume of water sold tends to vary with temperature rainfall levels and rainfall frequency In the event that temperatures during the typically warmer months are cooler than normal or if there is more rainfall than normal the amount of water we sell may decrease and adversely affect our revenues Three of our jurisdictions California Illinois and New York have adopted revenue stability mechanisms that permit us to collect state PUCauthorized revenue for a given period which is not tied to the volume of water sold during that period Revenue stability mechanisms are designed to allow utilities to recover the fixed cost of operations while supporting water conservation goals In those jurisdictions that have not adopted a revenue stability mechanism operating results could continue to be affected by seasonality Regulatory and environmental risks associated with the collection treatment and disposal of wastewater may impose significant costs The wastewater collection treatment and disposal operations of our subsidiaries are subject to substantial regulation and involve environmental risks If collection treatment or disposal systems fail overflow or do not operate properly untreated wastewater or other contaminants could spill onto nearby properties or into nearby streams and rivers causing damage to persons or property injury to aquatic life and economic damages This risk is most acute during periods of substantial rainfall or flooding which are the main causes of sewer overflow and system failure Liabilities resulting from such damage could adversely and materially affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 23 Table of Contents Contamination of water supplies or our water service provided to our customers could result in service limitations and interruptions and exposure to substances not typically found in potable water supplies and could subject us and our subsidiaries to reductions in usage and other responsive obligations government enforcement actions damage to our reputation and private litigation The water supplies that flow into our treatment plants or are delivered through our distribution system or the water service that is provided to our customers may be subject to contamination including among other items contamination from naturallyoccurring compounds chemicals in groundwater systems pollution resulting from manmade sources such as perchlorate methyl tertiary butyl ether lead and other materials chemical spills or other accidents that result in contaminants entering the water source and possible terrorist attacks In addition new categories of these substances continue to emerge in the water industry If one of our water supplies or the water service provided to our customers is contaminated depending on the nature of the contamination we may have to take responsive actions that could include among other things 1 continuing limited use of the water supply under a Do Not Use protective order that enables continuation of basic sanitation and essential fire protection or 2 interrupting the use of that water supply If service is disrupted our financial condition results of operations cash flows liquidity and reputation may be adversely affected In addition we may incur significant costs in order to treat the contaminated source through the expansion of our current treatment facilities or the development of new sources of supply or new treatment methods We may be unable to recover costs associated with treating or decontaminating water supplies through insurance customer rates tariffs or contract terms Any recovery of these costs that we are able to obtain through regulatory proceedings or otherwise may not occur in a timely manner Moreover we could be subject to claims for damages arising from government enforcement actions or toxic tort or other lawsuits arising out of an interruption of service or human exposure to hazardous substances in our drinking water and water supplies Since we engage in the business of providing water service to our customers contamination of the water supply or the water service provided to our customers could result in substantial injury or damage to our customers employees or others and we could be exposed to substantial claims and litigation Such claims could relate to among other things personal injury loss of life business interruption property damage pollution and environmental damage and may be brought by our customers or third parties Litigation and regulatory proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings can and do occur and we may not be protected from these claims or negative impacts therefrom in whole or in part by tariffs or other contract terms Negative impacts to our reputation may occur even if we are not liable for any contamination or other environmental damage or the consequences arising out of human exposure to contamination or hazardous substances in the water or water supplies In addition insurance coverage may not cover all or a portion of these losses and are subject to deductibles and other limitations Pending or future claims against us could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows We may sustain losses that exceed or are excluded from our insurance coverage or for which we are selfinsured We maintain insurance coverage as part of our overall legal and risk management strategy to minimize potential liabilities arising from our utility operations as well as the operations of our MarketBased Businesses  Our insurance programs have varying coverage limits exclusions and maximums and insurance companies may seek to deny claims we might make Generally our insurance policies cover property damage workers compensation employers liability general liability cybersecurity terrorism risks and automobile liability Each policy includes deductibles or selfinsured retentions and policy limits for covered claims As a result we may sustain losses that exceed or that are excluded from our insurance coverage or for which we are selfinsured Although in the past we have been generally able to obtain insurance coverage related to our business there can be no assurance that we can secure all necessary or appropriate insurance in the future or that such insurance can be economically secured For example catastrophic events can result in decreased coverage limits more limited coverage increased premium costs or deductibles We are subject to adverse publicity and reputational risks which make us vulnerable to negative customer perception and could lead to increased regulatory oversight or sanctions Water and wastewater utilities including our regulated subsidiaries and our MarketBased Businesses  have a large direct and indirect customer base and as a result are exposed to public criticism regarding among other things the reliability of their water wastewater and related or ancillary services the quality of water provided and the amount timeliness accuracy and format of bills that are provided for such services Adverse publicity and negative consumer sentiment may render legislatures and other governing bodies state PUCs and other regulatory authorities and government officials less likely to view us in a favorable light and may cause us to be susceptible to less favorable legislative regulatory and economic outcomes as well as increased regulatory or other oversight and more stringent regulatory or economic requirements Unfavorable regulatory and economic outcomes may include the enactment of more stringent laws and regulations governing our operations and less favorable economic terms in our agreements related to our MarketBased Businesses  as well as fines penalties or other sanctions or requirements The imposition of any of the foregoing could have a material negative impact on us and our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 24 Table of Contents New York American Water Company Inc NYAW has been the subject of a New York State Public Service Commission NYSPSC investigation related to the unintentional provision of incorrect data to a taxing authority that resulted in an overassessment of real property taxes NYAW selfreported this issue to the NYSPSC promptly after NYAWs senior leadership became aware of it Neither NYAW nor any of its employees received any financial benefit as a result of this matter as all customer overpayments were provided to the local taxing authorities The NYSPSC investigation also related to the failure of a few employees working on NYAWs 2016 general rate case to properly disclose these issues in that rate case On September 11 2018 the Supreme Court of the State of New York Albany County approved a settlement of these matters and NYAW is cooperating with the NYSDPS to implement its terms As part of the settlement NYAW agreed that it would provide up to 45 million to benefit NYAW customers through several different mechanisms which amounts would not be recoverable in rates NYAW also agreed to accelerate the timing of the payment of approximately 64 million in aggregate customer credits Finally NYAW agreed to engage and cooperate with an independent monitor through September 30 2021 While the settlement resolves the NYSPSCs investigation involving NYAW and those matters set forth above there can be no assurance that NYAW will not be subject to additional federal state or local proceedings regarding these and other related matters and these proceedings could result in increased oversight and civil administrative andor criminal sanctions which may have a material adverse effect upon our reputation and perception Unfavorable regulatory and economic outcomes also may include the enactment of more stringent laws and regulations governing our operations and less favorable economic terms in our agreements related to our MarketBased Businesses as well as fines penalties or other sanctions or requirements The imposition of any of the foregoing could have a material negative impact on us and our financial condition results of operations and cash flows The failure of or the requirement to repair upgrade or dismantle any of our dams may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity The properties of our Regulated Businesses segment include 80 dams the majority of which are earthen dams and the failure of any of which could result in personal injury and property damage including without limitation downstream property damage for which we may be liable The failure of a dam would also adversely affect our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations Any losses or liabilities incurred due to a failure of one of our dams might not be covered by insurance policies or be recoverable in rates and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future We also are required from time to time to decommission repair or upgrade the dams that we own The cost of such repairs or upgrades can be and has been material The federal and state agencies that regulate our operations may adopt rules and regulations requiring us to dismantle our dams which also could entail material costs Although in most cases the PUC has permitted recovery of expenses and capital investment related to dam rehabilitation we might not be able to recover costs of repairs upgrades or dismantling through rates in the future The inability to recover these costs or delayed recovery of the costs as a result of regulatory lag can affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity Any failure of our network of water and wastewater pipes and water reservoirs could result in losses and damages that may affect our financial condition and reputation Our operating subsidiaries distribute water and collect wastewater through an extensive network of pipes and storage systems located across the United States A failure of major pipes or reservoirs could result in injuries property and other damage for which we may be liable The failure of major pipes and reservoirs may also result in the need to shut down some facilities or parts of our network in order to conduct repairs Such failures and shutdowns may limit our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and to meet the water and wastewater delivery requirements prescribed by government regulators including state PUCs with jurisdiction over our operations and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows liquidity and reputation Any business interruption or other losses might not be covered by insurance policies or be recoverable in rates and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future Moreover to the extent such business interruptions or other losses are not covered by insurance they may not be recovered through rate adjustments An important part of our growth strategy is the acquisition of water and wastewater systems which involves risks including competition for acquisition opportunities from other regulated utilities governmental entities and other buyers that may hinder or limit our ability to grow our business An important element of our growth strategy is the acquisition of water and wastewater systems in order to broaden our current and move into new service areas We may not be able to acquire other systems or businesses if we cannot identify suitable acquisition opportunities or reach mutually agreeable terms with acquisition candidates Further competition for acquisition opportunities from other regulated utilities governmental entities and other buyers may hinder our ability to expand our business 25 Table of Contents The negotiation of potential acquisitions as well as the integration of acquired systems or businesses with our existing operations could require us to incur significant costs and cause diversion of our managements time and resources Future acquisitions by us could result in among other things  incurrence or assumption of debt contingent liabilities and environmental liabilities of or with respect to an acquired business including liabilities that were unknown at the time of acquisition  failure to recover acquisition premiums  unanticipated capital expenditures  failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting  recording goodwill and other intangible assets at values that ultimately may be subject to impairment charges  fluctuations in quarterly results  unanticipated acquisitionrelated expenses  failure to realize anticipated benefits such as cost savings and revenue enhancements and  difficulties in assimilating personnel benefits services and systems Some or all of these items could have a material adverse effect on our business The systems and businesses we acquire in the future may not achieve anticipated sales and profitability or other perceived synergies and any difficulties we encounter in the integration process could interfere with our operations reduce our operating margins and adversely affect our internal control over financial reporting We compete with governmental entities other regulated utilities and strategic and financial buyers for acquisition opportunities If consolidation becomes more prevalent in the water and wastewater industries and competition for acquisitions increases the prices for suitable acquisition candidates may increase and limit our ability to expand through acquisitions Our Regulated Businesses are subject to condemnation and other proceedings through eminent domain or other similar authorized process which could materially and adversely affect their results of operations and financial condition Municipalities and other government subdivisions have historically been involved in the provision of water and wastewater services in the United States and organized efforts may arise from time to time in one or more of the service areas in which our Regulated Businesses operate to convert our assets to public ownership and operation through exercise of the governmental power of eminent domain or another similar authorized process If a municipality or other government subdivision or a citizen group seeks to acquire our assets through eminent domain or such other process either directly or indirectly as a result of a citizen petition we may resist the acquisition For example on November 27 2018 Monterey California ballot Measure J was certified as having been approved by a public vote requiring the MPWMD to conduct a feasibility study and submit a written plan concerning the feasibility of a potential purchase of our California subsidiarys Monterey water service assets without an additional public vote Also five municipalities in the Chicago Illinois area formed a water agency that filed an eminent domain lawsuit against our Illinois subsidiary in January 2013 seeking to condemn a water pipeline that serves those five municipalities See Item 1BusinessRegulated BusinessesCondemnation and Eminent Domain  which includes additional information regarding these matters Furthermore the law in certain jurisdictions in which our Regulated Businesses operate provides for eminent domain rights allowing private property owners to file a lawsuit to seek just compensation against a public utility if the public utilitys infrastructure has been determined to be a substantial cause of damage to that property In these actions the plaintiff would not have to prove that the public utility acted negligently In California most recently lawsuits have been filed in connection with largescale natural events such as wildfires Some have included allegations that infrastructure of certain utilities triggered the natural event that resulted in damage to the property In some cases the PUC has disallowed recovery in rates of losses incurred by these utilities as a result of such lawsuits Contesting an exercise of condemnation eminent domain or other similar process or responding to a citizen petition may result in costly legal proceedings and may divert the attention of management Moreover our efforts to resist the condemnation eminent domain or other process may not be successful which may require us to sell the operations at issue in a condemnation proceeding or to pay a private property owner compensation for the property damage suffered If a municipality or other government subdivision succeeds in acquiring the assets of one or more of our Regulated Businesses through eminent domain or other process there is a risk that we will not receive adequate compensation for the business that we will not be able to keep the compensation or that we will not be able to divest the business without incurring significant charges Any of these outcomes may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition cash flows and liquidity 26 Table of Contents We rely on technology systems to facilitate the management of our business and customer and supplier relationships and a disruption of these systems could adversely affect our business Our technology systems are an integral part of our business and any disruption of these systems could significantly limit our ability to manage and operate our business efficiently which in turn could cause our business and competitive position to suffer and adversely affect our results of operations For example we depend on these systems to bill customers process orders provide customer service manage certain plant operations and construction projects manage our financial records track assets remotely monitor certain of our plants and facilities and manage human resources supply chain inventory and accounts receivable collections Although we do not believe that these systems are at a materially greater risk of failure than other similar organizations our technology systems remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from  power loss computer systems failures and internet telecommunications or data network failures  operator error or improper operation by the negligent or improper supervision of or the intentional acts of employees and contractors  physical and electronic loss of customer or employee data due to security breaches cyber attacks hacking denial of services action misappropriation of data or other property and similar events  computer viruses and  severe weather and other events including without limitation hurricanes tornadoes fires floods earthquakes and other disasters These events may result in physical and electronic loss of customer employee or financial data security breaches misappropriation of property and other adverse consequences In addition a lack of or inadequate levels of redundancy for certain of these systems including billing systems could exacerbate the impact of any of these events on us We may not be successful in developing or acquiring technology that is competitive and responsive to the needs of our business and we might lack sufficient resources to make the necessary upgrades or replacements of outdated existing technology to enable us to continue to operate at our current level of efficiency Any or all of these events could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows We may be subject to physical andor cyber attacks As operators of critical infrastructure we may face a heightened risk of physical andor cyber attacks from internal or external sources Our water and wastewater systems may be vulnerable to disability or failures as a result of physical or cyber attacks acts of war or terrorism vandalism or other causes Our operational technology and IT systems throughout our businesses may be vulnerable to unauthorized external or internal access due to hacking viruses acts of war or terrorism and other causes Unauthorized access to confidential information located or stored on these systems could negatively and materially impact our customers employees suppliers and other third parties Further third parties including vendors suppliers and contractors who perform certain services for us or administer and maintain our sensitive information could also be targets of cyber attacks and unauthorized access While we have instituted safeguards to protect our operational technology and IT systems those safeguards may not always be effective due to the evolving nature of cyber attacks and cyber vulnerabilities We cannot guarantee that such protections will be completely successful in the event of a cyber attack If despite our security measures a significant physical attack or cyber breach occurred our operations could be disrupted property damaged and customer and other confidential information lost or stolen experience substantial loss of revenues response costs and other financial loss suffer a loss of management time attention and resources from our regular business operations and be subject to increased regulation litigation and damage to our reputation any of which could have a negative impact on our business results of operations and cash flows Experiencing a cyber security incident could also cause us to be noncompliant with applicable laws and regulations or contracts that require us to securely maintain confidential data causing us to incur costs related to legal claims or proceedings and regulatory fines or penalties These types of events either impacting our facilities or the industry in general could also cause us to incur additional security and insurance related costs In addition in the ordinary course of business we collect and retain sensitive information including personally identifiable information about our customers and employees In many cases we outsource administration of certain functions to vendors that could be targets of cyber attacks Any theft loss andor fraudulent use of customer employee or proprietary data as a result of a cyber attack could subject us to significant litigation liability and costs as well as adversely impact our reputation with customers and regulators among others 27 Table of Contents We have obtained cyber insurance to provide coverage for a portion of the losses and damages that may result from a security breach of our IT systems but such insurance is subject to a number of exclusions and may not cover the total loss or damage caused by a breach The market for cybersecurity insurance is relatively new and coverage available for cybersecurity events may evolve as the industry matures In the future adequate insurance may not be available at rates that we believe are reasonable and the costs of responding to and recovering from a cyber incident may not be covered by insurance or recoverable in rates Our inability to efficiently upgrade and improve our operational technology and IT systems or implement new systems could result in higher than expected costs or otherwise adversely impact our internal controls environment operations and profitability Upgrades and improvements to computer systems and networks or the implementation of new systems may require substantial amounts of managements time and financial resources to complete and may also result in system or network defects or operational errors due to multiple factors including employees ability to effectively use the new or upgraded system We continue to implement technology to improve our business processes and customer interactions and have installed new and upgraded existing technology systems These efforts support our broader strategic initiatives and are intended to improve our operations and enhance our customer service capabilities Any technical or other difficulties in upgrading and improving existing or implementing new technology systems may increase costs beyond those anticipated and have an adverse or disruptive effect on our operations and reporting processes including our internal control over financial reporting We may also experience difficulties integrating current systems with new or upgraded systems which may impact our ability to serve our customers effectively or efficiently Although we make efforts to minimize any adverse impact on our controls business and operations we cannot assure that all such impacts have been or will be mitigated and any such impacts could harm our business individually or collectively and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows Our business has inherently dangerous workplaces If we fail to maintain safe work sites we may experience workforce injuries or loss of life and be exposed to financial losses including penalties and other liabilities Our safety record is critical to our reputation We maintain health and safety standards to protect our employees customers contractors vendors and the public Although we intend to adhere to such health and safety standards and aim for zero injuries it is extremely difficult to avoid all accidents or other safety incidents at all times Our business sites including construction and maintenance sites often put our employees contractors and others in close proximity with large pieces of equipment moving vehicles pressurized water underground trenches and vaults chemicals and other regulated materials On many sites we are responsible for safety and accordingly must implement safety procedures If we fail to implement such procedures or if the procedures we implement are ineffective or are not followed by our employees or others our employees contractors and others may be injured or die Unsafe work sites also have the potential to increase employee turnover expose us to litigation and raise our operating costs Any of the foregoing could result in financial losses which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows In addition our operations can involve the delivery handling and storage of hazardous chemicals which if improperly delivered handled stored or disposed of could result in serious injury death or property damage and could subject us to penalties or other liabilities We are also subject to regulations dealing with occupational health and safety Although we maintain functional employee groups whose primary purpose is to ensure we implement effective health safety and environmental work procedures throughout our organization including construction sites and maintenance sites the failure to comply with such regulations or procedures could subject us to liability Work stoppages and other labor relations matters could adversely affect our results of operations As of December 31 2018  approximately 49 of our workforce was represented by unions and we had 70 collective bargaining agreements in place with 15 different unions representing our unionized employees These collective bargaining agreements including 20 which expired in 2018  and 18 which will expire during 2019  are subject to periodic renewal and renegotiation We may not be able to successfully renew or renegotiate these labor contracts on terms that are fair to us Any negotiations or dispute resolution processes undertaken in connection with our labor contracts could be delayed or affected by labor actions or work stoppages Labor actions work stoppages or the threat of work stoppages and our failure to obtain favorable labor contract terms during renegotiations may disrupt our operations and result in higher labor costs which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity While we have developed contingency plans to be implemented as necessary if a work stoppage or strike does occur a strike or work stoppage may have a material adverse impact on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 28 Table of Contents Our continued success is dependent upon our ability to hire retain and utilize qualified personnel The success of our business is dependent upon our ability to hire retain and utilize qualified personnel including engineers licensed operators water quality and other operating and craft personnel and management professionals who have the required experience and expertise From time to time it may be difficult to attract and retain qualified individuals with the expertise and in the timeframe demanded for our business needs In certain geographic areas for example we may not be able to satisfy the demand for our services because of our inability to successfully hire and retain qualified personnel In addition as some of our key personnel approach retirement age we need to have appropriate succession plans in place and to successfully implement such plans If we cannot attract and retain qualified personnel or effectively implement appropriate succession plans it could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows Financial and MarketRelated Risks Our indebtedness could affect our business adversely and limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business and we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our liquidity needs As of December 31 2018  our aggregate longterm and shortterm debt balance including preferred stock with mandatory redemption requirements was 86 billion  and our working capital defined as current assets less current liabilities was in a deficit position Our indebtedness could have important consequences including  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital requirements or capital expenditures  exposing us to interest rate risk with respect to the portion of our indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates  limiting our ability to pay dividends on our common stock or make payments in connection with our other obligations  impairing our access to the capital markets for debt and equity  requiring that an increasing portion of our cash flows from operations be dedicated to the payment of the principal and interest on our debt thereby reducing funds available for future operations dividends on our common stock or capital expenditures  limiting our ability to take advantage of significant business opportunities such as acquisition opportunities and to react to changes in market or industry conditions and  placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to those of our competitors that have less debt In order to meet our capital expenditure needs we may be required to make additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility or issue new shortterm and longterm debt securities Moreover additional borrowings may be required to refinance outstanding indebtedness Debt maturities and sinking fund payments in 2019  2020 and 2021 will be 72 million  32 million and 303 million  respectively We can provide no assurance that we will be able to access the debt capital markets on favorable terms if at all Moreover if new debt is added to our current debt levels the related risks we now face could intensify limiting our ability to refinance existing debt on favorable terms In an attempt to manage our exposure to interest rate risk associated with our issuance of variable and fixed rate debt we have entered into and in the future may enter into financial derivative instruments including without limitation interest rate swaps forward starting swaps swaptions and US Treasury lock agreements See Item 7AQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  However these efforts may not be effective to fully mitigate interest rate risk and may expose us to other risks and uncertainties including quarterly mark to market valuation risk associated with these instruments that could negatively and materially affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows We will depend primarily on cash flows from operations to fund our expenses and to pay the principal and interest on our outstanding debt Therefore our ability to pay our expenses and satisfy our debt service obligations depends on our future performance which will be affected by financial business economic competitive legislative including tax initiatives and reforms and other similar legislation or regulation regulatory and other factors largely beyond our control If we do not have sufficient cash flows to pay the principal and interest on our outstanding debt we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt reduce capital investments sell assets borrow additional funds or sell additional equity In addition if our business does not generate sufficient cash flows from operations or if we are unable to incur indebtedness sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs we may be unable to plan for or respond to changes in our business which could cause our financial condition operating results and prospects to be affected adversely 29 Table of Contents Our inability to access the capital or financial markets or other events could affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs at reasonable cost and our ability to meet longterm commitments which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations In addition to cash from operations we rely primarily on our revolving credit facility commercial paper programs and the capital markets to satisfy our liquidity needs In this regard our principal external sources of shortterm liquidity are our 210 billion commercial paper program and our 225 billion revolving credit facility Our revolving credit facility expires in accordance with its terms in March 2023 We regularly use our commercial paper program under this revolving credit facility as a principal source of shortterm borrowing due to the generally more attractive rates we generally can obtain in the commercial paper market As of December 31 2018  American Water Capital Corp AWCC our wholly owned financing subsidiary had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and had 954 million of commercial paper outstanding and 81 million in outstanding letters of credit There can be no assurance that AWCC will be able to continue to access its commercial paper program or its revolving credit facility when as and if desired or that the amount of capital available thereunder will be sufficient to meet all of our liquidity needs at a reasonable or any cost Under the terms of our revolving credit facility our consolidated debt cannot exceed 70 of our consolidated capitalization as determined under the terms of the credit facility If our equity were to decline or debt were to increase to a level that caused our debt to exceed this limit lenders under the credit facility would be entitled to refuse any further extension of credit and to declare all of the outstanding debt under the credit facility immediately due and payable To avoid such a default a waiver or renegotiation of this covenant would be required which would likely increase funding costs and could result in additional covenants that would restrict our operational and financing flexibility Our ability to comply with this and other covenants contained in the revolving credit facility and our other consolidated indebtedness is subject to various risks and uncertainties including events beyond our control For example events that could cause a reduction in equity include without limitation a significant writedown of our goodwill Even if we are able to comply with this or other covenants the limitations on our operational and financial flexibility could harm our business by among other things limiting our ability to incur indebtedness or reduce equity in connection with financings or other corporate opportunities that we may believe would be in our best interests or the interests of our shareholders to complete Disruptions in the capital markets or changes in our credit ratings could also limit our ability to access capital on terms favorable to us or at all On January 2018 Moodys Investors Service changed its rating outlook from stable to negative for 24 regulated utilities and utility holding companies including us While the lending banks that participate in our revolving credit facility have met all of their obligations disruptions in the credit markets changes in our credit ratings or deterioration of the banking industrys financial condition could discourage or prevent lenders from meeting their existing lending commitments extending the terms of such commitments or agreeing to new commitments These or other occurrences may cause our lenders to not meet their existing commitments and we may not be able to access the commercial paper or loan or debt markets in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all Furthermore our inability to maintain renew or replace commitments under this facility could materially increase our cost of capital and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and liquidity Longerterm disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty including as a result of changes in US tax and other laws reduced financing alternatives or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to the liquidity needed for our business Any significant disruption in the capital debt or credit markets or financial institution failures could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the market stabilizes or until alternative financing can be arranged Such measures could include deferring capital expenditures reducing or suspending dividend payments and reducing other discretionary expenditures Any of the foregoing events that impede our access to the capital markets or the failure of any of our lenders to meet their commitments that result from financial market disruptions could expose us to increased interest expense require us to institute cash conservation measures or otherwise adversely and materially affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity American Water may be unable to meet its ongoing and future financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock if its subsidiaries are unable to pay upstream dividends or repay funds to American Water American Water is a holding company and as such American Water has no substantive operations of its own Substantially all of our consolidated assets are held by subsidiaries American Waters ability to meet its financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock is primarily dependent on the net income and cash flows of its subsidiaries and their ability to pay upstream dividends to American Water or repay indebtedness to American Water Prior to paying dividends to American Water American Waters regulated subsidiaries must comply with applicable regulatory restrictions and financial obligations including for example debt service and preferred and preference stock dividends as well as applicable corporate tax and other laws and regulations and agreements and covenants and other agreements made or entered into by American Water and its subsidiaries American Waters subsidiaries are separate legal entities and have no obligation to pay dividends to American Water A failure or inability of any of these subsidiaries to pay such dividends or repay intercompany obligations could have a material adverse impact on American Waters liquidity and its ability to pay dividends on its common stock and meet its other obligations 30 Table of Contents We may not be able to fully utilize our US and state net operating loss carryforwards As of December 31 2018  we had US federal and state NOL carryforwards of approximately 707 million and 547 million  respectively and management believes it is more likely than not that these NOL carryforwards will be recovered in the future With the enactment of the TCJA the Company analyzed the impacts of the reduction in the US federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 on the Companys deferred tax assets and liabilities including its NOL carryforwards and as a result remeasured those NOL carryforwards as of the date of enactment of the TCJA based on this tax rate change Our federal NOL carryforwards will begin to expire in 2028  and our state NOL carryforwards began to expire in 2019 and will continue to expire through 2037 We expect to fully utilize our federal NOL balance before it expires and our ability to do so is primarily dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient taxable income We have in the past been unable to utilize certain of our state NOL carryforwards and the establishment or increase of a valuation allowance in the future would reduce our deferred income tax assets and our net income Our actual results may differ from those estimated by management in making its assessment as to our ability to use the NOL carryforwards Moreover adoption of Related Interpretations with respect to the TCJA and other changes in income tax laws the economy and the general business environment could affect the future utilization of our NOL carryforwards If we are unable to fully utilize our NOL carryforwards to offset taxable income generated in the future our financial position results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected We have recorded a significant amount of goodwill and we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets causing us to record impairments that may negatively affect our results of operations Our total assets include 16 billion of goodwill at December 31 2018  The goodwill is primarily associated with the acquisition of American Water by an affiliate of our previous owner in 2003 the acquisition of Etown Corporation by a predecessor to our previous owner in 2001 the acquisition of Pivotal in 2018 and to a lesser extent the acquisition of Keystone in 2015 Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price the purchaser paid over the fair value of the net tangible and other intangible assets acquired Goodwill is recorded at fair value on the date of an acquisition and is reviewed annually or more frequently if changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable As required by the applicable accounting rules we have taken significant noncash charges to operating results for goodwill impairments in the past We may be required to recognize an impairment of goodwill in the future due to market conditions or other factors related to our performance or the performance of an acquired business These market conditions could include a decline over a period of time of our stock price a decline over a period of time in valuation multiples of comparable water utilities market price performance of our common stock that compares unfavorably to our peer companies decreases in control premiums or with respect to Keystone fluctuations in the level of exploration and production activities in the Marcellus and Utica shale regions served by Keystone a prolonged depression of natural gas prices or other factors that negatively impact our current or future forecasts of operating results cash flows or key assumptions In this regard in the third quarter of 2018 we strategically narrowed the scope of the Keystone business solely to water transfer services due to operational and financial challenges in the other businesses of Keystone As a result of this strategic change we recorded a noncash pretax impairment charge of 57 million in the third quarter of 2018 related to Keystone See Note 8Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information A decline in the results forecasted in our business plan due to events such as changes in rate case results capital investment budgets or interest rates could also result in an impairment charge Recognition of impairments of goodwill would result in a charge to income in the period in which the impairment occurred which may negatively affect our financial condition results of operations and total capitalization The effects of any such impairment could be material and could make it more difficult to maintain our credit ratings secure financing on attractive terms maintain compliance with debt covenants and meet the expectations of our regulators Market conditions may impact the value of benefit plan assets and liabilities as well as assumptions related to the benefit plans which may require us to provide significant additional funding The performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy significant future obligations under our pension and postretirement benefit plans The value of these assets is subject to market fluctuations which may cause investment returns to fall below our projected return rates A decline in the market value of the pension and postretirement benefit plan assets can increase the funding requirements under our pension and postretirement benefit plans Additionally our pension and postretirement benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates If interest rates decrease our liabilities would increase potentially increasing benefit expense and funding requirements Further changes in demographics such as increases in life expectancy assumptions and increasing trends in health care costs may also increase our funding requirements Future increases in pension and other postretirement costs as a result of reduced plan assets may not be fully recoverable in rates in which case our results of operations and financial position could be negatively affected 31 Table of Contents In addition market factors can affect assumptions we use in determining funding requirements with respect to our pension and postretirement plans For example a relatively modest change in our assumptions regarding discount rates can materially affect our calculation of funding requirements To the extent that market data compels us to reduce the discount rate used in our assumptions our benefit obligations could be materially increased which could adversely affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows New accounting standards or changes to existing accounting standards could materially impact how we report our results of operations cash flow and financial condition Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP The SEC the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other authoritative bodies or governmental entities may issue new pronouncements or new interpretations of existing accounting standards that may require us to change our accounting policies These changes are beyond our control can be difficult to predict and could materially impact how we report our results of operations cash flow and financial condition We could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively which could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow and financial condition Undetected errors in internal controls and information reporting could result in the disallowance of cost recovery and noncompliant disclosure Our internal controls accounting policies and practices and internal information systems are designed to enable us to capture and process transactions and information in a timely and accurate manner in compliance with GAAP taxation requirements federal securities laws and regulations and other laws and regulations applicable to us Such compliance permits us to among other things disclose and report financial and other information in connection with the recovery of our costs and with the reporting requirements under federal securities tax and other laws and regulations We have implemented corporate governance internal control and accounting policies and procedures in connection with the SarbanesOxley Act of 2002 the SarbanesOxley Act and relevant SEC rules as well as other applicable regulations Such internal controls and policies have been and continue to be closely monitored by our management and Board of Directors to ensure continued compliance with these laws rules and regulations Management is also responsible for establishing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting and is required to assess annually the effectiveness of these controls While we believe these controls policies practices and systems are adequate to verify data integrity unanticipated and unauthorized actions of employees or temporary lapses in internal controls due to shortfalls in oversight or resource constraints could lead to undetected errors that could result in the disallowance of cost recovery and noncompliant disclosure and reporting The consequences of these events could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition The inability of management to certify as to the effectiveness of these controls due to the identification of one or more material weaknesses in these controls could also increase financing costs or could also adversely affect our or AWCCs ability to access the capital markets Additional Risks Related to Our MarketBased Businesses We excluding our regulated subsidiaries provide performance guarantees with respect to certain obligations of our MarketBased Businesses  including financial guarantees or deposits to our publicsector and public clients and these clients may seek to enforce the guarantees if our MarketBased Businesses do not satisfy these obligations Under the terms of some of our agreements for the provision of services to water and wastewater facilities with municipalities other governmental entities and other customers American Water excluding our regulated subsidiaries provides guarantees of specified performance obligations of our MarketBased Businesses  including financial guarantees or deposits primarily related to Military Service Group In the event our MarketBased Businesses fail to perform these obligations the entity holding the guarantees may seek to enforce the performance commitments against us or proceed against the deposit In that event our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity could be adversely affected At December 31 2018  we had remaining performance commitments as measured by remaining contract revenue totaling approximately 43 billion related to our Military Services Group contracts and this amount is likely to increase if our MarketBased Businesses expand The presence of these commitments may adversely affect our financial condition and make it more difficult for us to secure financing on attractive terms 32 Table of Contents Our MarketBased Businesses operations under our Military Services Group are subject to various risks associated with doing business with the US government We enter into contracts with the US government for the operation and maintenance of water and wastewater systems which contracts may be terminated in whole or in part prior to the end of the 50year term for convenience of the US government or as a result of default or nonperformance by the subsidiary performing the contract In addition the contract price for each of these military contracts is typically subject to redetermination two years after commencement of operations and every three years thereafter Price redetermination is a contract mechanism to periodically adjust the service fee in the next period to reflect changes in contract obligations and anticipated market conditions Any early contract termination or unfavorable price redetermination could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows Moreover entering into contracts with the US government subjects us to a number of operational and compliance risks including dependence on the level of government spending and compliance with and changes in governmental procurement and security regulations We are subject to potential government investigations of our business practices and compliance with government procurement and security regulations which are complex and compliance with these regulations can be expensive and burdensome If we were charged with wrongdoing as a result of an investigation we could be suspended or barred from bidding on or receiving awards of new contracts with the US government or our existing contracts could be terminated which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows Our MarketBased Businesses under the Contract Services Group operate a limited number of water and wastewater systems under longterm OM contracts and face the risk that the owners of those systems may fail to provide capital to properly maintain those systems which may negatively affect the Contract Services Group as the operator of the systems and we may incur costs in excess of payments received The Contract Services Group operates a limited number of water and wastewater systems under OM contracts Pursuant to these contracts the Contract Services Group operates the system according to the standards set forth in the applicable contract and it is generally the responsibility of the owner of the system to undertake capital improvements In some cases the Contract Services Group may not be able to convince the owner to make needed improvements in order to maintain compliance with applicable regulations Although violations and fines incurred by water and wastewater systems may be the responsibility of the owner of the system under these contracts those noncompliance events may reflect poorly on the Contract Services Group as the operator of the system and us and damage our reputation and in some cases may result in liability to us to the same extent as if we were the owner In addition the Contract Services Group has entered into longterm contracts under which they agree to operate and maintain a municipalitys or other partys water or wastewater treatment and delivery facilities which includes specified major maintenance for some of those facilities in exchange for an annual fee The Contract Services Group is generally subject to the risk that costs associated with operating and maintaining the facilities including production costs such as purchased water electricity fuel and chemicals used in water treatment may exceed the fees received from the municipality or other contracting party Losses under these contracts or guarantees may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity Keystones operations may expose us to substantial costs and liabilities with respect to environmental laws and matters Keystones operations and the operation generally of natural gas and oil exploration and production facilities by Keystones customers are subject to stringent federal state and local laws rules regulations and ordinances governing the release of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection These provisions may require the acquisition by Keystone of permits or licenses before providing its services to customers prohibit the release of substances defined thereunder as hazardous in connection with these activities and impose substantial liabilities for the violation thereof that may result from these operations Failure to comply with these laws rules regulations and ordinances may result in substantial environmental remediation and other costs to Keystone the assessment of administrative civil and criminal penalties or the issuance of injunctions restricting or prohibiting certain activities Under existing environmental laws and regulations Keystone could be held strictly liable for the removal or remediation of previously released materials or property contamination regardless of whether the release resulted from its operations or whether its operations were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time they were performed While we have structured and maintained our ownership and control of Keystones operations in such a way that we believe should insulate the Company its regulated subsidiaries and its other MarketBased Businesses from any liabilities associated with Keystones operations including liabilities for environmental matters there can be no assurance that such efforts will be sufficient to prevent the Company from incurring liability for the operations of Keystone Changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently and any changes to these or other laws governing the natural gas and oil exploration industry that result in more stringent or costly water or wastewater handling storage transport disposal or cleanup requirements could require Keystone to make significant expenditures to maintain compliance with such requirements may harm Keystones business and results of operations by reducing the demand for Keystones water and related services and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on Keystones competitive position financial condition results of operations and cash flows 33 ITEM 1B UNRESOLVED

wastewater industry practice ITEM 3 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Alternative Water Supply in Lieu of Carmel River Diversions Compliance with SWRCB Orders to Reduce Carmel River Diversions Under the 2009 Order Cal Am is required among other things to decrease significantly its yearly diversions of water from the Carmel River according to a set reduction schedule The 2009 Order responded to claims that Cal Am had not sufficiently implemented actions to terminate its unpermitted diversions of water from the Carmel River as required by a 1995 order of the SWRCB In July 2016 at the request of Cal Am and several Monterey County government agencies the SWRCB issued the 2016 Order approving a fiveyear extension of the deadline to comply with the 2009 Order to December 31 2021 34 Table of Contents The 2009 Order includes a condition prohibiting Cal Am from diverting water from the Carmel River for new service connections or for any increased use of water at existing service addresses resulting from a change in zoning or use In 2011 the California Public Utilities Commission the CPUC issued a decision directing modifications in Cal Ams tariffs to recognize the moratorium mandated by the 2009 Order and directing Cal Am to seek written guidance from the SWRCB with respect to any unresolved issues of interpretation or implementation of this condition In 2012 the Deputy Director of the SWRCB sent a letter to Cal Am providing an interpretation as to the calculation of a baseline to determine increases in use of water at existing service addresses On March 19 2018 the MPWMD adopted a resolution directing Cal Am to interpret the baseline in a manner that conflicts with the SWRCBs written interpretation On May 4 2018 Cal Am notified the MPWMD and the SWRCB that it intends to seek declaratory relief concerning the conflicting regulatory interpretations under the 2009 Order In an attempt to resolve these conflicting interpretations prior to seeking judicial intervention Cal Am met with the MPWMD and the SWRCB several times The SWRCB has circulated revisions to its 2012 interpretive letter which are being reviewed and discussed by the parties Any failure to follow the MPWMDs resolution or the SWRCBs written interpretation despite these conflicting interpretations could potentially result in fines penalties and other actions against Cal Am The 2016 Order provides that if the CPUC authorizes Cal Am to acquire more than 1000 acrefeet per year of water from a source other than the Water Supply Project proponents of the alternative water source could submit revised milestones to the SWRCB for consideration On May 8 2018 certain parties to the Water Supply Project proceeding submitted a petition to the SWRCB to add parallel milestones to the 2009 Order for 2019 2020 and 2021 based on the proposed expansion of the Pure Water Monterey project another groundwater replenishment project under construction on the Monterey peninsula Petitioners claim that compliance with the alternate milestones would still provide for cessation of Cal Ams unauthorized diversions from the Carmel River by 2021 A preliminary report on feasibility concluded that the expanded Pure Water Monterey project could provide an additional 2250 acrefeet of water per year Cal Am believes that i the petition is premature ii the expanded Pure Water Monterey project is not yet a sufficiently certain or reliable water supply and even if construction is successfully completed would provide an insufficient quantity of water to allow full compliance with the 2009 Order and iii the imposition of parallel milestones would distract from completion of the Water Supply Project This petition remains pending Regional Desalination Project Litigation Review of CPUCApproved Settlement Agreement The Regional Desalination Project the RDP involved the construction of a desalination facility in the City of Marina north of Monterey The RDP was intended to among other things eliminate unauthorized diversions from the Carmel River as required under the 2009 Order In December 2010 the CPUC approved the RDP which was to be implemented through a Water Purchase Agreement and ancillary agreements collectively the Agreements among the Marina Coast Water District MCWD the Monterey County Water Resources Agency MCWRA and Cal Am In 2011 due to a conflict of interest concerning a former member of MCWRAs Board of Directors MCWRA stated that the Agreements were void and as a result Cal Am terminated the Agreements In April 2015 the CPUC approved a settlement agreement among Cal Am MCWRA and the County of Monterey to resolve these matters among the parties signing the agreement In March 2016 the Supreme Court of California granted MCWDs petition for review of the CPUC approval and following the courts disposition of a related issue in another case MCWDs petition for review of the CPUCapproved settlement agreement was remanded to the CPUC and remains pending Cal Ams Action for Damages Following RDP Termination In October 2012 Cal Am filed a Complaint for Declaratory Relief against MCWRA and MCWD which was ultimately transferred to the San Francisco County Superior Court seeking a determination as to whether the Agreements are void as a result of the alleged conflict of interest In June 2015 the court entered a final judgment agreeing with Cal Ams position that four of the five Agreements are void and one the credit line agreement is not void In November 2016 the Supreme Court of California denied MCWDs final appeal of this judgment which allows further proceedings discussed below to determine the amount of damages that may be awarded in the proceeding In July 2015 Cal Am and MCWRA filed a Complaint in San Francisco County Superior Court against MCWD and RMC Water and Environment RMC a private engineering consulting firm seeking to recover compensatory damages in excess of 10 million associated with the failure of the RDP as well as punitive and treble damages statutory penalties and attorneys fees Shortly thereafter complaints seeking similar damages were filed in the same court by MCWD and RMC against Cal Am and MCWRA in excess of 19 million in the aggregate In December 2015 the court consolidated all of these complaints into a single action Trial in the consolidated action currently remains set for March 25 2019 in San Francisco County Superior Court 35 Table of Contents Monterey Peninsula Water Supply Project CPUC Final Approval of Water Supply Project The Water Supply Project is intended to reduce water diversions from the Carmel River and involves construction of a desalination plant owned by Cal Am and purchase of water by Cal Am from a groundwater replenishment project the GWR Project between the Monterey Regional Water Pollution Control Agency and the MPWMD Cal Ams ability to move forward on the Water Supply Project is and has been subject to extensive administrative review by the CPUC and other government agencies obtaining necessary permits and intervention from other parties In September 2016 the CPUC unanimously approved a decision to authorize Cal Am to enter into a water purchase agreement for the GWR Project and to construct a pipeline and pump station facilities and recover up to 50 million in associated costs subject to meeting certain criteria If construction costs exceed 50 million Cal Am would be allowed to seek additional cost recovery On August 13 2018 the CPUC issued its proposed decision granting Cal Ams request for a CPCN for a 64 million gallons per day desalination plant certifying the final Environmental Impact ReportEnvironmental Impact Statement EIREIS and denying all other outstanding motions On September 13 2018 the CPUC unanimously adopted a final decision i finding that the Water Supply Project meets the CPUCs requirements for a CPCN and ii finding that a the issuance of the final decision should not be delayed and b an additional procedural phase was not necessary to consider alternative projects The CPUCs decision directs Cal Am to enter into negotiations regarding expansion of the GWR Project between the Monterey Regional Water Pollution Control Agency and the MPWMD and to indicate whether Cal Am plans to file an application for approval of an agreement to purchase additional water from the GWR Project The decision notes however that the CPUC will only consider such an application if the Water Supply Project is delayed such that Cal Am would not be able to meet the December 31 2021 deadline to comply with the 2009 Order The decision accepts Cal Ams estimates of future water demand in Monterey and concludes that the Water Supply Project is the best project to address those needs and adopts Cal Ams most recent cost estimates The decision also allows Cal Am to earn an allowance for funds used during construction or AFUDC at a rate representative of its actual financing costs The final decision adopted frameworks as to cost caps OM costs financing ratemaking and contingency matters In addition the CPUC final decision imposes numerous reporting and filing requirements to ensure the expenditures for the Water Supply Project are reasonable including that the financing is the lowest cost and most beneficial for ratepayers and that construction is progressing in a timely manner and within the authorized cost caps The reasonableness of Water Supply Project costs will be reviewed in the first general rate case filed by Cal Am after the Water Supply Project becomes operational Cal Am is also required to implement mitigation measures to avoid minimize or offset significant environmental impacts from the construction and operation of the Water Supply Project and comply with a mitigation monitoring and reporting program a reimbursement agreement for CPUC costs associated with that program and reporting requirements on plant operations following placement of the Water Supply Project in service Consistent with that decision on December 31 2018 Cal Am sought adjustments to certain financing and ratemaking provisions including the timing and amount of surcharge recovery and addressed related implementation issues On October 19 2018 MCWD and the City of Marina filed applications for rehearing before the CPUC Cal Am filed its response to the applications for rehearing on November 5 2018 On January 31 2019 the CPUC denied these applications for rehearing On October 12 2018 MCWD and the City of Marina filed petitions for writ of review in the Supreme Court of California challenging the sufficiency of the final EIREIS On December 12 2018 the Supreme Court of California denied the petitions for writ of review without prejudice to the filing of renewed submissions upon completion of the rehearing proceedings pending before the CPUC The City of Marina and MCWD filed their renewed petitions for writ of review on January 16 2019 and January 17 2019 respectively Coastal Development Permit Application On June 22 2018 Cal Am submitted a coastal development permit application to the City of Marina for those project components of the Water Supply Project located within the City of Marinas coastal zone Members of the Citys Planning Commission as well as City councilpersons have publicly expressed opposition to the Water Supply Project On August 9 2018 the City deemed Cal Ams application incomplete pending certification and submission of the final environmental impact report and stated that the City could not rule on the permit until certification As noted above the CPUC certified the final EIREIS for the Water Supply Project on September 13 2018 A public hearing before the Planning Commission on Cal Ams application was held on February 14 2019 and the Planning Commission voted to direct staff to prepare findings supporting a denial of the application The Planning Commission continued the hearing until March 7 2019 at which time it is expected to take formal action on the application 36 Table of Contents Proposed Zoning Changes at Cemex Site for Slant Wells On August 30 2018 the City circulated a public review draft of proposed amendments to its local coastal program and zoning ordinance and placed the matter for consideration on the Planning Commissions agenda for its September 13 2018 meeting The proposed amendments would change zoning at the Cemex site to open space and restrict future uses including with respect to Cal Ams planned use of the site for the slant wells for the Water Supply Project Any change to the Citys local coastal program must ultimately be approved by the California Coastal Commission the Coastal Commission Cal Am Cemex and the Coastal Commission each submitted letters opposing the proposed amendments At its November 8 2018 meeting the Planning Commission adopted a resolution recommending that the Marina City Council consider approving the amendments On December 4 2018 the Marina City Council considered the proposed amendments Cal Am Cemex and the Coastal Commission again submitted letters opposing the proposed changes but the City Council unanimously adopted a resolution amending its local coastal plan and a draft amendment to its zoning ordinance Changes to the ordinance require a second reading before becoming final which occurred at the Citys December 18 2018 meeting The changes to the local coastal plan must be submitted to the Coastal Commission for approval and are not effective until such approval is obtained Test Slant Well Permitting A preliminary step to building the Water Supply Project desalination plant is the construction and operation of a test slant well to confirm the suitability of the property on which intake wells will be located to draw water from under Monterey Bay In November 2014 the Coastal Commission approved coastal development permits for the test slant well enabling Cal Am to construct and operate the test slant well The Coastal Commission has approved permit amendments to allow the test slant well to remain and place and be maintained until February 28 2020 A required lease obtained from the California State Lands Commission as amended will expire on December 16 2019 Effective February 28 2018 test slant well pumping ceased except for minimal maintenance pumping activities in accordance with Cal Ams coastal development permits In November 2015 MCWD filed a Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief in Santa Cruz County Superior Court against the Coastal Commission and Cal Am challenging the amendment of the coastal development permits and seeking an injunction against further test well pumping In orders issued in September 2016 and October 2017 the court denied
