PART I ITEM 1 BUSINESS The Company With a history dating back to 1886  American Water is the largest and most geographically diverse publiclytraded water and wastewater utility company in the United States as measured by both operating revenues and population served A holding company originally incorporated in Delaware in 1936  the Company employs approximately 6800 professionals who provide drinking water wastewater and other related services to approximately 15 million people in 46 states The Company conducts the majority of its business through regulated utilities that provide water and wastewater services collectively presented as the  Regulated Businesses  The Company also operates marketbased businesses that provide complementary services Individually these businesses do not meet the criteria of a reportable segment in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States GAAP and are collectively presented as the  MarketBased Businesses  which is consistent with how management assesses the results of these businesses Throughout this Form 10K unless the context otherwise requires references to we us our the Company and American Water mean American Water Works Company Inc and its subsidiaries taken together as a whole References to parent company mean American Water Works Company Inc without its subsidiaries Regulated Businesses The Companys primary business involves the ownership of utilities that provide water and wastewater services to residential commercial industrial public authority fire service and sale for resale customers The Companys utilities operate in approximately 1700 communities in 16 states in the United States with over 34 million active customers in its water and wastewater networks Services provided by the Companys utilities are subject to regulation by multiple state utility commissions or other entities engaged in utility regulation collectively referred to as public utility commissions PUCs Federal state and local governments also regulate environmental health and safety and water quality matters The Company reports the results of the services provided by its utilities in the Regulated Businesses segment Operating revenues for the Regulated Businesses were 3094 million for 2019  2984 million for 2018 and 2958 million for 2017  accounting for 86  87 and 88  respectively of the Companys total operating revenues for the same periods Presented in the table below is a geographic summary of the Regulated Businesses  operating revenues and the number of

and Virginia Customers The Companys Regulated Businesses have a large and geographically diverse customer base A customer is defined as a person business municipality or any other entity that purchases the Companys water or wastewater services as of the last business day of a reporting period One single customer may purchase the Companys services for use by multiple individuals or businesses such as homes apartment complexes businesses and governmental entities 4 Table of Contents The vast majority of the Companys regulated water customers are metered which allows the Company to measure and bill for its customers water usage typically on a monthly basis The Company employs a variety of methods of customer meter reading to monitor consumption These methods range from meters with mechanical registers where consumption is manually recorded by meter readers to meters with electronic registers capable of transmitting consumption data to proximity devices or via radio frequency to mobile or fixed network data collectors The Companys wastewater customers are billed either a flat rate or based upon their water consumption Residential customers make up a substantial portion of the Companys customer base in all of the states in which it operates The Company also serves i commercial customers such as food and beverage providers commercial property developers and proprietors and energy suppliers ii fire service customers where the Company supplies water through its distribution systems to public fire hydrants for firefighting purposes and to private fire customers for use in fire suppression systems in office buildings and other facilities iii industrial customers such as largescale manufacturers mining and production operations iv public authorities such as government buildings and other public sector facilities including schools and universities and v other utilities and community water and wastewater systems in the form of bulk contracts for the supply of water or the treatment of wastewater for their own customers The following chart depicts the allocation of the Companys Regulated Businesses  operating revenue of 3094 million by type including a breakout of the total water services revenues by class of customer for the year ended December 31 2019  a Includes water revenues from public authorities and other utilities and community

Customer growth in the Companys Regulated Businesses is primarily from i adding new customers to its customer base through acquisitions of water andor wastewater utility systems ii population growth in its authorized service areas and iii sale of water to other water utilities and community water systems Capital Investment Excluding acquisitions the Company plans to invest 82 billion over the next five years and between 18 billion and 19 billion over the next 10 years including 16 billion in 2020  for capital improvements to its Regulated Businesses  water and wastewater infrastructure largely for pipe replacement and upgrading aging water and wastewater treatment facilities The Company has proactively improved its pipe renewal rate from a 250year replacement cycle in 2009 to an expected 115year replacement cycle by 2024 which it anticipates will enable the Company to replace nearly 2000 miles of mains and collection pipes between 2020 and 2024 In addition from 2020 to 2024 the Companys capital investment in treatment plants storage tanks and other key aboveground facilities is expected to increase further addressing infrastructure renewal resiliency water quality operational efficiency technology and innovation and emerging regulatory compliance needs Additionally the Company is investing significantly in resiliency projects to address the impacts of climate and weather variability by hardening its assets Recently completed projects include the 25 million raised floodwall project at New Jerseys Raritan Millstone Water Treatment Plant which provides protection against a 500 year flood and the 15 million Bel Air Maryland Reservoir project which provides 90 million gallons of drought mitigation water storage for the region Regulation and Rate Making The operations of the Companys Regulated Businesses are generally subject to regulation by PUCs in the states in which they operate with the primary responsibility of the PUCs to promote the overall public interest by balancing the interest of customers and utility investors Specific authority might differ from state to state but in most states PUCs review and approve rates charged to customers accounting treatments longterm financing programs and cost of capital operation and maintenance OM expenses capital expenditures taxes affiliated transactions and relationships reorganizations and mergers and acquisitions along with imposing certain penalties or granting certain incentives Regulatory policies vary from state to state and could potentially change over time These policies will affect the timing as well as the extent of recovery of expenses and the realized return on invested capital Periodic changes in customer rates generally occur through the filing of a rate case by the utility with the PUC The timing of rate case filings is typically determined by either periodic requirements in the regulatory jurisdiction or by the utilitys need to increase its revenue requirement to recover capital investment costs changes in operating revenues operating costs or other market conditions The Company attempts to minimize regulatory lag which is the time between the occurrence of an event that triggers a change in the utilitys revenue requirement and its recognition in rates 6 Table of Contents The Companys Regulated Businesses support regulatory practices at the PUCs and state legislatures that mitigate the adverse impact of regulatory lag Presented in the table below are examples of approved regulatory practices Regulatory Practices Description States Allowed Infrastructure replacement surcharges Allows rates to change periodically outside a general rate case proceeding to reflect recovery of capital investments made to replace infrastructure necessary to sustain safe reliable services for the Companys customers These mechanisms typically involve periodic filings and reviews to ensure transparency IA IL IN KY MO NJ NY PA TN VA WV Future test year A test period used for setting rates which begins with the date new rates are effective This allows current or projected revenues expenses and capital investments to be collected on a more timely basis CA HI IA IL IN KY NY PA TN VA Hybrid test year Allows an update to historical data for known and measurable changes that occur subsequent to the historical test year MD MO NJ WV Utility plant recovery mechanisms Allows recovery of the full return on utility plant costs during the construction period instead of capitalizing an allowance for funds used during construction In addition some states allow the utility to seek preapproval of certain capital projects and associated costs In this preapproval process the PUC may assess the prudency of such projects CA IL KY NY PA TN VA Expense mechanisms Allows changes in certain operating expenses which may fluctuate based on conditions beyond the utilitys control to be recovered outside of a general rate case proceeding or deferred until the next general rate case proceeding CA IL MD MO NJ NY PA TN VA Revenue stability mechanisms Separates a utilitys cost recovery from the amount of water it sells to recover its fixed costs and ongoing infrastructure investment needs Such a mechanism adjusts rates periodically to ensure that a utilitys revenue will be sufficient to cover its costs regardless of sales volume including recognition of declining sales resulting from reduced consumption while providing an incentive for customers to use water more efficiently CA IL NY Consolidated tariffs Use of a unified rate structure for water systems owned and operated by a single utility which may or may not be physically interconnected The consolidated tariff pricing structure may be used fully or partially in a state and is generally used to prioritize capital investments and moderate the impact of periodic fluctuations in local costs while lowering administrative costs for customers Pennsylvania also permits a blending of water and wastewater revenue requirements CA IA IL IN KY MD MO NJ NY PA VA WV The Company pursues enhancement to these regulatory practices to facilitate efficient recovery of its costs and capital investments in order to continue to provide safe clean reliable and affordable services to its customers The ability to seek regulatory treatment as described above does not guarantee that the PUCs will accept the Companys proposal in the context of a particular rate case and these regulatory practices may reduce but not eliminate regulatory lag associated with traditional rate making processes It is also the Companys strategy to expand the use of these mechanisms in areas where they may not currently apply Acquisitions and Strategic Growth The US water and wastewater industries include investorowned systems as well as municipal systems that are owned and operated by local governments or governmental subdivisions According to the US Environmental Protection Agency EPA as of 2017 approximately 84 of the water market is served by municipal systems and approximately 98 of the countrys wastewater systems are government owned The EPA also estimates that there are approximately 50000 community water systems and approximately 15000 community wastewater systems in the United States with approximately 80 of the community water systems serving a population of 3000 or less A fundamental aspect of the Companys growth strategy is to pursue acquisitions of small and medium water andor wastewater systems in geographic proximity to areas where the Company operates its Regulated Businesses  The proximity of acquisition opportunities to the Companys regulated footprint allows it to integrate and manage the acquired systems and operations primarily using its existing management although the Company typically retains the majority if not all of the employees and to achieve operational efficiencies and prioritize capital investment needs The Companys current customer mix of 93 water and 7 wastewater also presents strategic opportunities for wastewater growth and systems consolidation allowing it to add wastewater customers where the Company already serves water customers The Company intends to continue to expand its regulated footprint geographically by acquiring water and wastewater systems in its existing markets and if appropriate pursuing acquisition opportunities in certain domestic markets where the Company does not currently operate its Regulated Businesses  Before entering new regulated markets the Company will evaluate the business and regulatory climates to ensure that it will have the opportunity to achieve an appropriate rate of return on its investment while maintaining its high standards for providing safe reliable and affordable services to its customers as well as a line of sight to grow the Companys base customers to attain efficiencies after entering the new domestic market Increasingly stringent environmental health and safety and water quality regulations the amount of infrastructure in need of significant capital investment financial challenges and industry legislation are several elements that may drive more municipalities to consider selling their water and wastewater assets 7 Table of Contents Industry Legislation In 2017 New Jersey enacted the Water Quality Accountability Act the WQAA which sets operational standards for all water utilities in New Jersey including municipal and investorowned utilities with more than 500 service connections This law imposes requirements in areas such as cybersecurity asset management water quality reporting remediation of notices of violation and hydrant and valve maintenance The WQAA requires the most senior water manager or either the executive director for municipal utility authorities or the mayor or chief executive officer for municipally owned public water systems to certify that the system meets the requirements under the WQAA In 2019 the New Jersey Senate held three hearings on the WQAA and is expected to introduce legislation in the new 2020 legislative session that would strengthen accountability for obligations under the WQAA In 2018 similar legislation was passed in Indiana that set new operational requirements for water and wastewater treatment plants as part of the permitting process for construction installation or modification of sources facilities equipment or devices These requirements include capital asset management plans that include annual reviews of infrastructure needs engineering analysis of useful life and a rate analysis to support the capital asset management plan A life cycle costbenefit analysis must be done comparing owning and operating a plant to other alternatives to supply water or wastewater services Cybersecurity plans must also be developed In 2019 additional legislation was passed which set requirements for access to loans or grants such as participation in regional planning events use of current capital asset management programs and elimination of the causes of nonrevenue water The finance authority was also required to establish project prioritization that included consideration of project effects on public health and safety user rates and charges plans for collaboration plans to manage nonrevenue water and use of best practices Also in 2018 Americas Water Infrastructure Act of 2018 was signed into law The legislation includes policies intended to improve water and wastewater system management and authorization for states to assess consolidation options for systems that do not comply with the federal Safe Drinking Water Act and its rules and regulations The legislation increases funding to water system funding programs including the State Revolving Loan Fund program and the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act of 2014 WIFIA The Companys regulated subsidiaries in California Illinois Indiana Iowa Maryland Missouri New Jersey and Pennsylvania have access to fair market value legislation for private sector investment in public sector water and wastewater systems The Company supports full optionality for municipalities including state legislation that enables the consolidation of the largely fragmented water and wastewater industries through thirdparty fair market valuations of purchased property Fair market value assessment of water and wastewater systems is an alternative to the traditional depreciated original cost method of valuation providing municipalities with a purchase price that is reflective of the assets market value while the utility has increased assurance of recovering the purchase price over the life of the assets subject to state regulatory commission approval Consolidated tariffs use a unified rate structure for systems owned and operated by a single utility which may or may not be physically interconnected Consolidated tariff pricing moderates the impact of periodic fluctuations in local costs and promotes a more universal water infrastructure investment in the state As a result consolidated tariffs can make it easier to incorporate new systems into an existing utility and can ensure economies of scale for even the smallest of systems and prioritize capital needs across the state Overall this brings costeffective higher quality services to a larger number of citizens Twelve of the Companys regulated jurisdictions currently have some form of consolidated tariff pricing including California Illinois Indiana Iowa Kentucky Maryland Missouri New Jersey New York Pennsylvania Virginia and West Virginia In 2018 legislation was enacted in the Companys Missouri and California subsidiaries changing the public vote requirement for the sale of water or wastewater systems In Missouri the public vote requirement for the sale of a municipal water or wastewater system changed to a simple majority for more than 500 small towns Historically only larger communities required a simple majority while smaller communities needed a twothirds majority This legislation increases the options for small towns should they decide to address their water and sewer challenges through an asset sale In California the vote required to allow cities to sell sewer systems changed to a simple majority from a twothirds majority Competition The Companys Regulated Businesses generally do not face direct competition in their existing markets because i the Company operates in those markets pursuant to franchises charters certificates of public convenience and necessity or similar authorizations collectively CPCNs issued by state PUCs or other authorities and ii the high cost of constructing a new water and wastewater system in an existing market creates a significant barrier to market entry However the Companys Regulated Businesses do face competition from governmental agencies other investorowned utilities large industrial customers with the ability to provide their own water supplytreatment process and strategic buyers that are entering new markets andor making strategic acquisitions When pursuing acquisitions the Companys largest investorowned competitors based on a comparison of operating revenues and population served are Essential Utilities Inc formerly known as Aqua America Inc Suez North America American States Water Company and California Water Service Group From time to time the Company also faces competition from infrastructure funds multiutility companies and others such as Algonquin Power and Utilities Corp Eversource Energy and Corix 8 Table of Contents Condemnation and Eminent Domain All or portions of the Regulated Businesses  utility assets could be acquired by state municipal or other government entities through one or more of the following methods i eminent domain also known as condemnation ii the right of purchase given or reserved by a municipality or political subdivision when the original CPCN was granted and iii the right of purchase given or reserved under the law of the state in which the utility subsidiary was incorporated or from which it received its CPCN The acquisition consideration related to such a proceeding initiated by a local government may be determined consistent with applicable eminent domain law or may be negotiated or fixed by appraisers as prescribed by the law of the state or in the particular CPCN As such the Regulated Businesses are periodically subject to condemnation proceedings in the ordinary course of business For example a citizens group in Monterey California successfully added Measure J to the November 2018 election ballot asking voters to decide whether the Monterey Peninsula Water Management District the MPWMD should conduct a feasibility study concerning the potential purchase of the Monterey water service system assets the Monterey system assets of the Companys California subsidiary and if feasible to proceed with a purchase of those assets without an additional public vote This service territory represents approximately 40000 customers In November 2018 Measure J was certified to have passed On August 19 2019 the MPWMDs General Manager issued a report that recommends that the MPWMD board 1 develop criteria to determine which water systems should be considered for acquisition 2 examine the feasibility of acquiring the Monterey system assets and consider public ownership of smaller systems only if the MPWMD becomes the owner of a larger system 3 evaluate whether it is in the public interest to acquire the Monterey system assets and sufficiently satisfy the criterion of feasible as provided in Measure J 4 ensure there is significant potential for cost savings before agreeing to commence an acquisition and 5 develop more fully alternate operating plans before deciding whether to consider a Resolution of Necessity On November 6 2019 the MPWMD issued a preliminary valuation and cost of service analysis report finding in part that 1 an estimate of the Monterey system assets total value plus adjustments would be approximately 513 million 2 the cost of service modeling results indicate significant annual reductions in revenue requirements and projected monthly water bills and 3 the acquisition of the Monterey system assets by the MPWMD would be economically feasible The MPWMD will hold public hearings regarding the findings contained in this preliminary report If the MPWMD were to make a final determination that an acquisition of the Monterey system assets is feasible then the MPWMD would commence a multiyear eminent domain proceeding against the Companys California subsidiary to first establish the MPWMDs right to take the Monterey system assets and if such right is established to determine the amount of just compensation to be paid to the California subsidiary for such assets Also five municipalities in the Chicago Illinois area approximately 30300 customers in total formed a water agency and filed an eminent domain lawsuit against the Companys Illinois subsidiary in January 2013 seeking to condemn the water pipeline that serves those five municipalities Before filing its eminent domain lawsuit the water agency made an offer of 38 million for the pipeline A jury trial will take place to establish the value of the pipeline The parties have filed with the court updated valuation reports Although the date of the valuation trial has not currently been scheduled it is not likely to commence before the second quarter of 2020 Furthermore the law in certain jurisdictions in which the Regulated Businesses operate provides for eminent domain rights allowing private property owners to file a lawsuit to seek just compensation against a public utility if a public utilitys infrastructure has been determined to be a substantial cause of damage to that property In these actions the plaintiff would not have to prove that the public utility acted negligently In California lawsuits have been filed in connection with largescale natural events such as wildfires Some have included allegations that infrastructure of certain utilities triggered the natural event that resulted in damage to the property In some cases the PUC has allowed certain costs or losses incurred by the utility to be recovered from customers in rates but in other cases such recovery in rates has been disallowed Also the utility may have obtained insurance that could respond to some or all of such losses although the utility would be at risk for any losses not ultimately subject to rate or insurance recovery or losses that exceed the limits of such insurance Water Supply and Wastewater Services The Companys Regulated Businesses generally own the physical assets used to store pump treat and deliver water to its customers and collect treat transport and recycle wastewater Typically the Company does not own the water which is held in public trust and is allocated to the Company through contracts permits and allocation rights granted by federal and state or multistate agencies or through the ownership of water rights pursuant to local law The Company is dependent on defined sources of water supply and obtains its water supply from surface water sources such as reservoirs lakes rivers and streams from groundwater sources such as wells and aquifers and water purchased from thirdparty water suppliers The level of water treatment the Company applies varies significantly depending upon the quality of the water source and customer stipulations Surface water sources typically generally require significant treatment while groundwater sources often require chemical treatment only 9 Table of Contents Presented in the chart below are the Companys sources of water supply as of December 31 2019  Presented in the table below are the percentages of water supply by source type for the Companys top seven states for 2019  Surface Water Ground Water Purchased Water New Jersey 72 24 4 Pennsylvania 91 7 2 Missouri 77 22 1 Illinois 55 35 10 California  64 36 Indiana 44 56  West Virginia 100   The Companys ability to meet the existing and future water demands of its customers depends on an adequate water supply Drought governmental restrictions overuse of sources of water the protection of threatened species or habitats contamination or other factors may limit the availability of ground and surface water The Company employs a variety of measures in an effort to obtain adequate sources of water supply both in the shortterm and over the longterm The geographic diversity of the Companys service areas may mitigate some of the economic effects on the water supply associated with weather extremes it might encounter in any particular service territory For example in any given summer some areas may experience drier than average weather which may reduce the amount of source water available while other areas the Company serves may experience wetter than average weather 10 Table of Contents The Company evaluates quality quantity growth needs and alternate sources of water supply as well as transmission and distribution capacity Water supply is seasonal in nature and weather conditions can have a pronounced effect on supply In order to ensure that the Company has adequate water supply it uses longterm planning processes and maintains contingency plans to minimize the potential impact on service caused by climate variability and a wide range of weather fluctuations In connection with supply planning for most surface or groundwater sources the Company employs models to determine safe yields under different rainfall and drought conditions Surface and ground water levels are routinely monitored so that supply capacity deficits may to the extent possible be predicted and mitigated through demand management and additional supply development An example of the Companys use of longterm planning to ensure that it has adequate water supply is its involvement in the Monterey Peninsula Water Supply Project the Water Supply Project in California The Water Supply Project includes the construction of a desalination plant owned by the Companys California subsidiary and the construction of wells that would supply water to the desalination plant In addition the Water Supply Project also includes the California subsidiarys purchase of water from a groundwater replenishment project the GWR Project between Monterey One Water formerly known as the Monterey Regional Water Pollution Control Agency and the MPWMD The Water Supply Project is intended among other things to fulfill obligations of the California subsidiary to eliminate unauthorized diversions from the Carmel River as required under orders of the California State Water Resources Control Board the SWRCB For more information see Item 3Legal Proceedings Alternative Water Supply in Lieu of Carmel River Diversions Wastewater services involve the collection of wastewater from customers premises through sewer lines The wastewater is then transported through a sewer network to a treatment facility where it is treated to meet required regulatory standards for wastewater before being returned to the environment The solid waste byproduct of the treatment process is disposed of or recycled in accordance with applicable standards and regulations Seasonality Customer demand for the Companys water service is affected by weather and tends to vary with temperature and amount and frequency of rainfall Customer demand is generally greater during the warmer months primarily due to increased water usage for irrigation systems and other outdoor water use As such the Company typically expects its operating revenues to be the highest in the third quarter of each year Weather that is hotter andor drier than average generally increases operating revenues whereas weather that is cooler andor wetter than average generally serves to suppress customer water demand and can reduce water operating revenues Three of the Companys jurisdictions California Illinois and New York have adopted revenue stability mechanisms which permit the Company to collect state PUCauthorized revenue for a given period which is not tied to the volume of water sold during that period thereby lessening the impact of weather variability See  Regulation and Rate Making  for additional information regarding revenue stability mechanisms MarketBased Businesses The Companys MarketBased Businesses provide complementary home services primarily to residential and smaller commercial customers and water and wastewater services to the US government on military installations as well as municipalities utilities and industrial customers These businesses are not subject to regulation by state PUCs and the services provided generally do not require significant capital investment Operating revenues for the Companys MarketBased Businesses were 539 million for 2019  476 million for 2018 and 422 million for 2017  accounting for 15  14 and 13  respectively of the Companys total operating revenues for the same periods The Companys primary MarketBased Businesses include the following operating segments  Homeowner Services Group HOS which provides various warranty protection programs and other home services to residential customers  Military Services Group MSG which enters into longterm contracts with the US government to provide water and wastewater services on various military installations The Company also has five contracts with municipal customers to operate and manage water and wastewater facilities and provide other related services through its Contract Services Group  CSG  Previously the Company provided customized water transfer services for shale natural gas exploration and production companies through its Keystone Clearwater Solutions LLC Keystone operations On December 12 2019  as part of a strategic review undertaken by the Company the Company sold all of its interest in Keystone to a natural gas and oil industry investment group See Note 4Acquisitions and Divestitures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information 11 Table of Contents Homeowner Services Group The Companys Homeowner Services Group  which includes the operations of Pivotal Home Solutions Pivotal acquired in June 2018 provides warranty protection programs and other home services to residential customers for interior and exterior water and sewer lines interior gas and electric lines heating and cooling systems water heaters and other home appliances as well as power surge protection and other related services The Company develops partnerships with municipalities utilities and other organizations to offer protection programs to customers serviced by or affiliated with those municipalities utilities and organizations The term of these partnership agreements with the municipalities utilities and other organizations is typically three to five years with mutual optional renewals As of December 31 2019  HOS had approximately 3 million customer contracts in 43 states Military Services Group The Companys Military Services Group operates on 16 military installations under 50year contracts with the US government as part of its Utility Privatization Program The scope of these contracts generally includes the operation and maintenance of the installations water and wastewater systems and a capital program focused on asset replacement and in certain instances systems expansion The replacement of assets assumed when a contract is awarded to the Company is completed either through a discrete set of projects executed in the first five years of the contract or through the long term recapitalization program performed over the life of the contract Traditionally both of these programs are funded from the contract fee At times new assets are required to support the installations mission and the construction of these assets are funded by the US government as separate modifications or amendments to the contract The capital program historically has not used the Companys equity or debt borrowings rather the Company has used limited working capital for shortterm needs under these contracts In April 2018 the US Army instituted a requirement that a bidder must offer financing in its proposal for these new capital projects However the US Armys implementation of this requirement has limited the need for financing of these projects and the Company has been awarded several projects without any requirement to provide financing The contract price for nine of the Companys contracts with the US government is subject to redetermination two years after commencement of operations and every three years thereafter Price redetermination is a contract mechanism to periodically adjust the service fee in the next period to reflect changes in contract obligations and anticipated market conditions The remaining seven contracts with the US government are subject to annual price adjustments under a mechanism similar to price redetermination called Economic Price Adjustment All of these contracts could be terminated in whole or in part prior to the end of the 50year term for convenience of the US government or as a result of default or nonperformance by the subsidiary performing the contract In either event pursuant to termination provisions applicable to all of these contracts the Company would be entitled to recover allowable costs that it may have incurred under the contract plus the contract profit margin on incurred costs The Companys backlog of revenue associated with its contracts with the US government is approximately 54 billion  with an average remaining contract term of 42 years Competition The Companys MarketBased Businesses face competition from a number of service providers including HomeServe USA and Cinch Home Services in HOS  and American States Water Company Suez North America and Veolia Environnement SA in MSG  Environmental Health and Safety Water Quality and Other Regulation The Companys water and wastewater operations including the services provided by both its Regulated Businesses and MarketBased Businesses  are subject to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment health and safety the provision of water and wastewater services particularly with respect to the quality of water the Company delivers to its customers and the manner in which it collects treats discharges recycles and disposes of wastewater In the United States these regulations are developed under legislation including the Safe Drinking Water Act the Reduction of Lead in Drinking Water Act and the Clean Water Act Environmental health and safety and water quality regulations are complex and may vary from state to state in those instances where a state has adopted a standard that is more stringent than the Federal standard For example while the EPA has issued a nonenforceable Health Advisory for the combined level of two perfluorinated compounds perfluorooctanoic acid or PFOA and perfluorooctane sulfonate or PFOS the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection is developing drinking water standards for these two compounds and has adopted a standard for a third compound perfluorononanoic acid or PFNA as well as other perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances or PFAS The Company is also subject to various federal state local laws and regulations governing the storage of hazardous materials the management and disposal of hazardous and solid wastes discharges to air and water the cleanup of contaminated sites dam safety and other matters relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety PUCs also set conditions and standards for the water and wastewater services the Company delivers 12 Table of Contents The Company maintains an environmental program that includes responsible business practices compliance with environmental laws and regulations and effective use of natural resources which is important given the overall trend that drinking water standards have become increasingly more stringent over time As newer or stricter standards are introduced the Companys capital and operating costs could increase The Company incurs substantial costs associated with compliance with the environmental health and safety and water quality standards to which its operations are subject and the Company invests in technology solutions for enhanced detection and monitoring The Company estimates that it will make capital expenditures of approximately 600 million over the next five years for environmental control facilities which the Company defines for this purpose as any project or portion thereof that involves the preservation of air water or land The Company believes that its operations are materially in compliance with and in many cases surpass minimum standards required by applicable environmental laws and regulations The Companys operations also involve the use storage and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes For example the Companys water and wastewater treatment facilities store and use chlorine and other chemicals that generate wastes that require proper handling and disposal under applicable environmental requirements The Company also could incur remedial costs in connection with any contamination relating to its operations or facilities or its offsite disposal of wastes The Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 CERCLA authorizes the EPA and comparable state laws authorize state environmental authorities to issue orders and bring enforcement actions to compel responsible parties to investigate and take remedial actions at any site that is determined to present an actual or potential threat to human health or the environment because of an actual or threatened release of one or more hazardous substances Parties that generated or transported hazardous substances to such sites as well as current and former owners and operators of such sites may be deemed liable without regard to fault under CERCLA or comparable state laws Although the Company is not aware of any material cleanup or decontamination obligations the discovery of contamination or the imposition of such obligations in the future could result in additional costs The Companys facilities and operations are also subject to requirements under the US Occupational Safety and Health Act and inspections thereunder Certain of the Companys subsidiaries are involved in pending legal proceedings relating to environmental matters See Item 3Legal Proceedings for additional information Safe Drinking Water Act The Safe Drinking Water Act and related regulations establish national quality standards for drinking water The EPA has issued rules governing the levels of numerous naturally occurring and manmade chemical and microbial contaminants and radionuclides allowable in drinking water and continues to propose new rules These rules also prescribe testing requirements for detecting regulated contaminants the treatment systems that may be used for removing those contaminants and other requirements To date the EPA has set standards for approximately 90 contaminants and indicators for drinking water and there is a process in place to make a regulatory determination on at least five additional compounds every five years To help formulate the basis for future regulations the EPA has the authority to require monitoring for additional unregulated contaminants under the Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule the Monitoring Rule The Companys facilities have participated in the data gathering effort for the Monitoring Rule in previous rounds which occurs every five years and are also a participant in the ongoing fourth round which is scheduled for completion by the end of 2020 There are millions of other chemical compounds that are not regulated many of which are lacking a testing methodology occurrence data health effects information andor treatment technology The process of developing new drinking water standards is long and complex but the Company actively participates with the EPA and other water industry groups by sharing research and water quality operational knowledge See Research and DevelopmentEmerging Containments for additional information To effect the removal or inactivation of microbial organisms the EPA has established various rules to improve the disinfection and filtration of drinking water and to reduce consumers exposure to disinfectants and byproducts of the disinfection process In 2006 the EPA issued the LongTerm 2 Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule and the Stage 2 Disinfectants and Disinfection Byproduct Rule and finalized the Ground Water Rule which is applicable to systems providing water from underground sources In 2016 the revised Total Coliform Rule implemented a find and fix process where exceeding bacterial trigger levels requires an assessment to correct any sanitary defects The Company is within the EPAs time frame for compliance with these standards which includes sample collection data analysis engineering planning and system implementation Recent monitoring under the LongTerm 2 Rule has resulted in the need for more than 30 of the Companys surface water systems to provide additional protection against cryptosporidium In many cases this will involve installing UV disinfection and although several plants have already completed assessments and upgrades an estimated 150 million to 250 million of investment will still be required for the remaining facilities Further the EPA is actively considering regulations for a number of contaminants including strontium hexavalent chromium fluoride nitrosamines perchlorate some pharmaceuticals and certain volatile organic compounds The Company does not anticipate that any such regulations if enacted will require implementation in 2020 13 Table of Contents The Company conducts over one million water quality tests each year at its laboratory facilities and plant operations including continuous online instrumentations such as monitoring turbidity levels disinfectant residuals and adjustments to chemical treatment based on changes in incoming water The Company participates in the Partnership for Safe Water the EPAs voluntary program to meet more stringent goals for reducing microbial contaminants With 69 of the Companys 80 surface water treatment plants receiving the EPA programs prestigious Director award which recognizes utilities that i have completed a comprehensive selfassessment report ii created an action plan for continuous improvement and iii produced highquality drinking water the Company accounts for approximately onethird of the plants receiving such awards nationwide In addition 67 of the Companys surface water treatment plants have received the FiveYear Phase III award 62 plants have received the TenYear Phase III award 58 plants have received the FifteenYear Phase III award and three plants have received the TwentyYear Phase III award these awards recognize plants that have met the Director award status for five 10 15 and 20 years respectively Further nine of the Companys surface water plants have received the Presidents award which recognizes treatment plants that achieve the Partnerships rigorous individual filter effluent turbidity standards Although it is difficult to project the ultimate costs of complying with the above or other pending or future requirements the Company expects current requirements under the Safe Drinking Water Act and other similar laws to be recoverable through the regulatory process and therefore compliance costs are not expected to have a material impact on its operations or financial condition In addition capital expenditures and operating costs to comply with environmental mandates have been traditionally recognized by PUCs as appropriate for inclusion in establishing rates As a result the Company expects to recover the operating and capital costs resulting from these pending or future requirements Lead and Copper Rule and Reduction of Lead in Drinking Water Act In 1991 the EPA published the Lead and Copper Rule LCR to control lead and copper in drinking water and since that time has issued minor revisions in 2000 2004 and 2007 enhancing monitoring reporting and public education requirements In 2011 Congress enacted the Reduction of Lead in Drinking Water Act regarding the use and introduction into commerce of lead pipes plumbing fittings for fixtures solder and flux While these advances have made an impact in reducing lead exposure in drinking water legacy lead plumbing materials primarily in building plumbing still remain in many communities The failure of certain water systems in the United States to comply with the requirements of the LCR has received recent media attention and scrutiny and in certain cases has led to a number of investigations and the imposition of significant penalties and sanctions against the operators of those systems and others As part of its ongoing water main replacement and service line renewal projects the Company has started to replace LSLs in accordance with current scientific guidance Also the Company utilizes appropriate corrosion control techniques as necessary to comply with current water quality regulatory requirements The EPA proposed revisions to the LCR in November 2019 designed to provide more effective protection of public health by reducing exposure to lead and copper in drinking water The Company continues to review the implications of the LCR and comments on the proposed revisions to the rule were due to the EPA by February 12 2020 The Company will develop an implementation strategy to comply with the new requirements if and when adopted prior to the compliance effective dates in the final rule Capital expenditures and operating costs associated with compliance with any of these rule revisions cannot be determined until the final rule is promulgated but costs associated with compliance with federal regulations have been traditionally recognized by PUCs as appropriate for inclusion in establishing rates The Company currently estimates that approximately 5 of the service lines within its regulated service territories contain lead on either the Company or customer portion of the service line LSLs The Company is replacing LSLs as part of ongoing water main replacement and service line renewal projects The Companys goal is to work with the communities it currently serves to replace a significant majority of presently known LSLs in most service areas by the end of 2030 at an estimated cost ranging from 600 million to 12 billion  The Company believes this will be attainable for most service areas where public policy is supportive of this goal With regard to future acquisitions the Company will work with those communities as part of the acquisition process to set LSL removal goals appropriate for those systems The prioritization of LSL removal plan is dependent on several factors including the Companys planned water main and service line renewal projects adjacent projects by municipalities or other utilities LCR compliance monitoring results and cooperation with its customers with respect to replacing the customerowned portion of the LSL as necessary In certain cases these factors may result in a shorter or longer time frame for replacement Because replacing the external LSL in its entirety is advised by several water industry organizations including the US National Drinking Water Advisory Council the Lead Service Line Replacement Collaborative and the American Water Works Association the Companys preferred approach is to replace the entire external LSL if lead is found on either the Company or customer portion of the service line The Lead Service Line Replacement Collaborative is a diverse group of public health water utility environmental labor consumer and housing organizations from across the country working together to encourage communities to accelerate the full replacement of LSLs through collaborative efforts at the local level 14 Table of Contents Clean Water Act The Clean Water Act regulates discharges from drinking water and wastewater treatment facilities into lakes rivers streams and groundwater In addition to requirements applicable to the Companys wastewater collection systems its operations require discharge permits under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System NPDES permit program established under the Clean Water Act which must be renewed every five years Pursuant to the NPDES permit program the EPA and implementing states set maximum discharge limits for wastewater effluents and overflows from wastewater collection systems Discharges that exceed the limits specified under NPDES permits can lead to the imposition of fines and penalties and persistent noncompliance could lead to significant fines and penalties and other compliance costs In addition the difficulty of obtaining and complying with NPDES permits and renewing expiring permits may impose time and cost burdens on the Companys operations From time to time discharge violations occur at the Companys facilities some of which result in fines The Company does not expect any such violations or fines to have a material impact on its results of operations or financial condition Environmental Social Responsibility and Governance The Company

also frequently engages with the Centers for Disease Control other state environmental agencies and national and international water research foundations The Company believes that continued RD activities are critical for providing safe reliable and affordable services as well as maintaining its leadership position in the industry which provides the Company with a competitive advantage as it seeks additional business with new and existing customers Emerging Contaminants Emerging contaminants include numerous chemicals such as pharmaceuticals personal care products pesticides herbicides and endocrine disrupting compounds as well as some naturally occurring microbes such as bacteria viruses and parasites which have been detected in drinking water supplies for which the risk to the publics health is not fully understood andor has not been quantified While these contaminants have been present in drinking water for as long as they have been in use technological advances have only recently made it possible to detect many of them The ability to detect contaminants even at trace levels has raised questions among regulators and government agencies further affecting the publics perception of drinking water quality The Chemicals Abstract Service Registry contains over 159 million registered chemicals with an estimated 1400 species of diseasecausing microbes that can affect humans The Company is continually investigating new substances and contaminants employing a team of scientists engineers and public health professionals to identify threats to its water supply to act on emerging regulations and new health advisories and to evaluate the benefits of alternative or advanced treatment technologies The Company maintains stateoftheart water quality testing equipment and implements new and emerging technologies to help predict and manage potential water supply contamination issues Examples of the Companys efforts include  using its research findings to communicate information to its customers on the actions they can take to manage Legionella the Centers for Disease Control statistics indicate that waterassociated disease from Legionella is on the rise with exposure typically associated with customerowned plumbing systems in large buildings  aerial drone testing to detect harmful algal blooms and testing ultrasonic technology to help prevent taste and odor events and to eliminate cyanotoxins before they get to the water treatment plant  the implementation of water source assessment tools including sensors and analytics to evaluate and track chemical storage and aid in the detection of source water contamination events  development of methodology and measurement techniques for emerging contaminants to investigate transport occurrence and treatment and  the implementation of activated carbon biofiltration and ion exchange for the control of emerging contaminants 17 Table of Contents Service Company and Security American Water Works

many of which are beyond our control In addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Form 10K the following factors should be considered in evaluating our business and future prospects Any of the following risks either alone or taken together could materially and adversely affect our business financial position results of operations cash flows and liquidity Risks Related to Our Industry and Business Operations Our utility operations are subject to extensive regulation by state PUCs and other regulatory agencies which significantly affects our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows Our utility operations also may be subject to fines penalties and other sanctions for the inability to meet these regulatory requirements Our Regulated Businesses provide water and wastewater services to our customers through subsidiaries that are subject to regulation by state PUCs This regulation affects the rates we charge our customers and has a significant impact on our business and results of operations Generally the state PUCs authorize us to charge rates that they determine are sufficient to recover our prudently incurred operating expenses including but not limited to operating and maintenance costs depreciation financing costs and taxes and provide us the opportunity to earn an appropriate rate of return on invested capital Our ability to successfully implement our business plan and strategy depends on the rates authorized by the various state PUCs We periodically file rate increase applications with state PUCs The ensuing administrative process may be lengthy and costly Our rate increase requests may or may not be approved or may be partially approved and any approval may not occur in a timely manner Moreover a PUC may not approve a rate request to an extent that is sufficient to  cover our expenses including purchased water and costs of chemicals fuel and other commodities used in our operations  enable us to recover our investment and  provide us with an opportunity to earn an appropriate rate of return on our investment Approval of the PUCs is also required in connection with other aspects of our utilities operations Some state PUCs are empowered to impose financial penalties fines and other sanctions for noncompliance with applicable rules and regulations Our utilities are also required to have numerous permits approvals and certificates from the PUCs that regulate their businesses and authorize acquisitions dispositions and in certain cases affiliated transactions Although we believe that each utility subsidiary has obtained or sought renewal of the material permits approvals and certificates necessary for its existing operations we are unable to predict the impact that future regulatory activities may have on our business In any of these cases our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity may be adversely affected Even if rates are sufficient we face the risk that we will not achieve the rates of return on our invested capital to the extent permitted by state PUCs This could occur if certain conditions exist including but not limited to if water usage is less than the level anticipated in establishing rates or if our investments or expenses prove to be higher than the level estimated in establishing rates 20 Table of Contents Our operations and the quality of water we supply are subject to extensive and increasingly stringent environmental water quality and health and safety laws and regulations including with respect to emerging contaminants compliance with which could impact both our operating costs and capital expenditures and violations of which could subject us to substantial liabilities and costs as well as damage to our reputation Our regulated water and wastewater operations and the operations of our MarketBased Businesses are subject to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations These requirements include among others the Clean Water Act the Safe Drinking Water Act the LCR and CERCLA EPA requirements and similar federal and state laws and regulations For example state PUCs and environmental regulators set conditions and standards for the water and wastewater services we deliver If we deliver water or wastewater services to our customers that do not comply with regulatory standards or otherwise violate environmental laws regulations or permits or other health and safety and water quality regulations we could incur substantial fines penalties or other sanctions or costs as well as damage to our reputation In the most serious cases regulators could reduce requested rate increases or force us to discontinue operations and sell our operating assets to another utility or to a municipality Given the nature of our business which in part involves supplying water for human consumption any potential noncompliance with or violation of environmental water quality and health and safety laws or regulations would likely pose a more significant risk to us than to a company not similarly involved in the water and wastewater industry In addition CERCLA authorizes the EPA to issue orders and bring enforcement actions to compel responsible parties to investigate and take remedial actions with respect to actual or threatened releases of hazardous substances and can impose joint and several liability without regard to fault on responsible parties for the costs thereof We are also required to obtain various environmental permits from regulatory agencies for our operations We incur substantial operating and capital costs on an ongoing basis to comply with environmental water quality and health and safety laws and regulations These laws and regulations and their enforcement generally have become more stringent over time and new or stricter requirements could increase our costs Although we may seek to recover ongoing compliance costs in our Regulated Businesses through customer rates there can be no guarantee that the various state PUCs or similar regulatory bodies that govern our Regulated Businesses would approve rate increases that would enable us to recover such costs or that such costs will not materially and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity We may also incur liabilities if under environmental laws and regulations we are required to investigate and clean up environmental contamination including potential releases of hazardous chemicals such as chlorine which we use to treat water or at offsite locations where we have disposed of waste or caused an adverse environmental impact The discovery of previously unknown conditions or the imposition of cleanup obligations in the future could result in significant costs and could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity Such remediation costs may not be covered by insurance and may make it difficult for us to secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future Attention is being given to emerging contaminants including without limitation chemicals and other substances that currently do not have any regulatory standard in drinking water or have been recently created or discovered including by means of scientific achievements in the analysis and detection of trace amounts of substances Examples of sources of emerging contaminants include but are not limited to newly created chemical compounds including for example manufactured nanomaterials human and veterinary products perfluorinated and polyfluorinated compounds bacteria microbes viruses amoebae and other pathogens and residual byproducts of disinfection We rely upon governmental agencies to set appropriate regulatory standards to protect the public from these and other contaminants and our role is to provide service that meets these standards if any In some of our states PUCs may disapprove of cost recovery in whole or in part for implementation of treatment infrastructure for an emerging contaminant in the absence of a regulatory standard Furthermore given the rapid pace at which emerging contaminants are being created andor discovered we may not be able to detect andor mitigate all such substances in our drinking water system or supplies which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and reputation In addition we believe emerging contaminants may form the basis for additional or increased federal or state regulatory initiatives and requirements in the future which could significantly increase the cost of our operations 21 Table of Contents Limitations on availability of water supplies or restrictions on our use of water supplies as a result of government regulation or action may adversely affect our access to sources of water our ability to supply water to customers or the demand for our water services Our ability to meet the existing and future demand of our customers depends on the availability of an adequate supply of water As a general rule sources of public water supply including rivers lakes streams and groundwater aquifers are held in the public trust and are not owned by private interests As a result we typically do not own the water that we use in our operations and the availability of our water supply is established through allocation rights determined by legislation or court decisions and passingflow requirements set by governmental entities Passingflow requirements set minimum volumes of water that must pass through specified water sources such as rivers and streams in order to maintain environmental habitats and meet water allocation rights of downstream users Allocation rights are imposed to ensure sustainability of major water sources and passingflow requirements are most often imposed on source waters from smaller rivers lakes and streams These requirements which can change from time to time and vary by state or region may adversely impact our water supply Supply issues such as drought overuse of sources of water the protection of threatened species or habitats contamination or other factors may limit the availability of ground and surface water For example in our Monterey County California operations we are seeking to augment our sources of water supply principally to comply with an October 20 2009 cease and desist order the 2009 Order as amended by an order in July 2016 the 2016 Order of the SWRCB that requires CaliforniaAmerican Water Company our wholly owned subsidiary Cal Am to significantly decrease its diversions from the Carmel River in accordance with a reduction schedule that terminates on December 31 2021 the 2021 Deadline We are also required to augment our Monterey County sources of water supply to comply with the requirements of the Endangered Species Act We cannot predict whether Cal Am will be able to secure alternative sources of water or if Cal Am will be exposed to liabilities including fines and penalties if it is unable to meet the 2021 Deadline under the 2016 Order Furthermore Cal Am continues to work constructively with all appropriate agencies to provide necessary information to obtain the required approvals for the Water Supply Project however due to the delay in the approval schedule Cal Am currently does not believe that it will be able to fully comply with the diversion reduction requirements and other remaining requirements under the 2009 Order and the 2016 Order including the 2021 Deadline If Cal Am or any of our other subsidiaries are unable to secure an alternative source of water or if other adverse consequences result from the events described above our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected See Item 3Legal Proceedings Alternative Water Supply in Lieu of Carmel River Diversions which includes additional information regarding this matter Climate variability may cause increased volatility in weather and may impact water usage and related revenue or require additional expenditures all of which may not be fully recoverable in rates or otherwise The issue of climate variability is receiving increasing attention nationally and worldwide Some scientific experts are predicting a worsening of weather volatility in the future associated with climate variability Many climate variability predictions if true present several potential challenges to water and wastewater utilities including us such as  increased frequency and duration of droughts  increased precipitation and flooding  increased frequency and severity of storms and other weather events  challenges associated with changes in temperature or increases in ocean levels  potential degradation of water quality  decreases in available water supply and changes in water usage patterns  increases in disruptions in service  increased costs to repair damaged facilities or  increased costs to reduce risks associated with the increasing frequency of natural events including to improve the resiliency and reliability of our water production and delivery facilities and systems Because of the uncertainty of weather volatility related to climate variability we cannot predict its potential impact on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity Although some or all potential expenditures and costs with respect to our Regulated Businesses could be recovered through rates infrastructure replacement surcharges or other regulatory mechanisms there can be no assurance that state PUCs would authorize rate increases to enable us to recover such expenditures and costs in whole or in part 22 Table of Contents The current regulatory rate setting process may result in a significant delay also known as regulatory lag from the time that we invest in infrastructure improvements incur increased operating expenses or experience declining water usage to the time at which we can seek to address these events in rate case applications our inability to minimize regulatory lag could adversely affect our business There is typically a delay known as regulatory lag between the time one of our regulated subsidiaries makes a capital investment or incurs an operating expense increase and the time when those costs are reflected in rates In addition billings permitted by state PUCs typically are to a considerable extent based on the volume of water usage in addition to a minimum base rate Thus we may experience regulatory lag between the time our revenues are affected by declining usage and the time we are able to adjust the rate per gallon of usage to address declining usage Our inability to reduce regulatory lag could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity We endeavor to reduce regulatory lag by pursuing constructive regulatory policies For example three of our states have approved revenue stability mechanisms that adjust rates periodically to ensure that a utilitys revenue will be sufficient to cover its costs regardless of sales volume including recognition of declining sales resulting from reduced consumption while providing an incentive for customers to use water more efficiently In addition 11 of our state PUCs permit rates to be adjusted outside of the general rate case application process through surcharges that address certain capital investments such as replacement of aging infrastructure These surcharges are adjusted periodically based on factors such as project completion or future budgeted expenditures and specific surcharges are eliminated once the related capital investment is incorporated in new PUC approved rates Furthermore in setting rates ten of our state PUCs allow us to use future test years which extend beyond the date a rate request is filed to allow for current or projected revenues expenses and investments to be reflected in rates on a more timely basis Other examples of such programs include states that allow us to increase rates for certain cost increases that are beyond our control such as purchased water costs property or other taxes or power conservation chemical or other expenditures These surcharge mechanisms enable us to adjust rates in less time after costs have been incurred than would be the case under the general rate case application process While these programs have reduced regulatory lag in several of our regulated states we continue to seek expansion of programs to reduce regulatory lag in those jurisdictions that have not approved such programs Furthermore PUCs may fail to adopt new surcharge programs and existing programs may not continue in their current form or at all Although we intend to continue our efforts to expand state PUC approval of surcharges to address issues of regulatory lag our efforts may not be successful or even if successful they may not completely address our regulatory lag in which case our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity may be materially and adversely affected Changes in laws and regulations and changes in certain agreements can significantly affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity New legislation regulations government policies or court decisions including without limitation with respect to federal and state income and other tax laws can materially affect our operations results of operations and cash flows The individuals who serve as regulators are elected or political appointees Therefore elections which result in a change of political administration or new appointments may also result in changes in the individuals who serve as regulators and the policies of the regulatory agencies that they serve New laws or regulations new interpretations of existing laws or regulations changes in agency policy including those made in response to shifts in public opinion or conditions imposed during the regulatory hearing process could have the following consequences among others  making it more difficult for us to increase our rates and as a consequence to recover our costs or earn our expected rates of return  changing the determination of the costs or the amount of costs that would be considered recoverable in rate cases  restricting our ability to terminate our services to customers who owe us money for services previously provided or limiting our bill collection efforts  requiring us to provide water or wastewater services at reduced rates to certain customers  limiting or restricting our ability to acquire water or wastewater systems purchase or dispose of assets or issue securities or making it less costeffective for us to do so  negatively impacting the deductibility of expenses under federal or state tax laws the amount of tax credits or tax abatement benefits that may be available the amount of taxes owed the timing of tax effects on rates or the ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards  changing regulations that affect the benefits we expected to receive when we began offering services in a particular area  increasing the associated costs of or difficulty complying with environmental health safety consumer privacy water quality and water quality accountability laws and regulations to which our operations are subject 23 Table of Contents  changing or placing additional limitations on change in control requirements relating to any concentration of ownership of our common stock  making it easier for governmental entities to convert our assets to public ownership via condemnation eminent domain or other similar process or for governmental agencies or private plaintiffs to assess liability against us for damages under these or similar processes  placing limitations prohibitions or other requirements with respect to the sharing of information and participation in transactions by or between a regulated subsidiary and us or our other affiliates including Service Company and any of our other subsidiaries  restricting or prohibiting our extraction of water from rivers streams reservoirs or aquifers and  revoking or altering the terms of a CPCN issued to us by a state PUC Any of the foregoing consequences could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity In addition new Federal state and local laws changes in existing laws rules or regulations or administrative interpretations thereof could impact us In December 2017 the TCJA was signed into law which among other things enacted significant and complex changes to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as amended the Code including a reduction in the maximum US federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 as of January 1 2018 and certain other provisions related specifically to the public utility industry including the normalization of our deferred income taxes The enactment of the TCJA required remeasurement of our deferred income taxes which materially impacted our 2017 results of operations and financial position and had a lesser impact on our 2018 results of operations and financial position Following enactment of the TCJA the Company adjusted its customer rates and deferred income taxes to reflect the lower income tax rate as mandated by PUCs in jurisdictions that have addressed the issue We expect that further impacts to our deferred income taxes will continue to occur through pending or future rate cases or other proceedings in the remaining jurisdictions At this time we cannot predict the impacts on us of the regulatory treatment of the TCJA in these remaining proceedings or of the enactment or adoption of any Related Interpretations if and when issued Moreover we are unable to determine or predict the potential impacts if any of any other new or amended laws rules or regulations or interpretations thereof including without limitation further amendments to the Code or applicable Treasury regulations to the extent they may be ultimately enacted adopted or issued on us or our businesses financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity Service disruptions caused by severe weather conditions climate variability patterns or natural disasters may disrupt our operations or reduce the demand for our water services which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity Service interruptions due to severe weather climate variability patterns and other natural events are possible across all our businesses These include among other things storms freezing conditions high wind conditions hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes landslides drought wildfires coastal and intercoastal floods or high water conditions including those in or near designated flood plains severe electrical storms sinkholes and solar flares Weather and other natural events such as these may affect the condition or operability of our facilities limiting or preventing us from delivering water or wastewater services to our customers or requiring us to make substantial capital expenditures to repair any damage Tariffs in place or cost recovery proceedings with respect to our Regulated Businesses may not provide reimbursement to us in whole or in part for any of these impacts Government restrictions on water use may also result in decreased use of water services even if our water supplies are sufficient to serve our customers which may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows Seasonal drought conditions that may impact our water services are possible across all of our service areas Governmental restrictions imposed in response to a drought may apply to all systems within a region independent of the supply adequacy of any individual system Responses may range from voluntary to mandatory water use restrictions rationing restrictions water conservation regulations and requirements to minimize water system leaks While expenses incurred in implementing water conservation and rationing plans may generally be recoverable provided the relevant PUC determines they were reasonable and prudent we cannot assure that any such expenses incurred will in fact be fully recovered Moreover reductions in water consumption including those resulting from installation of equipment or changed consumer behavior may persist even after drought restrictions are repealed and the drought has ended which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 24 Table of Contents A loss of one or more large industrial customers could have a material adverse impact upon the results of operations of one or more of our Regulated Businesses Adverse economic conditions or other factors can cause our customers particularly industrial customers to curtail operations A curtailment of operations by an industrial customer would typically result in reduced water usage by that customer In more severe circumstances the decline in usage could be permanent Any decrease in demand resulting from difficult economic conditions affecting these industrial customers could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations Tariffs in place with respect to our Regulated Businesses may not reimburse us in whole or in part for any of these impacts Our Regulated Businesses require significant capital expenditures and may suffer if we fail to secure appropriate funding to make investments or if we experience delays in completing major capital expenditure projects The water and wastewater utility business is capital intensive We invest significant amounts of capital to add replace and maintain property plant and equipment and to improve aging infrastructure In 2019  we invested 17 billion in net Companyfunded capital improvements The level of capital expenditures necessary to maintain the integrity of our systems will continue into the future and may increase We expect to fund capital improvement projects using cash generated from operations borrowings under our revolving credit facility and commercial paper programs and issuances of longterm debt and equity We may not be able to access our revolving credit facility or the commercial paper longterm debt and equity capital markets when necessary or desirable to fund capital improvements on favorable terms or at all If we are not able to obtain sufficient financing we may be unable to maintain our existing property plant and equipment fund our capital investment strategies meet our growth targets and expand our rate base to enable us to earn satisfactory future returns on our investments Even with adequate financial resources to make required capital expenditures we face the additional risk that we will not complete our major capital projects on time as a result of construction delays permitting delays labor shortages or other disruptions environmental restrictions or other obstacles Each of these outcomes could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows Aging infrastructure may lead to service disruptions property damage and increased capital expenditures and OM costs all of which could negatively impact our financial results We have risks associated with aging infrastructure including water and sewer mains pumping stations and water and wastewater treatment facilities Additionally the nature of information available on buried and newly acquired assets may be limited which may challenge our ability to conduct efficient asset management and maintenance practices Assets that have aged beyond their expected useful lives may experience a higher rate of failure Failure of aging infrastructure could result in increased capital expenditures and OM costs and negatively impact our future OM efficiency ratio In addition failure of aging infrastructure may result in property damage and in safety environmental and public health impacts To the extent that any increased costs or expenditures are not fully recovered in rates our results of operations liquidity and cash flows could be negatively impacted Seasonality could adversely affect the volume of water sold and our revenues The volume of water we sell during the warmer months typically in the summer is generally greater than during other months due primarily to increased water usage for irrigation systems swimming pools cooling systems and other applications Throughout the year and particularly during typically warmer months the volume of water sold tends to vary with temperature rainfall levels and rainfall frequency In the event that temperatures during the typically warmer months are cooler than normal or if there is more rainfall than normal the amount of water we sell may decrease and adversely affect our revenues Three of our jurisdictions California Illinois and New York have adopted revenue stability mechanisms that permit us to collect state PUCauthorized revenue for a given period which is not tied to the volume of water sold during that period Revenue stability mechanisms are designed to allow utilities to recover the fixed cost of operations while supporting water conservation goals In those jurisdictions that have not adopted a revenue stability mechanism operating results could continue to be affected by seasonality Regulatory and environmental risks associated with the collection treatment and disposal of wastewater may impose significant costs The wastewater collection treatment and disposal operations of our subsidiaries are subject to substantial regulation and involve environmental risks If collection treatment or disposal systems fail overflow or do not operate properly untreated wastewater or other contaminants could spill onto nearby properties or into nearby streams and rivers causing damage to persons or property injury to aquatic life and economic damages This risk is most acute during periods of substantial rainfall or flooding which are the main causes of sewer overflow and system failure Liabilities resulting from such damage could adversely and materially affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 25 Table of Contents Contamination of water supplies or our water service provided to our customers could result in service limitations and interruptions and exposure to substances not typically found in potable water supplies and could subject us and our subsidiaries to reductions in usage and other responsive obligations government enforcement actions damage to our reputation and private litigation The water supplies that flow into our treatment plants or are delivered through our distribution system or the water service that is provided to our customers may be subject to contamination including among other items contamination from naturallyoccurring compounds chemicals in groundwater systems pollution resulting from manmade sources such as perchlorate methyl tertiary butyl ether lead and other materials chemical spills or other accidents that result in contaminants entering the water source and possible terrorist attacks In addition new categories of these substances continue to emerge in the water industry If one of our water supplies or the water service provided to our customers is contaminated depending on the nature of the contamination we may have to take responsive actions that could include among other things 1 continuing limited use of the water supply under a Do Not Use protective order that enables continuation of basic sanitation and essential fire protection or 2 interrupting the use of that water supply If service is disrupted our financial condition results of operations cash flows liquidity and reputation may be adversely affected In addition we may incur significant costs in order to treat the contaminated source through the expansion of our current treatment facilities or the development of new sources of supply or new treatment methods We may be unable to recover costs associated with treating or decontaminating water supplies through insurance customer rates tariffs or contract terms Any recovery of these costs that we are able to obtain through regulatory proceedings or otherwise may not occur in a timely manner Moreover we could be subject to claims for damages arising from government enforcement actions or toxic tort or other lawsuits arising out of an interruption of service or human exposure to hazardous substances in our drinking water and water supplies Since we engage in the business of providing water service to our customers contamination of the water supply or the water service provided to our customers could result in substantial injury or damage to our customers employees or others and we could be exposed to substantial claims and litigation Such claims could relate to among other things personal injury loss of life business interruption property damage pollution and environmental damage and may be brought by our customers or third parties Litigation and regulatory proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings can and do occur and we may not be protected from these claims or negative impacts therefrom in whole or in part by tariffs or other contract terms Negative impacts to our reputation may occur even if we are not liable for any contamination or other environmental damage or the consequences arising out of human exposure to contamination or hazardous substances in the water or water supplies In addition insurance coverage may not cover all or a portion of these losses and are subject to deductibles and other limitations Pending or future claims against us could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows We may sustain losses that exceed or are excluded from our insurance coverage or for which we are selfinsured We maintain insurance coverage as part of our overall legal and risk management strategy to minimize potential liabilities arising from our utility operations as well as the operations of our MarketBased Businesses  Our insurance programs have varying coverage limits exclusions and maximums and insurance companies may seek to deny claims we might make Generally our insurance policies cover property damage workers compensation employers liability general liability cybersecurity terrorism risks and automobile liability Each policy includes deductibles or selfinsured retentions and policy limits for covered claims As a result we may sustain losses that exceed or that are excluded from our insurance coverage or for which we are selfinsured Although in the past we have been generally able to obtain insurance coverage related to our business there can be no assurance that we can secure all necessary or appropriate insurance in the future or that such insurance can be economically secured For example catastrophic events can result in decreased coverage limits more limited coverage increased premium costs or deductibles We are subject to adverse publicity and reputational risks which make us vulnerable to negative customer perception and could lead to increased regulatory oversight or sanctions Our business and operations have a large direct and indirect customer base and as a result we are exposed to public criticism regarding among other things the reliability of their water wastewater and related or ancillary services the quality of water provided and the amount timeliness accuracy and format of bills that are provided for such services Adverse publicity and negative consumer sentiment may render legislatures and other governing bodies state PUCs and other regulatory authorities and government officials less likely to view us in a favorable light and may cause us to be susceptible to less favorable legislative regulatory and economic outcomes as well as increased regulatory or other oversight and more stringent regulatory or economic requirements Unfavorable regulatory and economic outcomes may include the enactment of more stringent laws and regulations governing our operations and less favorable economic terms in our agreements related to our MarketBased Businesses  as well as fines penalties or other sanctions or requirements The imposition of any of the foregoing could have a material negative impact on us and our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 26 Table of Contents For example New York American Water Company Inc NYAW has been the subject of a New York State Public Service Commission NYSPSC investigation related to the unintentional provision of incorrect data to a taxing authority that resulted in an overassessment of real property taxes NYAW selfreported this issue to the NYSPSC promptly after NYAWs senior leadership became aware of it Neither NYAW nor any of its employees received any financial benefit as a result of this matter as all customer overpayments were provided to the local taxing authorities The NYSPSC investigation also related to the failure of a few employees working on NYAWs 2016 general rate case to properly disclose these issues in that rate case In September 2018 a settlement of these matters was approved by the Supreme Court of the State of New York Albany County and NYAW has been working with the New York State Department of Public Service to implement its terms While the settlement resolves the NYSPSCs investigation involving NYAW and those matters set forth above there can be no assurance that NYAW will not be subject to additional federal state or local proceedings regarding these and other related matters and these proceedings could result in increased oversight and civil administrative andor criminal sanctions which may have a material adverse effect upon our reputation and perception The failure of or the requirement to repair upgrade or dismantle any of our dams may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity The properties of our Regulated Businesses segment include 76 dams the majority of which are earthen dams and the failure of any of which could result in personal injury and property damage including without limitation downstream property damage for which we may be liable The failure of a dam would also adversely affect our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations Any losses or liabilities incurred due to a failure of one of our dams might not be covered by insurance policies or be recoverable in rates and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future We also are required from time to time to decommission repair or upgrade the dams that we own The cost of such repairs or upgrades can be and has been material The federal and state agencies that regulate our operations may adopt rules and regulations requiring us to dismantle our dams which also could entail material costs Although in most cases the PUC has permitted recovery of expenses and capital investment related to dam rehabilitation we might not be able to recover costs of repairs upgrades or dismantling through rates in the future The inability to recover these costs or delayed recovery of the costs as a result of regulatory lag can affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity Any failure of our network of water and wastewater pipes and water reservoirs could result in losses and damages that may affect our financial condition and reputation Our operating subsidiaries distribute water and collect wastewater through an extensive network of pipes and storage systems located across the United States A failure of major pipes or reservoirs could result in injuries property and other damage for which we may be liable The failure of major pipes and reservoirs may also result in the need to shut down some facilities or parts of our network in order to conduct repairs Such failures and shutdowns may limit our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and to meet the water and wastewater delivery requirements prescribed by government regulators including state PUCs with jurisdiction over our operations and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows liquidity and reputation Any business interruption or other losses might not be covered by insurance policies or be recoverable in rates and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future Moreover to the extent such business interruptions or other losses are not covered by insurance they may not be recovered through rate adjustments An important part of our growth strategy is the acquisition of water and wastewater systems which involves risks including competition for acquisition opportunities from other regulated utilities governmental entities and other buyers that may hinder or limit our ability to grow our business An important element of our growth strategy is the acquisition and optimization of water and wastewater systems in order to broaden our current and move into new service areas We may not be able to acquire other systems or businesses if we cannot identify suitable acquisition opportunities or reach mutually agreeable terms with acquisition candidates Further competition for acquisition opportunities from other regulated utilities governmental entities and other buyers may hinder our ability to expand our business The negotiation and execution of potential acquisitions as well as the integration of acquired systems or businesses with our existing operations could require us to incur significant costs and cause diversion of our managements time and resources Future acquisitions by us could result in among other things  incurrence or assumption of debt contingent liabilities and environmental liabilities of or with respect to an acquired business including liabilities that were unknown at the time of acquisition  failure to recover acquisition premiums  unanticipated capital expenditures  failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting 27 Table of Contents  the need to successfully integrate the acquired systems cybersecurity and infrastructure protection measures with those of the Companys  recording goodwill and other intangible assets at values that ultimately may be subject to impairment charges  fluctuations in quarterly results  unanticipated acquisitionrelated expenses  failure to realize anticipated benefits such as cost savings and revenue enhancements and  difficulties in integrating or assimilating personnel benefits services and systems Some or all of these items could have a material adverse effect on our business The systems and businesses we acquire in the future may not achieve anticipated sales and profitability or other perceived synergies and any difficulties we encounter in the integration process could interfere with our operations reduce our operating margins and adversely affect our internal control over financial reporting We compete with governmental entities other regulated utilities and strategic and financial buyers for acquisition opportunities If consolidation becomes more prevalent in the water and wastewater industries and competition for acquisitions increases the prices for suitable acquisition candidates may increase and limit our ability to expand through acquisitions Our Regulated Businesses are subject to condemnation and other proceedings through eminent domain or other similar authorized process which could materially and adversely affect their results of operations and financial condition Municipalities and other government subdivisions have historically been involved in the provision of water and wastewater services in the United States and organized efforts may arise from time to time in one or more of the service areas in which our Regulated Businesses operate to convert our assets to public ownership and operation through exercise of the governmental power of eminent domain or another similar authorized process A municipality or other government subdivision or a citizen group may seek to acquire our assets through eminent domain or such other process either directly or indirectly as a result of a citizen petition For example in November 2018 Monterey California ballot Measure J was certified as having been approved by a public vote requiring the MPWMD to conduct a study and submit a written plan concerning the feasibility of a potential purchase of the Monterey system assets without an additional public vote On November 6 2019 the MPWMD issued a preliminary report finding among other things that the acquisition of the Monterey system assets by the MPWMD would be economically feasible Also five municipalities in the Chicago Illinois area formed a water agency that filed an eminent domain lawsuit against our Illinois subsidiary in January 2013 seeking to condemn a water pipeline that serves those five municipalities This lawsuit remains pending and a valuation trial is likely to be held in the near future See Item 1BusinessRegulated BusinessesCondemnation and Eminent Domain  which includes additional information regarding these matters Furthermore the law in certain jurisdictions in which our Regulated Businesses operate provides for eminent domain rights allowing private property owners to file a lawsuit to seek just compensation against a public utility if the public utilitys infrastructure has been determined to be a substantial cause of damage to that property In these actions the plaintiff would not have to prove that the public utility acted negligently In California lawsuits have been filed in connection with largescale natural events such as wildfires Some have included allegations that infrastructure of certain utilities triggered the natural event that resulted in damage to the property In some cases the PUC has disallowed recovery in rates of losses incurred by these utilities as a result of such lawsuits Contesting an exercise of condemnation eminent domain or other similar process or responding to a citizen petition may result in costly legal proceedings and may divert the attention of management Moreover our efforts to resist the condemnation eminent domain or other process may not be successful which may require us to sell the operations at issue in a condemnation proceeding or to pay a private property owner compensation for the property damage suffered If a municipality or other government subdivision succeeds in acquiring the assets of one or more of our Regulated Businesses through eminent domain or other process there is a risk that we will not receive adequate compensation for the business that we will not be able to keep the compensation or that we will not be able to divest the business without incurring significant charges Any of these outcomes may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition cash flows and liquidity We rely on operational and technology systems to facilitate the management of our business and customer and supplier relationships and a disruption of these systems could adversely affect our business Our operational and technology systems are an integral part of our business and any disruption of these systems could significantly limit our ability to manage and operate our business efficiently which in turn could cause our business and competitive position to suffer and adversely affect our results of operations For example we depend on these systems to bill customers process orders provide customer service manage certain plant operations and construction projects manage our financial records track assets remotely monitor certain of our plants and facilities and manage human resources supply chain inventory and accounts receivable collections 28 Table of Contents Although we do not believe that these systems are at a materially greater risk of failure than other similar organizations our technology systems remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from  power loss computer systems failures and internet telecommunications or data network failures  operator error or improper operation by the negligent or improper supervision of or the intentional acts of employees and contractors  physical and electronic loss of customer or employee data due to security breaches cyber attacks hacking denial of services action misappropriation of data or other property and similar events  computer viruses and  severe weather and other events including without limitation hurricanes tornadoes fires floods earthquakes and other disasters These events may result in physical and electronic loss of customer employee or financial data security breaches misappropriation of property and other adverse consequences In addition a lack of or inadequate levels of redundancy for certain of these systems including billing systems could exacerbate the impact of any of these events on us We may not be successful in developing or acquiring technology that is competitive and responsive to the needs of our business and we might lack sufficient resources to make the necessary upgrades or replacements of outdated existing technology to enable us to continue to operate at our current level of efficiency Any or all of these events could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows We may be subject to physical andor cyber attacks As operators of critical infrastructure we may face a heightened risk of physical andor cyber attacks from internal or external sources Our water and wastewater systems may be vulnerable to disability or failures as a result of physical or cyber attacks acts of war or terrorism vandalism or other causes Our operational and technology systems throughout our businesses may be vulnerable to unauthorized external or internal access due to hacking viruses acts of war or terrorism and other causes Unauthorized access to confidential information located or stored on these systems could negatively and materially impact our customers employees suppliers and other third parties Further third parties including vendors suppliers and contractors who perform certain services for us or administer and maintain our sensitive information could also be targets of cyber attacks and unauthorized access While we have instituted safeguards to protect our operational and technology systems those safeguards may not always be effective due to the evolving nature of cyber attacks and cyber vulnerabilities We cannot guarantee that such protections will be completely successful in the event of a cyber attack If despite our security measures a significant physical attack or cyber breach occurred our operations could be disrupted property damaged and customer and other confidential information lost or stolen experience substantial loss of revenues response costs and other financial loss suffer a loss of management time attention and resources from our regular business operations and be subject to increased regulation litigation and damage to our reputation any of which could have a negative impact on our business results of operations and cash flows Experiencing a cyber security incident could also cause us to be noncompliant with applicable laws and regulations or contracts that require us to securely maintain confidential data causing us to incur costs related to legal claims or proceedings and regulatory fines or penalties These types of events either impacting our facilities or the industry in general could also cause us to incur additional security and insurance related costs In addition in the ordinary course of business we collect and retain sensitive information including personally identifiable information about our customers and employees In many cases we outsource administration of certain functions to vendors that could be targets of cyber attacks Any theft loss andor fraudulent use of customer employee or proprietary data as a result of a cyber attack could subject us to significant litigation liability and costs as well as adversely impact our reputation with customers and regulators among others We have obtained cyber insurance to provide coverage for a portion of the losses and damages that may result from a security breach but such insurance is subject to a number of exclusions and may not cover the total loss or damage caused by a breach The market for cybersecurity insurance is relatively new and coverage available for cybersecurity events may evolve as the industry matures In the future adequate insurance may not be available at rates that we believe are reasonable and the costs of responding to and recovering from a cyber incident may not be covered by insurance or recoverable in rates 29 Table of Contents Our inability to efficiently upgrade and improve our operational and technology systems or implement new systems could result in higher than expected costs or otherwise adversely impact our internal controls environment operations and profitability Upgrades and improvements to computer systems and networks or the implementation of new systems may require substantial amounts of managements time and financial resources to complete and may also result in system or network defects or operational errors due to multiple factors including employees ability to effectively use the new or upgraded system We continue to implement technology to improve our business processes and customer interactions and have installed new and upgraded existing technology systems These efforts support our broader strategic initiatives and are intended to improve our operations and enhance our customer service capabilities Any technical or other difficulties in upgrading and improving existing or implementing new technology systems may increase costs beyond those anticipated and have an adverse or disruptive effect on our operations and reporting processes including our internal control over financial reporting We may also experience difficulties integrating current systems with new or upgraded systems which may impact our ability to serve our customers effectively or efficiently Although we make efforts to minimize any adverse impact on our controls business and operations we cannot assure that all such impacts have been or will be mitigated and any such impacts could harm our business individually or collectively and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows An inability to successfully develop and implement new technologies poses substantial risks to our business and operational excellence strategies which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results A significant part of our longterm strategic focus on safety operational excellence OM expense efficiency water quality asset and capital management and the customer experience includes the development and implementation of new technologies to be used for among other things customer service and support environmental compliance water metering water quality and source monitoring cybersecurity business development and growth data analysis employee development and training and other initiatives For example we have made and plan to continue to make significant investments in developing deploying and maintaining customerfacing technologies applications to support field service and customer service operations water source sensor and evaluation technologies and data analysis and artificial intelligence technologies Where appropriate we also seek to align these new technologies with existing technology infrastructure and systems There can be no assurance that we will be successful in designing developing deploying integrating or maintaining these new technologies and if they do not perform effectively or adequately serve their respective business objectives their value to us and our business and operations may be negatively and materially impacted Because these efforts can be longterm in nature these new technologies may be more costly or timeconsuming than expected to design develop integrate and complete and may not ultimately deliver the expected or desired benefits upon completion Technologies that do not perform as intended or desired may need to be redesigned redeveloped or abandoned While we have and will continue to seek to recover costs and earn a return on capital expenditures with respect to the costs and expenses of development and deployment of these new technologies in our Regulated Businesses there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in every instance or at all Our failure to timely and effectively invest in develop deploy and implement improvements to and properly maintain the operation and integrity of our new technologies including related data and other related systems andor adequately obtain recovery in rates of the costs and expenses associated with such activities may adversely affect our ability to achieve intended OM expense efficiencies or other key performance results and ultimately could materially and adversely impact our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows All of the intellectual property that has been or is being used or developed in connection with these technologies we believe we own or have valid licenses to use However competitors contracting parties or other third parties may bring claims against us to challenge our right to use license sublicense market or monetize in whole or in part such intellectual property or derivatives thereof or works made therefrom and the assertion defense or protection of our intellectual property rights could be expensive timeconsuming and ultimately unsuccessful If we are unable to do so or it is determined that we do not own or have valid licenses or other rights to any of the intellectual property used in our technologies we may lose valuable rights to what we regard as our intellectual property the carrying values of the affected technologies may need to be decreased significantly and we may be required to obtain or purchase licenses at significant cost from third parties to use the intellectual property In any of these cases we may be unable to execute our longterm strategy and our financial condition results of operations and cash flows may be materially and adversely impacted Our business has inherently dangerous workplaces If we fail to maintain safe work sites we may experience workforce injuries or loss of life and be exposed to financial losses including penalties and other liabilities Safety is a core value and a strategy at American Water Our safety performance and continual progress to our ultimate desired goal of zero injuries is critical to our reputation We maintain health and safety standards to protect our employees customers contractors vendors and the public Although we intend to adhere to such health and safety standards with a goal of achieving zero injuries it is extremely challenging to eliminate all safety incidents at all times 30 Table of Contents At our business sites including construction and maintenance sites our employees contractors and others are often in close proximity to large pieces of equipment moving vehicles pressurized water underground trenches and vaults chemicals and other regulated materials On many sites we are responsible for safety and accordingly must implement important safety procedures and practices above what governmental regulations require If we fail to implement such procedures or if the procedures we implement are ineffective or are not followed by our employees or others our employees contractors and others may experience minor serious or fatal injuries Unsafe work sites have the potential to increase employee turnover expose us to litigation and raise our operating costs Any of the foregoing could result in financial losses which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows In addition our operations can involve the delivery handling and storage of hazardous chemicals which if improperly delivered handled stored or disposed of could result in serious injury death environmental damage or property damage and could subject us to penalties or other liabilities We are also subject to regulations dealing with occupational health and safety Although we maintain functional employee groups whose primary purpose is to ensure we implement effective health and safety work procedures and practices throughout our organization including construction sites and maintenance sites the failure to comply with such regulations or procedures could subject us to liability Work stoppages and other labor relations matters could adversely affect our results of operations As of December 31 2019  approximately 46 of our workforce was represented by unions and we had 71 collective bargaining agreements in place with 14 different unions representing our unionized employees These collective bargaining agreements including four which are beyond expiration and 14 which will expire during 2020  are subject to periodic renewal and renegotiation We may not be able to successfully renew or renegotiate these labor contracts on terms that are fair to us Any negotiations or dispute resolution processes undertaken in connection with our labor contracts could be delayed or affected by labor actions or work stoppages Labor actions work stoppages or the threat of work stoppages and our failure to obtain favorable labor contract terms during renegotiations may disrupt our operations and result in higher labor costs which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity While we have developed contingency plans to be implemented as necessary if a work stoppage or strike does occur a strike or work stoppage may have a material adverse impact on our financial position results of operations and cash flows Our continued success is dependent upon our ability to hire retain and utilize qualified personnel The success of our business is dependent upon our ability to hire retain and utilize qualified personnel including engineers licensed operators water quality and other operating and craft personnel and management professionals who have the required experience and expertise From time to time it may be difficult to attract and retain qualified individuals with the expertise and in the timeframe demanded for our business needs In certain geographic areas for example we may not be able to satisfy the demand for our services because of our inability to successfully hire and retain qualified personnel In addition as key personnel approach retirement age we need to have appropriate succession plans in place and to successfully implement such plans If we cannot attract and retain qualified personnel or effectively implement appropriate succession plans our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows may be materially and adversely impacted Financial and MarketRelated Risks Our indebtedness could affect our business adversely and limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business and we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our liquidity needs As of December 31 2019  our aggregate longterm and shortterm debt balance including preferred stock with mandatory redemption requirements was 95 billion  and our working capital defined as current assets less current liabilities was in a deficit position Our indebtedness could have important consequences including  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital requirements or capital expenditures  exposing us to interest rate risk with respect to the portion of our indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates  limiting our ability to pay dividends on our common stock or make payments in connection with our other obligations  impairing our access to the capital markets for debt and equity  requiring that an increasing portion of our cash flows from operations be dedicated to the payment of the principal and interest on our debt thereby reducing funds available for future operations dividends on our common stock or capital expenditures  limiting our ability to take advantage of significant business opportunities such as acquisition opportunities and to react to changes in market or industry conditions and  placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to those of our competitors that have less debt 31 Table of Contents In order to meet our capital expenditure needs we may be required to make additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility or issue a combination of new shortterm and longterm debt securities and equity Moreover additional borrowings may be required to refinance outstanding indebtedness Debt maturities and sinking fund payments in 2020  2021 and 2022 will be 28 million  310 million and 14 million  respectively We can provide no assurance that we will be able to access the debt or equity capital markets on favorable terms if at all Moreover if new debt is added to our current debt levels the related risks we now face could intensify limiting our ability to refinance existing debt on favorable terms In an attempt to manage our exposure to interest rate risk associated with our issuance of variable and fixed rate debt we have in the past entered into and in the future may enter into financial derivative instruments including without limitation interest rate swaps forward starting swaps swaptions and US Treasury lock agreements See Item 7AQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  However these efforts may not be effective to fully mitigate interest rate risk and may expose us to other risks and uncertainties including quarterly mark to market valuation risk associated with these instruments that could negatively and materially affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows Our ability to pay our expenses and satisfy our debt service obligations depends in significant part on our future performance which will be affected by the financial business economic competitive legislative including tax initiatives and reforms and other similar legislation or regulation regulatory and other risk factors described in this section many of which are beyond our control If we do not have sufficient cash flows to pay the principal and interest on our outstanding debt we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt reduce capital investments sell assets borrow additional funds or sell additional equity In addition if our business does not generate sufficient cash flows from operations or if we are unable to incur indebtedness sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs we may be unable to plan for or respond to changes in our business which could cause our financial condition operating results and prospects to be affected materially and adversely Our inability to access the capital or financial markets or other events could affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs at reasonable cost and our ability to meet longterm commitments which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations In addition to cash from operations we rely primarily on our revolving credit facility commercial paper program and the capital markets to satisfy our liquidity needs In this regard our principal external sources of shortterm liquidity are our 210 billion commercial paper program and our 225 billion revolving credit facility Our revolving credit facility currently expires in accordance with its terms in March 2024 although under those terms we may request to extend the expiration date for up to one year We regularly use our commercial paper program under this revolving credit facility as a principal source of shortterm borrowing due to the generally more attractive rates we generally can obtain in the commercial paper market As of December 31 2019  American Water Capital Corp AWCC our wholly owned financing subsidiary had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and had 786 million of commercial paper outstanding and 76 million in outstanding letters of credit There can be no assurance that AWCC will be able to continue to access its commercial paper program or its revolving credit facility when as and if desired or that the amount of capital available thereunder will be sufficient to meet all of our liquidity needs at a reasonable or any cost Under the terms of our revolving credit facility our consolidated debt cannot exceed 70 of our consolidated capitalization as determined under the terms of the credit facility If our equity were to decline or debt were to increase to a level that caused our debt to exceed this limit lenders under the credit facility would be entitled to refuse any further extension of credit and to declare all of the outstanding debt under the credit facility immediately due and payable To avoid such a default a waiver or renegotiation of this covenant would be required which would likely increase funding costs and could result in additional covenants that would restrict our operational and financing flexibility Our ability to comply with this and other covenants contained in the revolving credit facility and our other consolidated indebtedness is subject to various risks and uncertainties including events beyond our control For example events that could cause a reduction in equity include without limitation a significant writedown of our goodwill Even if we are able to comply with this or other covenants the limitations on our operational and financial flexibility could harm our business by among other things limiting our ability to incur indebtedness or reduce equity in connection with financings or other corporate opportunities that we may believe would be in our best interests or the interests of our shareholders to complete 32 Table of Contents Disruptions in the capital markets or changes in our credit ratings could also limit our ability to access capital on terms favorable to us or at all For example o n April 1 2019 Moodys Investors Service changed the Companys senior unsecured debt rating to Baa1 from A3 with a stable outlook While the lending banks that participate in our revolving credit facility have met all of their obligations disruptions in the credit markets changes in our credit ratings or deterioration of the banking industrys financial condition could discourage or prevent lenders from meeting their existing lending commitments extending the terms of such commitments or agreeing to new commitments These or other occurrences may cause our lenders to not meet their existing commitments and we may not be able to access the commercial paper or loan or capital markets in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all Furthermore our inability to maintain renew or replace commitments under this facility could materially increase our cost of capital and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and liquidity Longerterm disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of economic legislative political or other uncertainty including as a result of changes in US tax and other laws reduced financing alternatives or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to the liquidity needed for our business Any significant disruption in the capital debt or credit markets or financial institution failures could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the market stabilizes or until alternative financing can be arranged Such measures could include deferring capital expenditures reducing or suspending dividend payments and reducing other discretionary expenditures Finally there is no assurance that we will be able to access the equity capital markets to obtain financing when necessary or desirable and on terms that are reasonable or acceptable to us Any of the foregoing events that impede our access to the capital markets or the failure of any of our lenders to meet their commitments that result from financial market disruptions could expose us to increased interest expense require us to institute cash conservation measures or otherwise adversely and materially affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity Parent company may be unable to meet its ongoing and future financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock if its subsidiaries are unable to pay upstream dividends or repay funds Parent company is a holding company and as such it has no substantive operations of its own Substantially all of our consolidated assets are held by subsidiaries Parent companys ability to meet its financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock is primarily dependent on the net income and cash flows of its subsidiaries and their ability to pay upstream dividends or repay indebtedness to parent company Prior to paying dividends to parent company our regulated subsidiaries must comply with applicable regulatory restrictions and financial obligations including for example debt service and preferred and preference stock dividends as well as applicable corporate tax and other laws and regulations and agreements and our covenants and other agreements Our subsidiaries are separate legal entities and have no obligation to pay or upstream dividends to parent company A failure or inability of any of these subsidiaries to pay such dividends or repay intercompany obligations could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and parent companys ability to pay dividends on its common stock and meet its other obligations We may not be able to fully utilize our US and state net operating loss carryforwards As of December 31 2019  we had US federal and state NOL carryforwards of approximately 673 million and 453 million  respectively and management believes it is more likely than not that these NOL carryforwards will be recovered in the future With the enactment of the TCJA the Company analyzed the impacts of the reduction in the US federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 on the Companys deferred tax assets and liabilities including its NOL carryforwards and as a result remeasured those NOL carryforwards as of the date of enactment of the TCJA based on this tax rate change Our federal NOL carryforwards will begin to expire in 2028  and our state NOL carryforwards began to expire in 2019 and will continue to expire through 2038 We expect to fully utilize our federal NOL balance before it expires and our ability to do so is primarily dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient taxable income We have in the past been unable to utilize certain of our state NOL carryforwards and the establishment or increase of a valuation allowance in the future would reduce our deferred income tax assets and our net income Our actual results may differ from those estimated by management in making its assessment as to our ability to use the NOL carryforwards Moreover adoption of Related Interpretations with respect to the TCJA and other changes in income tax laws the economy and the general business environment could affect the future utilization of our NOL carryforwards If we are unable to fully utilize our NOL carryforwards to offset taxable income generated in the future our financial position results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 33 Table of Contents We have recorded a significant amount of goodwill and we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets causing us to record impairments that may negatively affect our results of operations Our total assets include 15 billion of goodwill at December 31 2019  The goodwill is primarily associated with the acquisition of American Water by an affiliate of our previous owner in 2003 the acquisition of Etown Corporation by a predecessor to our previous owner in 2001 and our acquisition of Pivotal in 2018 Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price the purchaser paid over the fair value of the net tangible and other intangible assets acquired Goodwill is recorded at fair value on the date of an acquisition and is reviewed annually or more frequently if changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable As required by the applicable accounting rules we have taken significant noncash charges to operating results for goodwill impairments in the past We may be required to recognize an impairment of goodwill in the future due to market conditions or other factors related to our performance or the performance of an acquired business These market conditions could include a decline over a period of time of our stock price a decline over a period of time in valuation multiples of comparable water utilities market price performance of our common stock that compares unfavorably to our peer companies decreases in control premiums or other circumstances For example in the third quarter of 2018 prior to our sale of Keystone we strategically narrowed the scope of that business and as a result we recorded a noncash pretax impairment charge of 57 million  See Note 8Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information A decline in the results forecasted in our business plan due to events such as changes in rate case results capital investment budgets or interest rates could also result in an impairment charge Recognition of impairments of goodwill would result in a charge to income in the period in which the impairment occurred which may negatively affect our financial condition results of operations and total capitalization The effects of any such impairment could be material and could make it more difficult to maintain our credit ratings secure financing on attractive terms maintain compliance with debt covenants and meet the expectations of our regulators Market volatility and other conditions may impact the value of benefit plan assets and liabilities as well as assumptions related to the benefit plans which may require us to provide significant additional funding The performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy significant future obligations under our pension and postretirement benefit plans The value of these assets is subject to market fluctuations and volatility which may cause investment returns to fall below our projected return rates A decline in the market value of the pension and postretirement benefit plan assets can increase the funding requirements under our pension and postretirement benefit plans Additionally our pension and postretirement benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates If interest rates decrease our liabilities would increase potentially increasing benefit expense and funding requirements Further changes in demographics such as increases in life expectancy assumptions and increasing trends in health care costs may also increase our funding requirements Future increases in pension and other postretirement costs as a result of reduced plan assets may not be fully recoverable in rates in which case our results of operations and financial position could be negatively affected In addition market factors can affect assumptions we use in determining funding requirements with respect to our pension and postretirement plans For example a relatively modest change in our assumptions regarding discount rates can materially affect our calculation of funding requirements To the extent that market data compels us to reduce the discount rate used in our assumptions our benefit obligations could be materially increased which could adversely affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows New accounting standards or changes to existing accounting standards could materially impact how we report our results of operations cash flow and financial condition Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP The SEC the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other authoritative bodies or governmental entities may issue new pronouncements or new interpretations of existing accounting standards that may require us to change our accounting policies These changes are beyond our control can be difficult to predict and could materially impact how we report our results of operations cash flow and financial condition We could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively which could also adversely affect our previously reported results of operations cash flow and financial condition Undetected errors in internal controls and information reporting could result in the disallowance of cost recovery and noncompliant disclosure Our internal controls accounting policies and practices and internal information systems are designed to enable us to capture and process transactions and information in a timely and accurate manner in compliance with GAAP taxation requirements federal securities laws and regulations and other laws and regulations applicable to us Such compliance permits us to among other things disclose and report financial and other information in connection with the recovery of our costs and with the reporting requirements under federal securities tax and other laws and regulations 34 Table of Contents We have implemented corporate governance internal control and accounting policies and procedures in connection with the SarbanesOxley Act of 2002 the SarbanesOxley Act and relevant SEC rules as well as other applicable regulations Such internal controls and policies have been and continue to be closely monitored by our management and Board of Directors to ensure continued compliance with these laws rules and regulations Management is also responsible for establishing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting and is required to assess annually the effectiveness of these controls While we believe these controls policies practices and systems are adequate to verify data integrity unanticipated and unauthorized actions of employees or temporary lapses in internal controls due to shortfalls in oversight or resource constraints could lead to undetected errors that could result in the disallowance of cost recovery and noncompliant disclosure and reporting The consequences of these events could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition The inability of management to certify as to the effectiveness of these controls due to the identification of one or more material weaknesses in these controls could also harm our reputation increase financing costs or adversely affect our or AWCCs ability to access the capital markets Additional Risks Related to Our MarketBased Businesses We excluding our regulated subsidiaries provide performance guarantees with respect to certain obligations of our MarketBased Businesses  including financial guarantees or deposits to our publicsector and public clients and these clients may seek to enforce the guarantees if our MarketBased Businesses do not satisfy these obligations Under the terms of some of our agreements for the provision of services to water and wastewater facilities with municipalities other governmental entities and other customers American Water excluding our regulated subsidiaries provides guarantees of specified performance obligations of our MarketBased Businesses  including financial guarantees or deposits primarily related to MSG In the event our MarketBased Businesses fail to perform these obligations the entity holding the guarantees may seek to enforce the performance commitments against American Water excluding our regulated subsidiaries or proceed against the deposit In that event our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity could be adversely affected At December 31 2019  we had remaining performance commitments as measured by remaining contract revenue totaling approximately 54 billion related to MSGs contracts and this amount is likely to increase if the number of bases served by MSG increases The presence of these commitments may adversely affect our financial condition and make it more difficult for us to secure financing on attractive terms Our MarketBased Businesses operations under MSG are subject to various risks associated with doing business with the US government MSG enters into contracts with the US government for the operation and maintenance of water and wastewater systems which contracts may be terminated in whole or in part prior to the end of the 50year term for convenience of the US government or as a result of default or nonperformance by the subsidiary performing the contract In addition the contract price for each of these military contracts is typically subject to either an annual economic price adjustment or a redetermination two years after commencement of operations and every three years thereafter Annual economic price adjustment is an inflation indexbased contract price increase mechanism Price redetermination is a contract mechanism to periodically adjust the service fee in the next period to reflect changes in contract obligations and anticipated market conditions Any early contract termination or unfavorable annual economic price adjustment or price redetermination could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows Moreover entering into contracts with the US government subjects us to a number of operational and compliance risks including dependence on the level of government spending and compliance with and changes in governmental procurement and security regulations We are subject to potential government investigations of our business practices and compliance with government procurement and security regulations which are complex and compliance with these regulations can be expensive and burdensome If we were charged with wrongdoing as a result of an investigation we could be suspended or barred from bidding on or receiving awards of new contracts with the US government or our existing contracts could be terminated which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows ITEM 1B UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None 35 Table of Contents ITEM 2 PROPERTIES The Companys properties consist primarily of i water

Supply in Lieu of Carmel River Diversions Compliance with SWRCB Orders to Reduce Carmel River Diversions Under the 2009 Order Cal Am is required among other things to decrease significantly its yearly diversions of water from the Carmel River according to a set reduction schedule The 2009 Order responded to claims that Cal Am had not sufficiently implemented actions to terminate its unpermitted diversions of water from the Carmel River as required by a 1995 order of the SWRCB In July 2016 at the request of Cal Am and several Monterey County government agencies the SWRCB issued the 2016 Order approving the 2021 Deadline The 2009 Order includes a condition prohibiting Cal Am from diverting water from the Carmel River for new service connections or for any increased use of water at existing service addresses resulting from a change in zoning or use In 2011 the California Public Utilities Commission the CPUC issued a decision directing modifications in Cal Ams tariffs to recognize the moratorium mandated by the 2009 Order and directing Cal Am to seek written guidance from the SWRCB with respect to any unresolved issues of interpretation or implementation of this condition In 2012 the Deputy Director of the SWRCB sent a letter to Cal Am providing an interpretation as to the calculation of a baseline to determine increases in use of water at existing service addresses In March 2018 the MPWMD adopted a resolution directing Cal Am to interpret the baseline in a manner that conflicts with the SWRCBs written interpretation In May 2018 Cal Am notified the MPWMD and the SWRCB that it intends to seek declaratory relief concerning the conflicting regulatory interpretations under the 2009 Order In an attempt to resolve these conflicting interpretations prior to seeking judicial intervention Cal Am has met with the MPWMD and the SWRCB several times The SWRCB agreed to circulate revisions to its 2012 interpretive letter which would be subject to a public comment period Any failure to follow the MPWMDs resolution or the SWRCBs written interpretation despite these conflicting interpretations could potentially result in fines penalties and other actions against Cal Am 36 Table of Contents The 2016 Order provides that if the CPUC authorizes Cal Am to acquire more than 1000 acrefeet per year of water from a source other than the Water Supply Project proponents of the alternative water source could submit revised milestones to the SWRCB for consideration In May 2018 certain parties to the Water Supply Project proceeding submitted a petition to the SWRCB to add parallel milestones to the 2009 Order for 2019 2020 and 2021 based on the proposed expansion of the Pure Water Monterey project another groundwater replenishment project under construction on the Monterey peninsula Petitioners claim that compliance with the alternate milestones would still provide for cessation of Cal Ams unauthorized diversions from the Carmel River by 2021 A preliminary report on feasibility concluded that the expanded Pure Water Monterey project could provide an additional 2250 acrefeet of water per year Cal Am believes that i the petition is premature ii the expanded Pure Water Monterey project is not yet a sufficiently certain or reliable water supply and even if construction is successfully completed would provide an insufficient quantity of water to allow full compliance with the 2009 Order and iii the imposition of parallel milestones would distract from completion of the Water Supply Project On December 13 2019 the SWRCB dismissed the petition without prejudice Cal Am continues to work constructively with all appropriate agencies to provide necessary information in connection with obtaining required approvals for the Water Supply Project However based on the matters discussed below in Monterey Peninsula Water Supply Project there can be no assurance that the Water Supply Project in its current configuration will be completed on a timely basis if ever Due to the delay in the approval schedule Cal Am currently does not believe that it will be able to fully comply with the diversion reduction requirements and other remaining requirements under the 2009 Order and the 2016 Order including the 2021 Deadline The CPUCs final decision approving the Water Supply Project permits recovery of all of Cal Ams prudently incurred costs associated therewith subject to the frameworks set forth in the final decision related to cost caps OM costs financing ratemaking and contingency matters Cal Am currently believes that its expenditures to date have been prudent and necessary to comply with the 2009 Order and the 2016 Order Further attempts to comply with the 2009 Order and the 2016 Order or the 2021 Deadline may result in material additional costs or obligations to Cal Am and failure to comply could lead to fines and penalties against Cal Am Regional Desalination Project Litigation Review of CPUCApproved Settlement Agreement The Regional Desalination Project the RDP involved the construction of a desalination facility in the City of Marina north of Monterey The RDP was intended to among other things eliminate unauthorized diversions from the Carmel River as required under the 2009 Order In December 2010 the CPUC approved the RDP which was to be implemented through a Water Purchase Agreement and ancillary agreements collectively the Agreements among the Marina Coast Water District MCWD the Monterey County Water Resources Agency MCWRA and Cal Am In 2011 due to a conflict of interest concerning a former member of MCWRAs Board of Directors MCWRA stated that the Agreements were void and as a result Cal Am terminated the Agreements In April 2015 the CPUC approved a settlement agreement among Cal Am MCWRA and the County of Monterey to resolve these matters among the parties signing the agreement In March 2016 the Supreme Court of California granted MCWDs petition for review of the CPUC approval and following the courts disposition of a related issue in another case MCWDs petition for review of the CPUCapproved settlement agreement was remanded to the CPUC On September 19 2019 the CPUC issued a decision affirming its prior decisions with respect to the settlement agreement that resolved matters among the parties thereto associated with the termination of the RDP agreements after considering the issue remanded by the California Supreme Court Cal Ams Action for Damages Following RDP Termination In October 2012 Cal Am filed a Complaint for Declaratory Relief against MCWRA and MCWD which was ultimately transferred to the San Francisco County Superior Court seeking a determination as to whether the Agreements are void as a result of the alleged conflict of interest In June 2015 the court entered a final judgment agreeing with Cal Ams position that four of the five Agreements are void and one the credit line agreement is not void In November 2016 the Supreme Court of California denied MCWDs final appeal of this judgment which allows further proceedings discussed below to determine the amount of damages that may be awarded in the proceeding In July 2015 Cal Am and MCWRA filed a Complaint in San Francisco County Superior Court against MCWD and RMC Water and Environment RMC a private engineering consulting firm which has since been acquired by a national engineering science and operations company seeking to recover compensatory damages in excess of 10 million associated with the failure of the RDP as well as punitive and treble damages statutory penalties and attorneys fees Shortly thereafter complaints seeking similar damages were filed in the same court by MCWD and RMC against Cal Am and MCWRA in excess of 19 million in the aggregate In December 2015 the court consolidated all of these complaints into a single action On February 15 2019 the court granted Cal Ams motion for summary judgment and as a result no claims remain pending against Cal Am in this action On February 25 2019 the court granted RMCs motion for judgment on the pleadings as to certain of Cal Ams tort claims against it On June 20 2019 the court granted MCWDs motion for summary judgment related to Cal Ams tort claims against MCWD which Cal Am appealed to the California Court of Appeal and on January 14 2020 this appeal was denied On January 17 2019 a motion filed by MCWD for summary judgment against Cal Am relating to the contract claims in Cal Ams complaint was denied 37 Table of Contents Trial in this lawsuit had been scheduled to take place in January 2020 On January 27 2020 the parties to this lawsuit reached a tentative agreement which was entered into the court record and would resolve the litigation in part without trial Under the terms of this tentative agreement MCWD and RMC would pay Cal Am an aggregate of 52 million in settlement of Cal Ams contract claims against MCWD and all claims against RMC relating to the RDP Under this agreement Cal Ams and MCWRAs right to appeal the dismissal of their tort claims against MCWD would be expressly reserved A draft settlement agreement is being reviewed and negotiated by the parties Once executed the settlement agreement would be subject to approval of the San Francisco County Superior Court Monterey Peninsula Water Supply Project CPUC Final Approval of Water Supply Project Cal Ams ability to move forward on the Water Supply Project is and has been subject to extensive administrative review by the CPUC and other government agencies obtaining necessary permits and intervention from other parties In September 2016 the CPUC unanimously approved a decision to authorize Cal Am to enter into a water purchase agreement for the GWR Project and to construct a pipeline and pump station facilities and recover up to 50 million in associated costs subject to meeting certain criteria If construction costs exceed 50 million Cal Am would be allowed to seek additional cost recovery In September 2018 the CPUC unanimously adopted a final decision finding that i the Water Supply Project based on Cal Ams request for a 64 million gallons per day desalination plant meets the CPUCs requirements for a CPCN ii the issuance of the final decision should not be delayed and iii an additional procedural phase was not necessary to consider alternative projects The CPUCs decision directs Cal Am to enter into negotiations regarding expansion of the GWR Project between Monterey One Water and the MPWMD and to indicate whether Cal Am plans to file an application for approval of an agreement to purchase additional water from the GWR Project The decision notes however that the CPUC will only consider such an application if the Water Supply Project is delayed such that Cal Am would not be able to meet the 2021 Deadline The decision accepts Cal Ams estimates of future water demand in Monterey and concludes that the Water Supply Project is the best project to address those needs and adopts Cal Ams most recent cost estimates The decision also allows Cal Am to earn an allowance for funds used during construction or AFUDC at a rate representative of its actual financing costs The final decision adopted frameworks as to cost caps OM costs financing ratemaking and contingency matters In addition the CPUC final decision imposes numerous reporting and filing requirements to ensure the expenditures for the Water Supply Project are reasonable including that the financing is the lowest cost and most beneficial for ratepayers and that construction is progressing in a timely manner and within the authorized cost caps The reasonableness of Water Supply Project costs will be reviewed in the first general rate case filed by Cal Am after the Water Supply Project becomes operational Cal Am is also required to implement mitigation measures to avoid minimize or offset significant environmental impacts from the construction and operation of the Water Supply Project and comply with a mitigation monitoring and reporting program a reimbursement agreement for CPUC costs associated with that program and reporting requirements on plant operations following placement of the Water Supply Project in service In February 2019 the City of Marina and MCWD filed petitions for writ of review before the Supreme Court of California challenging the sufficiency of the final Environmental Impact ReportEnvironmental Impact Statement adopted by the CPUC in September 2018 which the court declined to consider on August 28 2019 On July 2 2019 Cal Am notified MPWMD and Monterey One Water collectively the Agencies that an event of default occurred under the water purchase agreement for the GWR Project because the Agencies failed to deliver to Cal Am by July 1 2019 advanced treated recycled water produced by the GWR Project Under the water purchase agreement upon the occurrence of this event of default Cal Am had the right to terminate the water purchase

application to the City of Marina for those project components of the Water Supply Project located within the City of Marinas coastal zone Members of the Citys Planning Commission as well as City councilpersons have publicly expressed opposition to the Water Supply Project On March 7 2019 the City of Marina Planning Commission adopted a resolution denying Cal Ams coastal development permit

City challenging the impartiality of the City and three of its council members with respect to the Water Supply Project On April 29 2019 the City informed Cal Am that it intended to proceed with the hearing with the participation of the challenged City Council members As a result on April 29 2019 Cal Am notified the City that it was withdrawing its appeal as Cal Am believes it could not receive a fair and impartial hearing before the City Council On May 10 2019 the City issued a notice of final local action based upon the Marina Planning Commissions decision On May 22 2019 Cal Am appealed this decision to the California Coastal Commission the Coastal Commission as permitted under the Citys code and the California Coastal Act On October 28 2019 staff of the Coastal Commission issued a report recommending a denial of Cal Ams application for a coastal development permit with respect to the Water Supply Project largely based on a memorandum prepared by the general manager of the MPWMD that contradicted findings made by the CPUC in its final decision approving the Water Supply Project Staffs of the CPUC and the Coastal Commission met to discuss the Coastal Commissions staff recommendation at which time the CPUC raised questions about the Coastal Commission staffs findings on water supply and demand groundwater impacts and other matters On November 4 2019 Coastal Commission staff released an addendum to the staff report concluding that additional groundwater modeling was needed before staff could find that the Water Supply Project would not prevent depletion of groundwater supplies At its November 14 2019 hearing on both the appeal from the City of Marinas denial and Cal Ams application for a coastal development permit within the Coastal Commissions original jurisdiction Coastal Commission staff advised that no vote would be taken at the meeting and that further investigation was required in light of the CPUC staffs questions The hearing was continued to a later date On January 28 2020 Coastal Commission staff recommended to Cal Am that it withdraw its application for a coastal development permit within the Coastal Commissions original jurisdiction and resubmit such application at a later date as the staff believes that its additional investigation could not be completed in time for a vote on Cal Ams existing application The staff indicated that such a withdrawal would not affect Cal Ams appeal of the City of Marins denial which would remain pending Cal Am has declined to withdraw its application and instead on February 12 2020 Cal Am and the Coastal Commission entered into a stipulation extending by 90 days to July 24 2020 the deadline for the Coastal Commission to vote on Cal Ams original jurisdiction application Desalination Plant Development Permit The proposed desalination plant for the Water Supply Project is to be located in an unincorporated portion of Monterey County California on a site owned by CEMEX Inc CEMEX and requires a combined development permit from the County of Monterey prior to commencement of construction On April 24 2019 the Countys Planning Commission voted to approve the permit On

approval of the combined development permit precluding commencement of physical construction of the desalination plant until November 19 2019 at which time the parties were to advise the court of the Coastal Commissions decision on Cal Ams application for a coastal development permit for the slant wells needed to source water for the desalination plant In the interim Cal Am is allowed to continue to obtain permits needed for the desalination plants construction On November 19 2019 the parties informed the court that the Coastal Commission had continued its public hearing on the slant wells and had not yet made a determination about permitting the slant wells In response the court continued its stay until March 24 2020 39 Table of Contents Proposed Zoning Changes at CEMEX Site for Slant Wells In August 2018 the City circulated a public review draft of proposed amendments to its local coastal program and zoning ordinance and placed the matter for consideration on the Planning Commissions agenda for its September 2018 meeting The proposed amendments would change zoning at the CEMEX site to open space and restrict future uses including with respect to Cal Ams planned use of the site for the slant wells for the Water Supply Project Any change to the Citys local coastal program must ultimately be approved by the Coastal Commission Cal Am CEMEX and the Coastal Commission each submitted letters opposing the proposed amendments At its November 2018 meeting the Planning Commission adopted a resolution recommending that the Marina City Council consider approving the amendments In December 2018 the Marina City Council considered the proposed amendments Cal Am CEMEX and the Coastal Commission again submitted letters opposing the proposed changes but the City Council unanimously adopted a resolution amending its local coastal plan and a draft amendment to its zoning ordinance Changes to the ordinance require a second reading before becoming final which occurred at the Citys December 2018 meeting The changes to the local coastal plan must be submitted to the Coastal Commission for approval and are not effective until such approval is obtained Test Slant Well Permitting A preliminary step to building the Water Supply Project desalination plant is the construction and operation of a test slant well to confirm the suitability of the property on which intake wells will be located to draw water from under Monterey Bay In November 2014 the Coastal Commission approved coastal development permits for the test slant well enabling Cal Am to construct and operate the test slant well Because Cal Am may use the test slant well as one of the slant wells for the Water Supply Project Cal Am sought and obtained from the Coastal Commission permit amendments to allow the test slant well to remain in place and be maintained until February 28 2020 On November 27 2019 Cal Am filed an application with the Coastal Commission for a permit amendment to allow the test slant well to remain in place and be maintained until February 28 2021 A required lease obtained from the California State Lands Commission as amended will expire on December 16 2022 Effective February 28 2018 test slant well pumping ceased except for minimal maintenance pumping activities in accordance with Cal Ams coastal development permits In November 2015 MCWD filed a Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief in Santa Cruz County Superior Court against the Coastal Commission and Cal Am challenging the amendment of the coastal development permits and seeking an injunction against further test well pumping In orders issued in September 2016 and October 2017 the court denied MCWDs challenges In January 2018 MCWD filed a notice of appeal of the courts judgment On June 28 2019 the California Court of Appeal dismissed MCWDs appeal On July 15 2019 MCWD filed a petition for rehearing with the Court of Appeal which was denied on July 19 2019 This decision is now final Water Supply Project Land Acquisition and Slant Well Site Use In July 2017 the Coastal Commission adopted a consent agreement and cease and desist order requiring sand mining operations on the property owned by CEMEX on which intake wells for the Water Supply Project will be located to cease by the end of 2020 and the property to be sold to either a nonprofit or governmental entity The consent agreement strictly limits future use of the property but preserves Cal Ams existing property rights and allows uses consistent with existing easements and other rights of record A permanent easement granted by CEMEX to Cal Am was recorded in June 2018 to allow Cal Am access to the property and to construct operate and maintain the Water Supply Project intake wells On November 26 2019 the City of Marina notified CEMEX that based on this easement and Cal Ams proposed use of the site for the intake wells CEMEX has breached or will soon breach a prior 1996 annexation agreement to which Cal Am was not a party The City states that it intends to seek declaratory relief from CEMEX and Cal Am ordering that Cal Ams extraction is limited to 500 acrefeet per year of groundwater that Cal Am cannot export extracted water out of the basin and that the permanent easement granted by CEMEX to Cal Am is void The City has requested a meeting with CEMEX as part of a mandatory dispute resolution process under the annexation agreement prior to filing a lawsuit CEMEX has denied the Citys claims and requested indemnification from Cal Am under the terms of the permanent easement Cal Am and CEMEX believe that there is no valid limitation under the annexation agreement on Cal Ams right to pump brackish groundwater and seawater at the site for desalination and use by Cal Ams customers Under Californias Sustainable Groundwater Management Act SGMA enacted in 2015 groundwater basins designated by the state as critically overdrafted must be managed by a groundwater sustainability agency GSA by 2020 in accordance with an approved groundwater sustainability plan GSP designed to achieve sustainability by 2040 Under the SGMA GSAs have broad powers to achieve sustainability including but not limited to regulating groundwater extraction by imposing fees on groundwater extractions and controlling groundwater extractions by regulating limiting or suspending extractions from wells The 400acre CEMEX site overlies a small portion of the 180400 Subbasin of the Salinas Valley Groundwater Basin the 84000acre 180400 Subbasin has been designated by the state as critically overdrafted mainly due to seawater intrusion into the subbasin 40 Table of Contents In late 2016 the Salinas Valley Basin Groundwater Sustainability Agency SVBGSA was formed as a joint powers authority to become the GSA for the Salinas Valley Groundwater Basin and prepare a GSP In April 2018 the City of Marina filed a notice to become the GSA for the CEMEX site creating an overlap with the SVBGSAs filing for the 180400 Subbasin In 2016 the SVBGSA commenced preparation of a GSP covering the entire 180400 subbasin including the CEMEX site but in August 2019 the City filed a notice that it intends to prepare its own GSP for the CEMEX site with the intent to severely limit or prohibit groundwater pumping at that site The State Department of Water Resources SDWR has taken the position that until the overlap is resolved it will not accept the GSP from either agency placing the subbasin at risk of being placed in a probationary status and subject to state management In December 2019 the County of Monterey filed its own notice to become the exclusive GSA at the CEMEX site in order to resolve the overlap which is permitted under SGMA SDWR accepted the Countys filing on December 18 2019 and now lists the County as the exclusive GSA for the site On December 30 2019 the City of Marina filed a lawsuit in the Supreme Court of California challenging the Countys filing and SDWRs acceptance of the filing as the exclusive GSA for the CEMEX site The City has named the County and its Board of Supervisors the County GSA and SDWR and its director as defendants and the SVBGSA and its Board of Directors as real parties The City seeks to invalidate the Countys filing as well as injunctive relief to preserve the Citys status as a GSA for the site To protect its interest in the matter Cal Am filed an application to intervene in this lawsuit which is scheduled to be heard on February 18 2020 West Virginia Elk River Freedom Industries Chemical Spill
