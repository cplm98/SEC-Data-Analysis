assortment experienced parts professionals Professional programs that are designed to build loyalty with our customers and our DIY customer loyalty program Speed Perks Our DIY campaign was developed around a multichannel communications plan that brings together radio television direct marketing social media sponsorships store events and Speed Perks Seasonality Our business is somewhat seasonal in nature with the highest sales usually occurring in the spring and summer months In addition our business can be affected by weather conditions While unusually heavy precipitation tends to soften sales as elective maintenance is deferred during such periods extremely hot or cold weather tends to enhance sales by causing automotive parts to fail at an accelerated rate Our fourth quarter is generally our most volatile as weather and spending tradeoffs typically influence our Professional and DIY sales Team Members As of December 29 2018  we employed approximately 40000 fulltime Team Members and approximately 31000 parttime Team Members Our workforce consisted of 85 of our Team Members employed in storelevel operations 11 employed in distribution and 4 employed in our corporate offices As of

trademarks including Advance Auto Parts Autopart International Carquest CARQUEST Technical Institute DriverSide MotoLogic MotoShop Worldpac speedDIAL and TECHNET Professional Auto Service for use in connection with the automotive parts business In addition we own and have registered a number of trademarks for our private label brands We believe that these trade names service marks and trademarks are important to our merchandising strategy We do not know of any infringing uses that would materially affect the use of these trade names and marks and we actively defend and enforce them 4 Table of Contents Competition We operate in both the Professional and DIY markets of the automotive aftermarket industry Our primary competitors are i both national and regional chains of automotive parts stores including AutoZone Inc NAPA OReilly Automotive Inc The Pep BoysManny Moe  Jack and Auto Plus formerly UniSelect USA Inc ii discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry automotive products iii wholesalers or jobber stores including those associated with national parts distributors or associations iv independently owned stores v automobile dealers that supply parts and vi internetbased retailers We believe that chains of automotive parts stores that like us have multiple locations in one or more markets have competitive advantages in customer service marketing inventory selection purchasing and distribution as compared to independent retailers and jobbers that are not part of a chain or associated with other retailers or jobbers The principal methods of competition in our business include customer service product offerings availability quality price and store location Environmental Matters We are subject to various federal state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to the operation of our business including those governing collection transportation and recycling of automotive leadacid batteries used motor oil and other recyclable items and ownership and operation of real property We sell products containing hazardous materials as part of our business In addition our customers may bring automotive leadacid batteries used motor oil or other recyclable items onto our properties We currently provide collection and recycling programs for used leadacid batteries used oil and other recyclable items at a majority of our stores as a service to our customers Pursuant to agreements with thirdparty vendors leadacid batteries used motor oil and other recyclable items are collected by our Team Members deposited onto pallets or into vendor supplied containers and stored by us until collected by the third party vendors for recycling or proper disposal The terms of our contracts with third party vendors require that they are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations Our thirdparty vendors who arrange for the removal disposal treatment or other handling of hazardous or toxic substances may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation at any affected disposal treatment or other site affected by such substances Based on our experience we do not believe that there are any material environmental costs associated with the current business practice of accepting leadacid batteries used oil and other recyclable items as these costs are borne by the respective thirdparty vendors We own and lease real property Under various environmental laws and regulations a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on under or in such property These laws often impose joint and several liability and may be imposed without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the release of such hazardous or toxic substances Other environmental laws and common law principles also could be used to impose liability for releases of hazardous materials into the environment or work place and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury or property damage associated with exposure to released hazardous substances From time to time we receive notices from the US Environmental Protection Agency and state environmental authorities indicating that there may be contamination on properties we own lease or operate or may have owned leased or operated in the past or on adjacent properties for which we may be responsible Compliance with these laws and regulations and cleanup of released hazardous substances have not had a material impact on our operations to date Available Information Our Internet address is wwwAdvanceAutoPartscom Our website and the information contained therein or linked thereto are not part of this Annual Report on Form 10K for 2018 We make available free of charge through our Internet website our annual reports on Form 10K quarterly reports on Form 10Q current reports on Form 8K proxy statements registration statements and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with or furnish them to the SEC The SEC maintains a website that contains reports proxy statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC These materials may be obtained electronically by accessing the SECs website at wwwsecgov 5 Table of Contents Item 1A Risk Factors Our business is subject to a variety of risks Our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted by the following risk factors These risks are not the only risks that may impact our business If overall demand for the products we sell declines our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows will suffer Decreased demand could also negatively impact our stock price Overall demand for products sold by our stores depends on many factors and may decrease due to any number of reasons including  a decrease in the total number of vehicles on the road or in the number of annual miles driven or significant increase in the use of ridesharing services  because fewer vehicles means less maintenance and repairs and lower vehicle mileage which decreases the need for maintenance and repair  the economy  because during periods of declining economic conditions and rising interest rates consumers may reduce their discretionary spending by deferring vehicle maintenance or repair and new car purchases which may impact the number of cars requiring repair in the future  the weather because milder weather conditions may lower the failure rates of automobile parts while extended periods of rain and winter precipitation may cause our customers to defer elective maintenance and repair of their vehicles  the average duration of vehicle manufacturer warranties and average age of vehicles being driven because newer cars typically require fewer repairs and will be repaired by the manufacturers dealer networks using dealer parts pursuant to warranties which have gradually increased in duration andor mileage expiration over the recent past while vehicles that are seven years old and older are generally no longer covered under manufacturers warranties and tend to need more maintenance and repair than newer vehicles  an increase in internetbased retailers  because potentially favorable prices and ease of use of purchasing parts via other websites on the internet may decrease the need for customers to visit and purchase their aftermarket parts from our physical stores and may cause fewer customers to order aftermarket parts on our website  technological advances such as battery electric vehicles and the increase in quality of vehicles manufactured  because vehicles that need less frequent maintenance or have lower part failure rates will require less frequent repairs using aftermarket parts and in the case of battery electric vehicles do not require oil changes and  the refusal of vehicle manufacturers to make available diagnostic repair and maintenance information to the automotive aftermarket industry that our Professional and DIY customers require to diagnose repair and maintain their vehicles  because this may force consumers to have a majority of diagnostic work repairs and maintenance performed by the vehicle manufacturers dealer networks If we are unable to compete successfully against other companies in the automotive aftermarket industry we may lose customers and our revenues may decline The sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive and influenced by a number of factors including name recognition location price quality product availability and customer service We compete in both the Professional and DIY categories of the automotive aftermarket industry primarily with i national and regional chains of automotive parts stores ii internetbased retailers iii discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry automotive products iv wholesalers or jobbers stores including those associated with national parts distributors or associations v independently owned stores and vi automobile dealers that supply parts These competitors and the level of competition vary by market Some of our competitors may possess advantages over us in certain markets we share including with respect to the level of marketing activities number of stores store locations store layouts operating histories name recognition established customer bases vendor relationships prices and product warranties Internetbased retailers may possess cost advantages over us due to lower overhead costs time and travel savings and ability to price competitively In order to compete favorably we may need to increase delivery speeds and incur higher shipping costs Consolidation among our competitors could enhance their market share and financial position provide them with the ability to achieve better purchasing terms and allow them to provide more competitive prices to customers for whom we compete In addition our reputation is critical to our continued success Customers are increasingly shopping reading reviews and comparing products and prices online If we fail to maintain high standards for or receive negative publicity whether through social media or traditional media channels relating to product safety and quality or our integrity and reputation we could lose customers to our competition The product we sell is branded both in brands of our vendors and in our own private label brands If the perceived quality or value of the brands we sell declines in the eyes of our customers our results of operations could be negatively affected 6 Table of Contents Competition may require us to reduce our prices below our normal selling prices or increase our promotional spending which could lower our revenue and profitability Competitive disadvantages may also prevent us from introducing new product lines require us to discontinue current product offerings or change some of our current operating strategies If we do not have the resources expertise and consistent execution or otherwise fail to develop successful strategies to address these potential competitive disadvantages we may lose customers our revenues and profit margins may decline and we may be less profitable or potentially unprofitable If we are unable to successfully implement our business strategy including increasing sales to Professional and DIY customers expanding our margins and increasing our return on invested capital our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected We have identified numerous initiatives as part of our business strategy to increase sales to both Professional and DIY customers and expand our margins in order to increase our earnings and cash flows If we are unable to implement these initiatives efficiently and effectively our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected For a description of select initiatives see Note 4 Exit Activities and Other Initiatives of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein Our inventory and ability to meet customer expectations may be adversely impacted by factors out or our control For that portion of our inventory manufactured andor sourced outside the United States geopolitical changes changes in trade regulations or tariff rates currency fluctuations work stoppages labor strikes port delays civil unrest natural disasters pandemics and other factors beyond our control may increase the cost of items we purchase or create shortages that could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability In addition unanticipated changes in consumer preferences or any unforeseen hurdles to meeting our customers needs for automotive products particularly parts availability in a timely manner could undermine our business strategy If we are unable to successfully implement our growth strategy keep existing store locations or open new locations in desirable places on favorable terms it could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows We intend to continue to expand the markets we serve as part of our growth strategy which may include opening new stores or branches as well as expansion of our online business We may also grow our business through strategic acquisitions We do not know whether the implementation of our growth strategy will be successful As we expand our market presence through various means it becomes more critical that we have consistent and effective execution across all of our Companys locations and brands We are unsure whether we will be able to open and operate new locations on a timely or sufficiently profitable basis or that opening new locations in markets we already serve will not harm the profitability or comparable store sales of existing locations The newly opened and existing locations profitability will depend on the competition we face as well as our ability to properly stock market and price the products desired by customers in these markets The actual number and format of any new locations to be opened and the success of our growth strategy will depend on a number of factors including among other things  the availability of desirable locations  the negotiation of acceptable lease or purchase terms for new locations  the availability of financial resources including access to capital at costeffective interest rates  our ability to expand our online offerings and sales and  our ability to manage the expansion and to hire train and retain qualified Team Members We compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations for our stores Local land use and zoning regulations environmental regulations and other regulatory requirements may impact our ability to find suitable locations and influence the cost of constructing renovating and operating our stores In addition real estate zoning construction and other delays may adversely affect store openings and renovations and increase our costs Further changing local demographics at existing store locations may adversely affect revenue and profitability levels at those stores The termination or expiration of leases at existing store locations may adversely affect us if the renewal terms of those leases are unacceptable to us and we are forced to close or relocate stores If we determine to close or relocate a store subject to a lease we may remain obligated under the applicable lease for the balance of the lease term In addition to potentially incurring costs related to lease obligations we may also incur severance or other facility closure costs for stores that are closed or relocated 7 Table of Contents If we are unable to successfully integrate future acquisitions into our existing operations it could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows We also expect to continue to make strategic acquisitions an element of our growth strategy Acquisitions involve certain risks that could cause our growth and profitability to differ from our expectations The success of our acquisitions depends on a number of factors including among other things  our ability to continue to identify and acquire suitable targets or to acquire additional companies at favorable prices and on other favorable terms  our ability to obtain the full benefits envisioned by strategic relationships  the risk that managements attention may be distracted  our ability to retain key personnel from acquired businesses  our ability to successfully integrate the operations and systems of the acquired companies and achieve the strategic operational financial or other anticipated synergies of the acquisition  we may incur significant transaction and integration costs in connection with acquisitions that may not be offset by the synergies achieved from the acquisition in the near term or at all and  we may assume or become subject to loss contingencies known or unknown of the acquired companies which could relate to past present or future facts events circumstances or occurrences If we experience difficulties implementing various information systems including our new enterprise resource planning system ERP our ability to conduct or business could be negatively impacted We are dependent on information systems to facilitate the daytoday operations of the business and to produce timely accurate and reliable information on financial and operational results We are in process of implementing various information systems including a new ERP These implementations will require significant investment of human and financial resources and we may experience significant delays increased costs and other difficulties with these projects Any significant disruption or deficiency in the design and implementation of these information systems could adversely affect our ability to process orders ship product send invoices and track payments fulfill contractual obligations or otherwise operate our business While we have invested meaningful resources in planning project management and training additional and serious implementation issues may arise as we integrate onto these new information systems that may disrupt our operations and negatively impact our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows If we are unable to maintain adequate supply chain capacity and improve supply chain efficiency we will not be able to expand our business which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows Our store inventories are primarily replenished by shipments from our network of distribution centers warehouses and HUB stores As we expand our market presence we will need to increase the efficiency and maintain adequate capacity of our supply chain network in order to achieve the business goal of reducing inventory costs while improving availability and movement of goods throughout our supply chain to meet consumer product needs and channel preferences We continue to streamline and optimize our supply chain network and systems and cannot be assured of our ability to increase the productivity and efficiency of our overall supply chain network to desired levels If we fail to effectively utilize our existing supply chain or if our investments in our supply chain do not provide the anticipated benefits we could experience suboptimal inventory levels or increases in our costs which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows We are dependent on our suppliers to supply us with products that comply with safety and quality standards at competitive prices We are dependent on our vendors continuing to supply us quality products on payment terms that are favorable to us If our merchandise offerings do not meet our customers expectations regarding safety and quality we could experience lost sales increased costs and exposure to legal and reputational risk All of our suppliers must comply with applicable product safety laws and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety and quality standards Events that give rise to actual potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to government enforcement action and private litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities To the extent our suppliers are subject to additional government regulation of their product design andor manufacturing processes the cost of the merchandise we purchase may rise In addition negative customer perceptions regarding the safety or quality of the products we sell could cause our customers to seek alternative sources for their needs resulting in lost sales In those circumstances it may be difficult and costly for us to regain the confidence of our customers 8 Table of Contents Our reliance on suppliers subjects us to various risks and uncertainties which could affect our financial results We source the products we sell from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers Our financial results depend on us securing acceptable terms with our suppliers for among other things the price of merchandise we purchase from them funding for various forms of promotional programs payment terms and terms covering returns and factory warranties To varying degrees our suppliers may be able to leverage their competitive advantages  for example their financial strength the strength of their brand with customers their own stores or online channels or their relationships with other retailers  to our commercial disadvantage Generally our ability to negotiate favorable terms with our suppliers is more difficult with suppliers for whom our purchases represent a smaller proportion of their total revenues consequently impacting our profitability from such vendor relationships We have established standards for product safety and quality and workplace standards that we require all our suppliers to meet We do not condone human trafficking forced labor child labor harassment or abuse of any kind and we expect our suppliers to operate within these same principles Our ability to find qualified suppliers who can supply products in a timely and efficient manner that meet our standards can be challenging Suppliers may also fail to invest adequately in design production or distribution facilities may reduce their customer incentives advertising and promotional activities or change their pricing policies If we encounter any of these issues with our suppliers our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted Deterioration of general macroeconomic conditions including unemployment inflation or deflation consumer debt levels high fuel and energy costs could have a negative impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows due to impacts on our suppliers customers and operating costs Our business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our suppliers and on our suppliers ability and willingness to sell quality products to us at favorable prices and terms Many factors outside our control may harm these relationships and the ability or willingness of these suppliers to sell us products on favorable terms Such factors include a general decline in the economy and economic conditions and prolonged recessionary conditions These events could negatively affect our suppliers operations and make it difficult for them to obtain the credit lines or loans necessary to finance their operations in the shortterm or longterm and meet our product requirements Financial or operational difficulties that some of our suppliers may face could also increase the cost of the products we purchase from them or our ability to source product from them We might not be able to pass our increased costs onto our customers If our suppliers fail to develop new products we may not be able to meet the demands of our customers and our results of operations could be negatively affected In addition the trend towards consolidation among automotive parts suppliers as well as the offshoring of manufacturing capacity to foreign countries may disrupt or end our relationship with some suppliers and could lead to less competition and result in higher prices We could also be negatively impacted by suppliers who might experience bankruptcies work stoppages labor strikes changes in foreign or domestic trade policies changes in tariff rates or other interruptions to or difficulties in the manufacture or supply of the products we purchase from them Deterioration in macroeconomic conditions or an increase in fuel costs or proposed or additional tariffs may have a negative impact on our customers net worth financial resources disposable income or willingness or ability to pay for accessories maintenance or repair for their vehicles resulting in lower sales in our stores An increase in fuel costs may also reduce the overall number of miles driven by our customers resulting in fewer parts failures and a reduced need for elective maintenance Rising energy prices also directly impact our operating and product costs including our store supply chain Professional delivery utility and product acquisition costs We depend on the services of many qualified executives and other Team Members whom we may not be able to attract develop and retain Our success depends to a significant extent on the continued services and experience of our executives and other Team Members We may not be able to retain our current executives and other key Team Members or attract and retain additional qualified executives and Team Members who may be needed in the future We must also continue to motivate employees and keep them focused on our strategies and goals Our ability to maintain an adequate number of executive and other qualified Team Members is highly dependent on an attractive and competitive compensation and benefits package In addition less than one percent of our Team Members are represented by unions If these Team Members were to engage in a strike work stoppage or other slowdown or if the terms and conditions in labor agreements were renegotiated we could experience a disruption in our operations and higher ongoing labor costs If we fail or are unable to maintain competitive compensation our customer service and execution levels could suffer by reason of a declining quality of our workforce which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 9 Table of Contents The market price of our common stock may be volatile and could expose us to securities class action litigation The stock market and the price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations based upon general economic and market conditions Downturns in the stock market may cause the price of our common stock to decline The market price of our stock may also be affected by our ability to meet analysts expectations Failure to meet such expectations even slightly could have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock In the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a companys securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such a company If similar litigation were instituted against us it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our attention and resources which could have an adverse effect on our business Our level of indebtedness a downgrade in our credit ratings or a deterioration in global credit markets could limit the cash flow available for operations and could adversely affect our ability to service our debt or obtain additional financing Our level of indebtedness could restrict our operations and make it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations For example our level of indebtedness could among other things  affect our liquidity by limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  limit our ability to obtain financing for capital expenditures and acquisitions or make any available financing more costly  require us to dedicate all or a substantial portion of our cash flow to service our debt which would reduce funds available for other business purposes such as capital expenditures dividends or acquisitions  limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in the markets in which we compete  place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors who may have less indebtedness  render us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions and  make it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations The indenture governing our notes and credit agreement governing our credit facilities contain financial and other restrictive covenants Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of all of our debt including such notes In addition our overall credit rating may be negatively impacted by deteriorating and uncertain credit markets or other factors that may or may not be within our control The interest rates on our publicly issued debt and revolving credit facility are linked directly to our credit ratings Accordingly any negative impact on our credit ratings would likely result in higher interest rates and interest expense on any borrowings under our revolving credit facility or future issuances of public debt and less favorable terms on other operating and financing arrangements In addition it could reduce the attractiveness of certain vendor payment programs whereby thirdparty institutions finance arrangements to our vendors based on our credit rating which could result in increased working capital requirements Conditions and events in the global credit market could have a material adverse effect on our access to short and longterm borrowings to finance our operations and the terms and cost of that debt It is possible that one or more of the banks that provide us with financing under our revolving credit facility may fail to honor the terms of our existing credit facility or be financially unable to provide the unused credit as a result of significant deterioration in such banks financial condition An inability to obtain sufficient financing at costeffective rates could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 10 Table of Contents Because we are involved in litigation from time to time and are subject to numerous laws and governmental regulations we could incur substantial judgments fines legal fees and other costs We are sometimes the subject of complaints or litigation which may include class action litigation from customers Team Members or others for various actions From time to time we are involved in litigation involving claims related to among other things breach of contract tortious conduct employment labor discrimination breach of laws or regulations including The Americans With Disabilities Act payment of wages exposure to asbestos or potentially hazardous product real estate and product defects The damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings are substantial Although we maintain liability insurance for some litigation claims if one or more of the claims were to greatly exceed our insurance coverage limits or if our insurance policies do not cover a claim this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows For instance we are currently subject to a putative securities class action regarding past public disclosures see Item 3 Legal Proceedings of this annual report and to several lawsuits alleging injury as a result of exposure to asbestoscontaining products see Note 14 Contingencies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein We are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to among other things environmental protection product quality and safety standards building and zoning requirements labor and employment discrimination and income taxes Compliance with existing and future laws and regulations could increase the cost of doing business and adversely affect our results of operations If we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions while incurring substantial legal fees and costs as well as reputational risk In addition our capital and operating expenses could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any existing or future laws or regulations We work diligently to maintain the privacy and security of our customer supplier Team Member and business information and the functioning of our computer systems website and other online offerings In the event of a security breach or other cyber security incident we could experience adverse operational effects or interruptions andor become subject to legal or regulatory proceedings any of which could lead to damage to our reputation in the marketplace and substantial costs The nature of our business requires us to receive retain and transmit certain personally identifiable information about our customers suppliers and Team Members some of which is entrusted to thirdparty service providers While we have taken and continue to undertake significant steps to protect such personally identifiable information and other confidential information and to protect the functioning of our computer systems website and other online offerings a compromise of our data security systems or those of businesses we interact with could result in information related to our customers suppliers Team Members or business being obtained by unauthorized persons or adverse operational effects or interruptions which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows We develop maintain and update processes and systems in an effort to try to prevent this from occurring but these actions are costly and require constant ongoing attention as technologies change privacy and information security regulations change and efforts to overcome security measures by bad actors continue to become ever more sophisticated Despite our efforts our security measures may be breached in the future
