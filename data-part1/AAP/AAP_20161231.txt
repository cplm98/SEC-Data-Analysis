the same general market area or substantial renovations of stores 3 The number of store closures in 2016 2015 2014 and 2013 includes planned consolidations of 159 111 145 and 20 respectively Carquest AI and BWP stores Store Technology Our stores utilize operating systems comprised of an integrated POS system and EPC which enable our store Team Members to assist our customers in their parts selection and ordering based on the year make model and engine type of their vehicles Historically we have operated separate legacy store systems for Advance Auto Parts and Carquest stores Under our strategic business plan we have begun the rollout of a single POS and EPC that leverages the benefits of each system Team Members can check the quantity of onhand inventory for any SKU adjust stock levels for select items for store specific events automatically process returns and defective merchandise designate SKUs for cycle counts and track merchandise transfers If a hardtofind part or accessory is not available the store system can determine whether the part is carried and instock through our supply chain network or can be ordered directly from one of our vendors Parts and accessories are then ordered electronically with immediate confirmation of price availability and estimated delivery time The Worldpac speedDIAL  parts catalog and fulfillment ordering system provides

centers in Roanoke VA and Raleigh NC We also maintain a store support center in Newark CA to support our Worldpac and ecommerce operations and in Norton MA to support our Autopart International stores Merchandising In 2016  we purchased merchandise from over 500 vendors with no single vendor accounting for more than 8 of purchases Our purchasing strategy involves negotiating agreements with most of our vendors to purchase merchandise over a specified period of time along with other terms including pricing payment terms and volume Our merchandising teams have developed strong vendor relationships in the industry and in a collaborative effort with our vendor partners utilize a category management process where we manage the mix of our product offerings to meet customer demand We believe this process which develops a customerfocused business plan for each merchandise category and our global sourcing operation are critical to improving comparable store sales gross margin and inventory productivity Our merchandising strategy is to carry a broad selection of high quality and reputable brand name automotive parts and accessories which we believe will appeal to our Professional customers and also generate DIY customer traffic Since our acquisition of GPI we have rolled out crosssourcing capabilities to the majority of our stores and have substantially completed the integration of our product offerings in our Advance Auto Parts and Carquest stores Some of our brands include Bosch   Castrol   Dayco   Denso   Gates   Moog   Monroe   NGK   Prestone   Purolator   Trico  and Wagner   In addition to these branded products we stock a wide selection of high quality private label products that appeal to valueconscious customers 6 Table of Contents These lines of merchandise include chemicals interior automotive accessories batteries and parts under various private label names such as Autocraft   Autopart International   Driveworks   Tough One  and Wearever  as well as the Carquest  brand acquired from GPI Supply Chain Our supply chain consists of a network of distribution centers HUBs stores and branches which enable us to provide sameday or nextday availability to our customers As of December 31 2016  we operated 50 distribution centers ranging in size from approximately 55000 to 665000 square feet with total square footage of approximately 108 million  Currently our smaller distribution centers primarily service our Carquest stores acquired with GPI including those that have converted to the Advance Auto Parts format while our larger distribution centers primarily service Advance Auto Parts Autopart International and Worldpac locations In 2016 we closed one distribution center in Sutton MA and opened one new Worldpac distribution center in the greater Dallas TX area We also plan to open a new distribution center in the greater Nashville TN area in 2017 We tailor the delivery frequency from our distributions centers to our stores and branches to the demands of our local markets We also utilize HUBs and other inmarket strategies to increase inmarket parts availability and decrease ordertodelivery time while at the same time reducing inventory and days on hand In addition we utilize crosssourcing of inventory between most of our enterprisewide locations to expand availability and the breadth of our product offerings to better meet the needs of our customers Our inventory management teams utilize replenishment systems to monitor inventory levels across the network and order additional product when appropriate while streamlining handling costs Our replenishment systems utilize the most uptodate information from our POS systems as well as inventory movement forecasting based upon sales history sales trends by SKU seasonality and weather patterns and demographic shifts in demand These factors are combined with service level goals vendor lead times and cost of inventory assumptions to determine the timing and size of purchase orders Our strategic initiatives include streamlining our entire supply chain infrastructure to build new capabilities to improve availability delivery consistency and speed and drive growth while removing unnecessary costs We plan to begin simplifying and fully integrating our Advance Auto Parts and Carquest networks by 2018 which will include the implementation of a single information technology system This optimization will improve product availability drive productivity through reducing the number of miles from the distribution center to the store and simplify our systems and processes by enabling seamless inventory transfer throughout the chain Marketing  Advertising Our marketing and advertising program is designed to drive brand awareness consideration and

supports our Professional customers with i online marketing solutions ii fully searchable diagnostic and repair service resources iii online shop tech training and iv a shop management system 7 Table of Contents Seasonality Our business is somewhat seasonal in nature with the highest sales usually occurring in the spring and summer months In addition our business can be affected by weather conditions While unusually heavy precipitation tends to soften sales as elective maintenance is deferred during such periods extremely hot or cold weather tends to enhance sales by causing automotive parts to fail at an accelerated rate Our fourth quarter is generally our most volatile as weather and spending tradeoffs typically influence our Professional and DIY sales Team Members As of February 23 2017  we employed approximately 41000 fulltime Team Members and approximately 33000 parttime Team Members Our workforce consisted of 87 of our Team Members employed in storelevel operations 9 employed in distribution and 4 employed in our corporate offices As of February 23 2017  less than 1 of our Team Members were represented by labor unions We have never experienced any labor disruption We believe that our Team Member relations are solid Intellectual Property We own a number of trade names and own and have federally registered several service marks and trademarks including Advance Auto Parts Autopart International Carquest CARQUEST Technical Institute DriverSide MotoLogic MotoShop Worldpac speedDIAL and TECHNET Professional Auto Service for use in connection with the automotive parts business In addition we own and have registered a number of trademarks for our private label brands We believe that these trade names service marks and trademarks are important to our merchandising strategy We do not know of any infringing uses that would materially affect the use of these trade names and marks and we actively defend and enforce them Competition We operate in both the Professional and DIY markets of the automotive aftermarket industry Our primary competitors are i both national and regional chains of automotive parts stores including AutoZone Inc NAPA OReilly Automotive Inc The Pep BoysManny Moe  Jack and Auto Plus formerly UniSelect USA Inc ii discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry automotive products iii wholesalers or jobber stores including those associated with national parts distributors or associations iv independentlyowned stores v automobile dealers that supply parts and vi internetbased retailers We believe that chains of automotive parts stores that like us have multiple locations in one or more markets have competitive advantages in customer service marketing inventory selection purchasing and distribution as compared to independent retailers and jobbers that are not part of a chain or associated with other retailers or jobbers The principal methods of competition in our business include customer service product offerings availability quality price and store location Environmental Matters We are subject to various federal state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to the operation of our business including those governing collection transportation and recycling of automotive leadacid batteries used automotive oil and other recyclable items and ownership and operation of real property We sell products containing hazardous materials as part of our business In addition our customers may bring automotive leadacid batteries used automotive oil or other recyclable items onto our properties We currently provide collection and recycling programs for used leadacid batteries used oil and other recyclable items at a majority of our stores as a service to our customers Pursuant to agreements with third party vendors leadacid batteries used oil and other recyclable items are collected by our Team Members deposited onto pallets or into vendor supplied containers and stored by us until collected by the third party vendors for recycling or proper disposal The terms of our contracts with third party vendors require that they are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations Our third party vendors who arrange for the removal disposal treatment or other handling of hazardous or toxic substances may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation at any affected disposal treatment or other site affected by such substances Based on our experience we do not believe that there are any material environmental costs associated with the current business practice of accepting leadacid batteries used oil and other recyclable items as these costs are borne by the respective third party vendors We own and lease real property Under various environmental laws and regulations a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on under or in such property These laws often impose joint and several liability and may be imposed without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the release of such hazardous or toxic substances Other environmental laws and 8 Table of Contents common law principles also could be used to impose liability for releases of hazardous materials into the environment or work place and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury or property damage associated with exposure to released hazardous substances From time to time we receive notices from the Environmental Protection Agency and state environmental authorities indicating that there may be contamination on properties we own lease or operate or may have owned leased or operated in the past or on adjacent properties for which we may be responsible Compliance with these laws and regulations and clean up of released hazardous substances have not had a material impact on our operations to date Item 1A Risk Factors Our business is subject to a variety of risks Our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted by the following risk factors These risks are not the only risks that may impact our business If overall demand for the products we sell slows or declines our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows will suffer Decreased demand could also negatively impact our stock price Overall demand for products sold by our stores depends on many factors and may slow or decrease due to any number of reasons including  a decrease in the number of vehicles or in the number of annual miles driven  because fewer vehicles means less maintenance and repairs and lower vehicle mileage which may be affected by gas prices and other factors decreases the need for maintenance and repair while higher miles driven increases the need  the economy  because during periods of declining economic conditions consumers may defer vehicle maintenance or repair and discretionary spending conversely during periods of favorable economic conditions more of our DIY customers may pay others to repair and maintain their cars or they may purchase new cars  the weather because milder weather conditions may lower the failure rates of automobile parts while extended periods of rain and winter precipitation may cause our customers to defer elective maintenance and repair of their vehicles  the average duration of manufacturer warranties and average age of vehicles being driven because newer cars typically require fewer repairs and will be repaired by the manufacturers dealer network using dealer parts pursuant to warranties which have gradually increased in duration andor mileage expiration over the recent past while vehicles that are seven years old and older are generally no longer covered under manufacturers warranties and tend to need more maintenance and repair than newer vehicles  technological advances and the increase in quality of vehicles manufactured  because vehicles that need less frequent maintenance and have low part failure rates will require less frequent repairs using aftermarket parts and  the refusal of vehicle manufacturers to make available diagnostic repair and maintenance information to the automotive aftermarket industry that our Professional and DIY customers require to diagnose repair and maintain their vehicles  because this may force consumers to have a majority of diagnostic work repairs and maintenance performed by the vehicle manufacturers dealer network If we are unable to compete successfully against other companies in the automotive aftermarket industry we may lose customers our revenues may decline and we may be less profitable or potentially unprofitable The sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive in many ways including name recognition location price quality product availability and customer service We compete in both the Professional and DIY categories of the automotive aftermarket industry primarily with i national and regional chains of automotive parts stores ii discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry automotive products iii wholesalers or jobbers stores including those associated with national parts distributors or associations iv independentlyowned stores v automobile dealers that supply parts and vi internetbased retailers These competitors and the level of competition vary by market Some of our competitors may possess advantages over us in certain markets we share including with respect to the level of marketing activities number of stores store locations store layouts operating histories name recognition established customer bases vendor relationships prices and product warranties Consolidation among our competitors could enhance their market share and financial position provide them with the ability to achieve better purchasing terms and allow them to provide more competitive prices to customers for whom we compete In addition our reputation is critical to our continued success If we fail to maintain high standards for or receive negative publicity whether through social media or normal media channels relating to product safety quality or integrity we could lose customers to our competition The product we sell is branded both in brands of our vendors and in our own private label brands If the perceived quality or value of the brands we sell declines in the eyes of our customers our results of operations could be negatively affected 9 Table of Contents These potential competitive disadvantages may require us to reduce our prices below our normal selling prices or increase our promotional spending which would lower our revenue and profitability Competitive disadvantages may also prevent us from introducing new product lines require us to discontinue current product offerings or change some of our current operating strategies If we do not have the resources expertise consistent execution or otherwise fail to develop successful strategies to address these competitive disadvantages we may lose customers our revenues and profit margins may decline and we may be less profitable or potentially unprofitable If we are unable to successfully implement our business strategy including increasing sales to Professional and DIY customers expanding our margins and increasing our return on invested capital our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity could be adversely affected We have identified numerous initiatives as part of our business strategy to increase sales to both Professional and DIY customers and expand our margins in order to increase our earnings and cash flows If we are unable to implement these initiatives efficiently and effectively or if these initiatives are unsuccessful our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity could be adversely affected Successful implementation of our business strategy also depends on factors specific to the automotive aftermarket industry and numerous other factors that may be beyond our control For that portion of our inventory manufactured andor sourced outside the United States geopolitical changes changes in trade regulations currency fluctuations shipping related issues natural disasters pandemics and other factors beyond our control may increase the cost of items we purchase or create shortages which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability In addition adverse changes in our ability to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and to meet customers needs for automotive products particularly parts availability in a timely manner could undermine our business strategy and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows If we are unable to successfully implement our growth strategy through new store openings targeted acquisitions and the continued increase in supply chain capacity and efficiency we will not be able to expand our business which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows Store Growth We intend to continue to increase the number of our stores and expand the markets we serve as part of our growth strategy primarily by opening new stores We may also grow our business through strategic acquisitions We do not know whether the implementation of our growth strategy will be successful As we open and operate more stores it becomes more critical that we have consistent execution across our entire store chain We are unsure whether we will be able to open and operate new stores on a timely or sufficiently profitable basis or that opening new stores in markets we already serve will not harm existing store profitability or comparable store sales The newly opened and existing stores profitability will depend on the competition we face as well as our ability to properly merchandise market and price the products desired by customers in these markets The actual number of new stores to be opened and their success will depend on a number of factors including among other things  the availability of desirable store locations  the negotiation of acceptable lease or purchase terms for new locations  the availability of financial resources including access to capital at costeffective interest rates and  our ability to manage the expansion and to hire train and retain qualified Team Members We also expect to continue to make strategic acquisitions as an element of our growth strategy Acquisitions including our 2014 acquisition of GPI involve certain risks that could cause our growth and profitability to differ from our expectations The success of our acquisitions depend on a number of factors including among other things  Our ability to continue to identify suitable acquisition targets or to acquire additional companies at favorable prices or on other favorable terms  The risk that managements attention may be distracted  Our ability to retain key personnel from acquired businesses  Our ability to successfully integrate the operations and systems of the acquired companies and achieve the strategic operational financial or other anticipated benefits of the acquisition  We may incur significant transaction and integration costs in connection with acquisitions that may not be offset by the benefits achieved from the acquisition in the near term or at all  We may assume or become subject to loss contingencies known or unknown of the acquired companies which could related to past present or future facts events circumstances or occurrences 10 Table of Contents Supply Chain Our store inventories are primarily replenished by shipments from our network of distribution centers warehouses and HUB stores As we service our growing store base we will need to increase the efficiency and capacity of our supply chain network in order to achieve the business goal of reducing inventory costs while improving availability and movement of goods throughout our supply chain to meet consumer product needs and channel preferences We continue to streamline and optimize our supply chain network and systems as we integrate GPI and cannot be assured of our ability to increase the productivity and efficiency of our overall supply chain network to desired levels If we fail to effectively utilize our existing supply chain or if our investments in our supply chain do not provide the anticipated benefits we could experience suboptimal inventory levels in our locations or increase in our costs which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows We are dependent on our suppliers to supply us with products that comply with safety and quality standards at competitive prices We are dependent on our vendors continuing to supply us quality products on terms that are favorable to us If our merchandise offerings do not meet our customers expectations regarding safety and quality we could experience lost sales increased costs and exposure to legal and reputational risk All of our suppliers must comply with applicable product safety laws and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety and quality standards Events that give rise to actual potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to government enforcement action andor private litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities To the extent our suppliers are subject to additional government regulation of their product design andor manufacturing processes the cost of the merchandise we purchase may rise In addition negative customer perceptions regarding the safety or quality of the products we sell could cause our customers to seek alternative sources for their needs resulting in lost sales In those circumstances it may be difficult and costly for us to regain the confidence of our customers We depend on the services of many qualified executives and other Team Members whom we may not be able to attract develop and retain Our success depends to a significant extent on the continued services and experience of our executives and other Team Members As of February 23 2017  we employed approximately 74000 Team Members We may not be able to retain our current executives and other key Team Members or attract and retain additional qualified executives and Team Members who may be needed in the future We must also continue to motivate employees and keep them focused on our strategies and goals Our ability to maintain an adequate number of executive and other qualified Team Members is highly dependent on an attractive and competitive compensation and benefits package In addition less than one percent of our team members are represented by unions If these team members were to engage in a strike work stoppage or other slowdown or if the terms and conditions in labor agreements were renegotiated we could experience a disruption in our operations and higher ongoing labor costs If we fail or are unable to maintain competitive compensation our customer service and execution levels could suffer by reason of a declining quality of our workforce which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows The market price of our common stock may be volatile and could expose us to securities class action litigation The stock market and the price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations based upon general economic and market conditions Downturns in the stock market may cause the price of our common stock to decline The market price of our stock may also be affected by our ability to meet analysts expectations Failure to meet such expectations even slightly could have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock In the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a companys securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such a company If similar litigation were instituted against us it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our managements attention and resources which could have an adverse effect on our business Our level of indebtedness could limit the cash flow available for operations and could adversely affect our ability to service our debt or obtain additional financing and a downgrade in our credit ratings or deterioration in global credit markets or general macroeconomic conditions including unemployment inflation or deflation consumer debt levels high fuel and energy costs and higher tax rates could have a negative impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 11 Table of Contents Level of Indebtedness Our level of indebtedness could restrict our operations and make it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations For example our level of indebtedness could among other things  affect our liquidity by limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital limit our ability to obtain financing for capital expenditures and acquisitions or make any available financing more costly  require us to dedicate all or a substantial portion of our cash flow to service our debt which would reduce funds available for other business purposes such as capital expenditures dividends or acquisitions  limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in the markets in which we compete  place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors who may have less indebtedness  render us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions and  make it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations In addition the indenture governing our notes and credit agreement governing our credit facilities contain financial and other restrictive covenants Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of all of our debt including such notes Impact of Changes in Credit Ratings and Credit Market Uncertainty Our overall credit rating may be negatively impacted by deteriorating and uncertain credit markets or other factors which may or may not be within our control The interest rates on our publicly issued debt and revolving credit facility are linked directly to our credit ratings Accordingly any negative impact on our credit rating would likely result in higher interest rates and interest expense on any borrowings under our revolving credit facility or future issuances of public debt and less favorable terms on other operating and financing arrangements In addition it could reduce the attractiveness of our vendor payment programs where certain of our vendors finance payment obligations from us with designated third party financial institutions which could result in increased working capital requirements Conditions and events in the global credit market could have a material adverse effect on our access to short and longterm borrowings to finance our operations and the terms and cost of that debt It is possible that one or more of the banks that provide us with financing under our revolving credit facility may fail to honor the terms of our existing credit facility or be financially unable to provide the unused credit as a result of significant deterioration in its financial condition An inability to obtain sufficient financing at costeffective rates could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows Impact on our Suppliers Our business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our suppliers and on our suppliers ability and willingness to sell quality products to us at favorable prices and terms Many factors outside our control may harm these relationships and the ability or willingness of these suppliers to sell us products on favorable terms Such factors include a general decline in the economy and economic conditions and prolonged recessionary conditions These events could negatively affect our suppliers operations and make it difficult for them to obtain the credit lines or loans necessary to finance their operations in the shortterm or longterm and meet our product requirements Financial or operational difficulties that some of our suppliers may face could also increase the cost of the products we purchase from them or our ability to source product from them We might not be able to pass our increased costs onto our customers If our suppliers fail to develop new products we may not be able to meet the demands of our customers and our results of operations could be negatively affected In addition the trend towards consolidation among automotive parts suppliers as well as the offshoring of manufacturing capacity to foreign countries may disrupt or end our relationship with some suppliers and could lead to less competition and result in higher prices We could also be negatively impacted by suppliers who might experience bankruptcies work stoppages labor strikes or other interruptions to or difficulties in the manufacture or supply of the products we purchase from them Impact on our Customers Deterioration in macroeconomic conditions may have a negative impact on our customers net worth financial resources and disposable income This impact could reduce our customers willingness or ability to pay for accessories maintenance or repair of their vehicles which results in lower sales in our stores An increase in fuel costs may also reduce the overall number of miles driven by our customers resulting in fewer parts failures and a reduced need for elective maintenance 12 Table of Contents Impact on Operating Costs Rising energy prices could directly impact our operating and product costs including our merchandise distribution Professional delivery utility and product acquisition costs Because we are involved in litigation from time to time and are subject to numerous laws and governmental regulations we could incur substantial judgments fines legal fees and other costs We are sometimes the subject of complaints or litigation which may include class action litigation from customers Team Members or others for various actions From time to time we are involved in litigation involving claims related to among other things breach of contract tortious conduct employment labor discrimination breach of laws or regulations including The Americans With Disabilities Act payment of wages asbestos exposure real estate regulatory compliance and product defects The damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings are substantial Although we maintain liability insurance for some litigation claims if one or more of the claims were to greatly exceed our insurance coverage limits or if our insurance policies do not cover a claim this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows We are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to among other things environmental protection product quality standards building and zoning requirements discrimination labor and employment and income taxes The implementation of and compliance with existing and future laws and regulations could increase the cost of doing business and adversely affect our results of operations If we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions while incurring substantial legal fees and costs In addition our capital and operating expenses could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any existing or future laws or regulations We work diligently to maintain the privacy and security of our customer supplier Team Member and business information and the functioning of our computer systems website and other online offerings In the event of a security breach or other cyber security incident we could experience adverse operational effects or interruptions incur substantial additional costs or become subject to legal or regulatory proceedings any of which could lead to damage to our reputation in the marketplace and added costs on an ongoing basis The nature of our business requires us to receive retain and transmit certain personally identifiable information about our customers suppliers and Team Members some of which is entrusted to thirdparty service providers While we have taken and continue to undertake significant steps to protect such personally identifiable information and other confidential information and to protect the functioning of our computer systems website and other online offerings a compromise of our data security systems or those of businesses we interact with could result in information related to our customers suppliers Team Members or business being obtained by unauthorized persons or adverse operational effects or interruptions which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows We develop and update processes and maintain systems in an effort to try to prevent this from occurring but the development and maintenance of these processes and systems are costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change privacy and information security regulations change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated Consequently despite our efforts our security measures have been breached in an immaterial manner in the past and may be breached in the future due to a cyberattack computer malware andor viruses team member error malfeasance fraudulent inducement including socalled social engineering attacks and phishing scams or other acts Unauthorized parties have in the past obtained and may in the future obtain access to our data or the data of our customers suppliers or Team Members or may otherwise cause damage to or interfere with our equipment andor network While costs associated with past security breaches have not been significant any breach damage to or interference with our equipment or network or unauthorized access in the future could result in significant legal and financial exposure and damage to our reputation that could potentially have an adverse effect on our business While we also seek to obtain assurances that others we interact with will protect confidential information there is always the risk that the confidentiality or accessibility of data held or utilized by others may be compromised If a compromise of our data security or function of our computer systems or website were to occur it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition and possibly subject us to additional legal regulatory and operating costs and damage our reputation in the marketplace Business interruptions may negatively impact our store hours operability of our computer systems and the availability and cost of merchandise which may adversely impact our sales and profitability 13 Table of Contents Hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes or other natural disasters war or acts of terrorism or the threat of any of these calamities or others may have a negative impact on our ability to obtain merchandise to sell in our stores result in certain of our stores being closed for an extended period of time negatively affect the lives of our customers or Team Members or otherwise negatively impact our operations Some of our merchandise is imported from other countries If imported goods become difficult or impossible to import into the United States due to business interruption including regulation of exporting or importing and if we cannot obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar costs and without an adverse delay our sales and profit margins may be negatively affected In the event that commercial transportation including the global shipping industry is curtailed or substantially delayed our business may be adversely impacted as we may have difficulty receiving merchandise from our suppliers and shipping it to our stores Terrorist attacks war in the Middle East or insurrection involving any oil producing country could result in an abrupt increase in the price of crude oil gasoline and diesel fuel Such price increases would increase the cost of doing business for us and our suppliers and also would negatively impact our customers disposable income and have an adverse impact on our business sales profit margins and results of operations We rely extensively on our computer systems and the systems of our business partners to manage inventory process transactions and report results These systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages telecommunication failures computer viruses security breaches and catastrophic events If our computer systems or those of our business partners fail we may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to process transactions and manage inventory Any such loss if widespread or extended could adversely affect the operation of our business and our results of operations We may be affected by global climate change or by legal regulatory or market responses to such change The concern over climate change has led to legislative and regulatory initiatives aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions GHG For example proposals that would impose mandatory requirements related to GHG continue to be considered by policy makers in the United States and elsewhere Laws enacted to reduce GHG that directly or indirectly affect our suppliers through an increase in their cost of production or our business through an impact on our inventory availability cost of sales operations or demand for the products we sell could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows New federal or state restrictions on emissions that may be imposed on vehicles could also adversely affect annual miles driven or the demand for the products we sell and lead to changes in automotive technology Changes in automotive technology and compliance with any new or more stringent laws or regulations or stricter interpretations of existing laws could require additional expenditures by us or our suppliers all of which could adversely impact the demand for our products and our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows Item 1B Unresolved Staff Comments None Item 2 Properties The following table summarizes the location ownership status and total square footage of space

provinces 6484 4273 Store Support Centers Roanoke Virginia Roanoke Virginia 270  Raleigh North Carolina Raleigh North Carolina 146  As of December 31 2016  we owned 816 of our stores and leased 4373 stores and branches We also operate several smaller warehouse locations and subsidiary offices to support our operations 14 Table of Contents Item 3 Legal Proceedings We currently and from time to time are involved in litigation and regulatory proceedings incidental to the conduct of our business including litigation relating to employment or arising from claims of discrimination as a result of claims by current and former Team Members or others Although we diligently defend against these claims we may enter into discussions regarding settlement of these and other lawsuits and may enter into settlement agreements if we believe settlement is in the best interests of the Company and our shareholders The damages claimed against us in some of these proceedings are substantial Although the amount of liability that may result from these matters cannot be ascertained we do not currently believe that in the aggregate they will result in liabilities material to our consolidated financial condition future results of operations or cash flow Our Western Auto subsidiary together with other defendants including but not limited to automobile manufacturers automotive parts manufacturers and their material suppliers and other retailers has been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging injury as a result of exposure to asbestoscontaining products We and some of our other subsidiaries also have been named as a defendant in many of these lawsuits The automotive products at issue in these lawsuits are primarily brake parts The plaintiffs have alleged that these products contained asbestos and were manufactured distributed andor sold by the various defendants Many of the pending cases against us and our subsidiaries are in early stages of litigation The damages claimed against the defendants in some of these proceedings are substantial Additionally many of the suppliers and manufacturers of asbestos and asbestoscontaining products have dissolved or declared bankruptcy which will limit plaintiffs ability to recover monetary damages from those entities Although we diligently defend against these claims we may enter into discussions regarding settlement of these and other lawsuits and may enter into settlement agreements if we believe settlement is in the best interests of the Company and our shareholders We also believe that many of these claims are at least partially covered by insurance Based on discovery to date we do not believe the cases currently pending will have a material adverse effect on us However if we were to incur an adverse verdict in one or more of these claims and were ordered to pay substantial damages that were not covered by insurance these claims could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial position and cash flows Historically our asbestos claims have been inconsistent in fact patterns alleged and number and have been immaterial Furthermore the outcome of such legal matters is uncertain and our liability if any could vary widely As a result we are unable to estimate a possible range of loss with respect to unasserted asbestos claims that may be filed against the Company or its subsidiaries in the future If the number of claims filed against us or any of our subsidiaries alleging injury as a result of exposure to asbestoscontaining products increases substantially the costs associated with concluding these claims including damages resulting from any adverse verdicts could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial position and cash flows in future periods Item 4 Mine Safety
