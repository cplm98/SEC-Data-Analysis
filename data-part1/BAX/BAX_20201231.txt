PART I Item 1 Business Company Overview Baxter International Inc through its subsidiaries provides a broad portfolio of essential healthcare products including acute and chronic dialysis therapies sterile intravenous IV solutions infusion systems and devices parenteral nutrition therapies inhaled anesthetics generic injectable pharmaceuticals and surgical hemostat and sealant products These products are used by hospitals kidney dialysis centers nursing homes rehabilitation centers doctors offices and by patients at home under physician supervision Our global footprint and the critical nature of our products and services play a key role in expanding access to healthcare in emerging and developed countries As of December 31 2020 we manufactured products in over 20 countries and sold them in over 100 countries Baxter International Inc was incorporated under Delaware law in 1931 As used in this report Baxter International means Baxter International Inc and we our or us means Baxter International and its consolidated subsidiaries after giving effect to the separation and distribution of Baxalta Incorporated Baxalta in 2015 as further described below unless the context otherwise requires COVID19 Our global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises and epidemicspandemics such as the novel strain of coronavirus COVID19 COVID19 has had and we expect will continue to have an adverse impact on our operations supply chains and distribution systems and has increased and we expect will continue to increase our expenses including as a result of impacts associated with preventive and precautionary measures that we other businesses and governments are taking These measures have led to unprecedented restrictions on disruptions in and other related impacts on businesses and personal activities In addition to travel restrictions put in place in early 2020 governments have closed borders imposed prolonged quarantines and may continue those measures or implement other restrictions and requirements in light of the continuing spread of the pandemic We expect that these evolving restrictions and requirements as well as the corresponding need to adapt to new methods of conducting business remotely will continue to have an adverse effect on our business For further discussion refer to Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10K Business Segments and Products We manage our business based on three geographic segments Americas North and South America EMEA Europe Middle East and Africa and APAC AsiaPacific Each of our segments provides a broad portfolio of essential healthcare products including acute and chronic dialysis therapies sterile IV solutions infusion systems and devices parenteral nutrition therapies inhaled anesthetics generic injectable pharmaceuticals and surgical hemostat and sealant products For financial information about our segments see Note 16 in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10K Sales and Distribution We have our own direct sales force and also make sales to and through independent distributors drug wholesalers acting as sales agents and specialty pharmacy or other alternate site providers In the United States third parties such as Cardinal Health Inc warehouse and ship a significant portion of our products through their distribution centers These centers are generally stocked with adequate inventories to facilitate prompt customer service Sales and distribution methods include frequent contact by sales and customer service representatives automated communications via various electronic purchasing systems circulation of catalogs and merchandising bulletins directmail campaigns trade publication presence and advertising Sales are made and products are distributed on a direct basis or through independent distributors or sales agents in more than 100 countries as of December 31 2020 1 International Operations The majority of our revenues are generated outside of the United States and geographic expansion remains a component of our strategy Our presence includes operations in Europe the Middle East Africa AsiaPacific Latin America and Canada We are subject to certain risks inherent in conducting business outside the United States For more information on these risks see the information under the captions Risks Related to Baxters Business We are subject to risks associated with doing business globally and Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and liquidity in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10K For financial information about our foreign and domestic revenues and geographic segment information see Note 16 in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10K For more information regarding foreign currency exchange risk refer to the discussion under the caption entitled Financial Instrument Market Risk in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10K Contractual Arrangements Our products are sold through contracts with customers both within and outside the United States Some of these contracts have terms of more than one year and place limits on our ability to increase prices In the case of hospitals governments and other facilities these contracts may specify minimum quantities of a particular product or categories of products to be purchased by the customer In keeping with the increased emphasis on costeffectiveness in healthcare delivery many hospitals and other customers of medical products in the United States have joined group purchasing organizations GPOs or formed integrated delivery networks IDNs to enhance purchasing power GPOs and IDNs negotiate pricing arrangements with manufacturers and distributors and the negotiated prices are made available to members We have purchasing agreements with several of the major GPOs in the United States GPOs may have agreements with more than one supplier for certain products Accordingly in these cases we face competition from other suppliers even where a customer is a member of a GPO under contract with us Purchasing power is similarly consolidated in many other countries For example public contracting authorities act as the purchasing entities for the hospitals and other customers of medical products in their region and many hospitals and other customers have joined joint procurement entities and buying consortia The result is that demand for healthcare products is increasingly concentrated across our markets globally Raw Materials Raw materials essential to our business are purchased from numerous suppliers worldwide in the ordinary course of business Although most of these materials are generally available we at times may experience shortages of supply In an effort to manage risk associated with raw materials supply we work closely with our suppliers to help ensure availability and continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability We also seek to develop new and alternative sources of supply where beneficial to our overall raw materials procurement strategy We are not always able to recover cost increases for raw materials through customer pricing due to contractual limits and market forces Accordingly we utilize longterm supply contracts with some suppliers to help maintain continuity of supply and manage the risk of price increases In connection with the separation and distribution of Baxalta in 2015 as further described below we entered into a longterm manufacturing and supply agreement with Baxalta Baxalta manufactures and supplies us with ARTISS TISSEEL FLOSEAL and standalone thrombin on a costplus basis under that manufacturing and supply agreement Competition and Healthcare Cost Containment Our businesses benefit from a number of competitive advantages including the breadth and depth of our product offerings and our strong relationships with customers including hospitals and clinics GPOs physicians and patients many of whom selfadminister homebased therapies that we supply We also benefit from efficiencies and cost advantages resulting from shared manufacturing facilities and the technological advantages of our products 2 Although no single company competes with us in all of our businesses we face substantial competition in each of our segments from international and domestic healthcare and pharmaceutical companies and providers of all sizes and these competitors often differ across our businesses In addition global and regional competitors continue to expand their manufacturing capacity and sales and marketing channels Competition is primarily focused on costeffectiveness price service product performance and technological innovation There has been increasing consolidation in our customer base and by our competitors which continues to result in pricing and market pressures Global efforts toward healthcare cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing Governments around the world use various mechanisms to control healthcare expenditures such as price controls the formation of public contracting authorities product formularies lists of recommended or approved products and competitive tenders which require the submission of a bid to sell products Sales of our products are dependent in part on the availability of reimbursement by government agencies and healthcare programs as well as insurance companies and other private payers In the United States the federal and many state governments have adopted or proposed initiatives relating to Medicaid and other health programs that may limit reimbursement or increase rebates that we and other providers are required to pay to the state In addition to government regulation managed care organizations in the United States which include medical insurance companies medical plan administrators healthmaintenance organizations hospital and physician alliances and pharmacy benefit managers continue to put pressure on the price and usage of healthcare products Managed care organizations seek to contain healthcare expenditures and their purchasing strength has been increasing due to their consolidation into fewer larger organizations and a growing number of enrolled patients We face similar issues outside of the United States In Europe and Latin America for example the government provides healthcare at low cost to patients and controls its expenditures by purchasing products through public tenders collective purchasing regulating prices setting reference prices in public tenders or limiting reimbursement or patient access to certain products Intellectual Property Patents and other proprietary rights are essential to our business We rely on patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets knowhow and confidentiality agreements to develop maintain and strengthen our competitive position We own a number of patents and trademarks throughout the world and have entered into license arrangements relating to various thirdparty patents and technologies Products manufactured by us are sold primarily under our own trademarks and trade names Some products distributed by us are sold under our trade names while others are sold under trade names owned by our suppliers or partners Trade secret protection of unpatented confidential and proprietary information is also important to us We maintain certain details about our processes products and technology as trade secrets and generally require employees consultants and business partners to enter into confidentiality agreements These agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach In addition our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors To the extent that our employees consultants and business partners use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting knowhow and inventions Our policy is to protect our products and technology through patents and trademarks on a worldwide basis This protection is sought in a manner that balances the cost of such protection against obtaining the greatest value for us We also recognize the need to promote the enforcement of our patents and trademarks and take commercially reasonable steps to enforce our patents and trademarks around the world against potential infringers including judicial or administrative action where appropriate We operate in an industry susceptible to significant patent litigation At any given time we are involved as either a plaintiff or defendant in a number of patent infringement and other intellectual propertyrelated actions Such litigation can result in significant royalty or other payments or result in injunctions that can prevent the sale of products For more information on patent and other litigation see Note 7 in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10K Research and Development Our investment in research and development RD consistent with our portfolio optimization and capital allocation strategies helps fuel our future growth and our ability to remain competitive in each of our product categories Accordingly we continue to focus our investment on select RD programs to enhance future growth through clinical differentiation Expenditures for our RD activities were 521 million in 2020 595 million in 2019 and 654 million in 2018 These expenditures include costs associated with RD activities performed at our RD centers located 3 around the world which include facilities in Belgium Sweden India Italy Germany China Japan and the United States as well as inlicensing milestone and reimbursement payments made to partners for RD work performed at nonBaxter locations For more information on our RD activities refer to the discussion under the caption entitled Strategic Objectives in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10K Quality Management Our continued success depends upon the quality of our products Quality management plays an essential role in determining and meeting customer requirements helping to prevent defects facilitating continuous improvement of our processes products and services and assuring the safety and efficacy of our products Our quality system enables the design development manufacturing packaging sterilization handling distribution and labeling of our products to ensure that they conform to customer requirements In order to consistently improve the effectiveness and efficiency of our quality system various measurement monitoring and analysis methods such as management reviews and internal external and vendor audits are employed at local and central levels Each product that we market is required to meet specific quality standards both in packaging and in product integrity and quality If any of those is determined to be compromised at any time we endeavor to take corrective and preventive actions designed to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and to meet customer expectations For more information on corrective actions taken by us refer to the discussion under the caption entitled Certain Regulatory Matters in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10K Government Regulation Our operations and many of the products manufactured or sold by us are subject to extensive regulation by numerous government agencies both within and outside the United States The Food and Drug Administration FDA in the United States the European Medicines Agency EMA in Europe the China Food and Drug Administration CFDA in China and other government agencies inside and outside of the United States administer requirements covering the testing safety effectiveness manufacturing labeling promotion and advertising distribution and postmarket surveillance of our products We must obtain specific approval from FDA and nonUS regulatory authorities before we can market and sell most of our products in a particular country Even after we obtain regulatory approval to market a product the product and our manufacturing processes and quality systems are subject to continued review by FDA and other regulatory authorities globally including additional 510k and other regulatory submissions and approvals or the time needed to secure approvals are not certain State agencies in the United States also regulate our facilities operations employees products and services within their respective states We along with our facilities are subject to periodic inspections and possible administrative and legal actions by FDA and other regulatory agencies inside and outside the United States Such actions may include warning letters product recalls or seizures monetary sanctions injunctions to halt the manufacture and distribution of products civil or criminal sanctions refusal of a government to grant approvals or licenses restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses As situations require we take steps to ensure safety and efficacy of our products such as removing products found not to meet applicable requirements from the market and improving the effectiveness of quality systems For more information on compliance actions taken by us refer to the discussion under the caption entitled Certain Regulatory Matters in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10K We are also subject to various laws inside and outside the United States concerning our relationships with healthcare professionals and government officials price reporting and regulation the promotion sales and marketing of our products and services the importation and exportation of products the operation of our facilities and distribution of products In the United States we are subject to the oversight of FDA Office of the Inspector General within the Department of Health and Human Services OIG the Center for MedicareMedicaid Services CMS the Department of Justice DOJ Environmental Protection Agency Department of Defense and Customs and Border Protection in addition to others We supply products and services to healthcare providers that are reimbursed by federally funded programs such as Medicare As a result our activities are subject to regulation by CMS and enforcement by OIG and DOJ In each jurisdiction outside the United States our activities are subject to regulation by government agencies including the EMA in Europe CFDA in China and other agencies in other jurisdictions Many of the agencies enforcing these laws have increased their enforcement activities with respect to healthcare companies in recent years These actions appear to be part of a general trend toward increased enforcement activity globally 4 Our operations involve the use of substances regulated under environmental laws primarily in manufacturing and sterilization processes Our environmental policies require compliance with all applicable environmental regulations and contemplate among other things appropriate capital expenditures for environmental protection For example we made 10 million of capital expenditures in 2020 related to a new ethylene oxide emissions control system at our Mountain Home Arkansas facility The new system is expected to be completed in 2022 and we currently expect to incur an additional 40 million of capital expenditures related to this project Separation of Baxalta On July 1 2015 we completed the distribution of approximately 805 of the outstanding common stock of Baxalta to our stockholders the Distribution The Distribution was made to our stockholders of record as of the close of business on June 17 2015 the Record Date who received one share of Baxalta common stock for each of our shares held as of the Record Date As a result of the distribution Baxalta became an independent public company In 2016 we disposed of our remaining 195 interest in Baxalta Retained Shares through a series of transactions including debtforequity exchanges an equityforequity exchange and a contribution to our US pension plan Retained Shares Transactions As a result of these transactions we extinguished approximately 365 billion of our indebtedness repurchased 11526638 of our shares and contributed 17145570 Baxalta shares to our US pension plan On June 3 2016 Baxalta became a whollyowned subsidiary of Shire plc Shire In January 2019 Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited Takeda acquired Shire As a result of the separation the consolidated statements of income consolidated balance sheets consolidated statements of cash flow and related financial information reflect Baxaltas operations assets and liabilities and cash flows as discontinued operations for all periods presented Human Capital Management As of December 31 2020 we employed approximately 50000 people globally with approximately 13000 employees in the United States and approximately 37000 employees outside of the Unites States Our employees are our most important assets and set the foundation for our ability to achieve our strategic objectives All of our employees contribute to our success and in particular the employees in our manufacturing sales RD and quality assurance departments are instrumental in driving operational execution and strong financial performance advancing innovation and maintaining a strong quality and compliance program The success and growth of our business depends in large part on our ability to attract retain and develop a diverse population of talented and highperforming employees at all levels of our organization including the individuals who comprise our global workforce as well as executive officers and other key personnel To succeed in a competitive labor market we have developed recruitment and retention strategies objectives and measures that we focus on as part of the overall management of our business These strategies objectives and measures form our human capital management framework and are advanced through the following programs policies and initiatives  Competitive Pay and Benefits Our compensation programs are designed to align the compensation of our employees with our performance and to provide the proper incentives to attract retain and motivate employees to achieve superior results The structure of our compensation programs balances incentive earnings for both shortterm and longterm performance  Activating Change Today ACT Building on our strong diversity and inclusion platform our senior leadership is working in close collaboration with the Baxter Black Alliance business resource group and colleagues from across the company on a multidimensional program to advance inclusion and racial justice The ACT initiative is focused on driving results across four key areas  Workforce Workplace Community and Marketplace  encompassing employees external stakeholders and the markets and communities we serve  Health and Safety Health and safety are firmly rooted across our global footprint In response to the COVID19 pandemic and related mitigation measures we implemented changes in our business in 2020 in an effort to better protect our employees and customers and to support appropriate health and safety protocols For example we installed physical barriers between employees in production facilities implemented extensive cleaning and sanitation processes for both production and office administration spaces and implemented broad workfromhome initiatives for employees in our administrative functions While our essential workers production and field service employees have continued to work at our facilities and provide vital service to our customers most employees in our administrative functions have effectively 5 worked remotely since midMarch During 2020 we paid incremental nonrecurring special compensation bonuses to our essential workers  Recruitment Training and Development We use recruitment vehicles to attract diverse talent to our organization and we invest in learning opportunities that foster a growth mindset Our formal offerings include a tuition reimbursement program an elearning platform known as BaxU and virtual workshops that support our culture strategy and the development of crucial skills To measure the impact of the investments we make in our people and to help us consistently improve our human resources programs we regularly conduct anonymous surveys of our global workforce to seek feedback on a variety of topics including confidence in our leadership competitiveness of our compensation and benefits packages career growth opportunities and improvements on how we can make our company an employer of choice Administered and analyzed by an independent thirdparty the survey results are reviewed by our senior leaders which include our executive officers The results of this engagement survey are also shared with individual managers who are then tasked with taking action based on their employees anonymous feedback both quantitative and qualitative By paying close attention to the results both at an aggregate enterprise level as well as at a departmentbusinesswork group level we have been able to enhance our culture of respect help educate employees more effectively about our benefits offerings as well as our learning and development opportunities and further improve our communications content mechanisms and frequency Available Information We make available free of charge on our website at wwwbaxtercom our Annual Reports on Form

10K Item 1A Risk Factors In addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10K stockholders or prospective investors should carefully consider the following risk factors If any of the events described below occurs our business financial condition results of operations future growth prospects and stock price could suffer Risks Related to the COVID19 Pandemic The effects of the COVID19 pandemic have had and we expect will continue to have a material adverse effect on our business The nature and extent of future impacts are uncertain and unpredictable Our global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises including epidemics and pandemics such as the COVID19 pandemic COVID19 has had and we expect will continue to have an adverse impact on our operations supply chains and distribution systems and has increased and will continue to increase our expenses including the impact associated with preventive and precautionary measures that we other businesses and governments are taking These measures have led to unprecedented restrictions on disruptions in and other related impacts on businesses and personal activities In addition to travel restrictions put in place in early 2020 governments have closed borders imposed prolonged quarantines and may continue those measures or implement other restrictions and requirements in light of the continuing spread of the pandemic We expect that these evolving restrictions and requirements as well as the corresponding need to adapt to new methods of conducting business remotely will continue to have an adverse effect on our business Risks associated with COVID19 include but are not limited to the following  We have experienced and expect to continue to experience significant and unpredictable reductions or increases in demand for certain of our products as healthcare customers reprioritize the treatment of 6 patients Some of our products are particularly sensitive to reductions in elective medical procedures and as hospital systems prioritize treatment of COVID19 patients and otherwise comply with government guidelines many of those procedures have been suspended or postponed in our principal markets In the second third and fourth quarters of 2020 this resulted in lower levels of general hospital admissions and elective surgery volumes in those markets which negatively impacted the demand for certain of our products It is not possible to predict the timing of a broad resumption of elective medical procedures If patients and hospital systems continue to deprioritize delay or cancel these procedures our business financial condition and results of operations would continue to be negatively affected  A significant number of our suppliers manufacturers distributors and vendors have been adversely affected by the COVID19 pandemic including with respect to the ability of their employees to get to their places of work and maintain the continuity of their onsite operations These impacts could impair our ability to move our products through distribution channels to end customers Any delay or shortage in the supply of components or materials or other operational or logistical challenges may result in our inability to satisfy consumer demand for our products in a timely manner or at all which could harm our reputation future sales and profitability For example we have experienced and expect to continue to experience supply constraints for amino acid raw materials used in our parenteral nutrition products as such materials are also being used to produce COVID19 vaccines  We could experience a loss of sales and profitability due to delayed payments reduced demand or insolvency of healthcare professionals hospitals and other customers and suppliers and vendors facing liquidity or other financial issues These liquidity or other financial issues could be exacerbated if prolonged high levels of unemployment or loss of insurance coverage impact patients ability to access treatments that use our products and services  COVID19 could adversely impact our ability to retain key employees and the continued service and availability of skilled personnel necessary to run our operations including members of our management as well as the ability of our suppliers manufacturers distributors and vendors to retain their key employees To the extent our management or other personnel are impacted in significant numbers by COVID19 and are not available to perform their professional duties we could experience delays in or the suspension of our manufacturing operations research and development activities and other functions  We face increased operational challenges as we continue to take measures to support and protect employee health and safety including through office closures and work from home policies For example remote working arrangements heighten our risks associated with information technology systems and networks including cyberattacks computer viruses malicious software security breaches and telecommunication failures both for systems and networks we control directly and for those that employees and thirdparty developers rely on to work remotely Any failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches or cyber risks or detect or respond adequately to a security breach or cyber risk or any other disruptions to our information technology systems and networks as a result of remote working arrangements or otherwise can have adverse effects on our business and cause reputational and financial harm These risks are particularly heightened due to COVID19 as cybercriminals attempt to profit from the disruptions caused by the uncertain environment  COVID19 and related impacts have affected and may further affect the global economy and capital markets worldwide which among other consequences may restrict our access to capital increase financing costs adversely affect our liquidity the perceptions of our creditworthiness and our ability to complete acquisitions and increase volatility in foreign currency exchange rates 7 The extent of the impact from the pandemic depends on future developments that cannot be predicted at this time such as the severity and duration of the pandemic including of related resurgences and future mutations or outbreaks of related strains of the virus the extent and effectiveness of containment efforts including the effectiveness and acceptance of any vaccines for COVID19 and the direct and indirect impact of the pandemic on our employees customers counterparties service providers and regulators as well as other market participants Any of these and other impacts of the pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations Finally to the extent COVID19 adversely affects our operations and global economic conditions more generally many of the other risks described in this Risk Factors section may be heightened Risks Related to Our Ability to Grow Our Business If we are unable to successfully introduce new products or fail to keep pace with advances in technology our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected We need to successfully introduce new products to achieve our strategic business objectives Product development requires substantial investment and there is inherent risk in the RD process A successful product development process depends on many factors including our ability to properly anticipate and satisfy customer needs adapt to new technologies obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis demonstrate satisfactory clinical results manufacture products in an economical and timely manner and differentiate our products from those of our competitors If we cannot successfully introduce new products or adapt to changing technologies our products may become obsolete and our revenue and profitability could suffer Issues with product supply or quality could have an adverse effect on our business or cause a loss of customer confidence in us or our products among other negative consequences Our success depends upon the availability and quality of our products The pharmaceutical and medical products industries are competitive and subject to complex market dynamics and varying demand levels These levels vary in response to macroeconomic conditions regulatory requirements including the availability of private or public reimbursement seasonality natural disasters pandemics epidemics and other matters For example as hospital systems prioritized treatment of COVID19 patients elective medical procedures were suspended or postponed in our principal markets which negatively impacted demand for certain products Additionally the development of new or enhanced products involves a lengthy regulatory process and is capital intensive As a result our ability to match our production levels and capacity to market demand is imprecise and may result in a failure to meet market demand or satisfy customer requirements for our products or alternatively an oversupply of inventory Failure to meet market demand may result in customers transitioning to available competitive products loss of market share negative publicity reputational damage loss of customer confidence or other negative consequences including a decline in stock price In the event of an oversupply we may be forced to lower our prices record asset impairment charges or take other actions which may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations Our success also depends on our ability to maintain and routinely improve product quality and our quality management program Quality management plays an essential role in meeting customer requirements preventing defects improving our products and services and assuring the safety and efficacy of our products While we have a quality system that covers the lifecycle of our products quality and safety issues have and may in the future occur with respect to our products New or unintended uses of our product for example in response to COVID19 or changing clinical practice may also raise quality or safety issues A quality or safety issue may result in adverse inspection reports voluntary or official action indicated warning letters import bans product recalls either voluntary or required by FDA or similar governmental authorities in other countries or seizures monetary sanctions injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of products civil or criminal sanctions costly litigation refusal of a government to grant approvals and licenses restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses See Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters An inability to address a quality or safety issue in an effective and timely manner may also cause negative publicity a loss of customer confidence in us or our current or future products which may result in the loss of sales and difficulty in successfully launching new products Additionally we have made and continue to make significant investments in assets including inventory and property plant and equipment which relate to potential new products or modifications to existing products Product quality or safety issues may restrict us from being able to realize the expected returns from these investments potentially resulting in asset impairments in the future 8 Unaffiliated thirdparty suppliers provide a number of goods and services to our RD clinical and manufacturing organizations Third party suppliers are required to comply with our quality standards Failure of a thirdparty supplier to provide compliant raw materials or supplies could result in delays service interruptions or other quality related issues that may negatively impact our business results There is substantial competition in the product markets in which we operate Although no single company competes with us in all of our businesses we face substantial competition in all of our markets from international and domestic healthcare and pharmaceutical companies and providers of all sizes and these competitors often differ across our businesses Competition is primarily focused on costeffectiveness price service product performance and technological innovation Competition may increase further as additional companies begin to enter our markets or modify their existing products to compete directly with ours If our competitors respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or we do not introduce new versions or upgrades to our product portfolio in response to those requirements our products may be rendered obsolete or noncompetitive If our competitors develop more effective or affordable products or achieve earlier patent protection or product commercialization than we do our business financial condition and operations will likely be negatively affected If we are forced to reduce our prices due to increased competition our business could become less profitable Our sales could be adversely affected if any of our contracts with GPOs IDNs or other customers are terminated due to increased competition or otherwise In addition many health care industry companies including health care systems distributors manufacturers providers and insurers are consolidating or have formed strategic alliances As the health care industry consolidates competition to provide goods and services to industry participants will become more intense Further this consolidation creates larger enterprises with greater negotiating power which they can use to negotiate price concessions If we face an increase in costs or must reduce our prices because of industry consolidation or if we lose customers as a result of consolidation our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected If our business development activities are unsuccessful we may not realize the intended benefits We expect to continue to engage in business development activities including evaluating acquisitions joint development opportunities technology licensing arrangements and other opportunities These activities may result in substantial investment of our resources Our success developing products or expanding into new markets from such activities will depend on a number of factors including our ability to find suitable opportunities for acquisition investment or alliance competition from other companies in the industries in which we operate that are seeking similar opportunities whether we are able to complete an acquisition investment or alliance on terms that are satisfactory to us the strength of the other companys underlying technology products and ability to execute its business strategies any intellectual property and litigation related to the other companys products or technology and our ability to successfully integrate the acquired company business product technology or research into our existing operations including the ability to adequately fund acquired inprocess RD projects and to maintain adequate controls over the combined operations Certain of these activities are subject to antitrust and competition laws which laws could impact our ability to pursue strategic transactions and could result in mandated divestitures in the context of proposed acquisitions If we are unsuccessful in our business development activities we may not realize the intended benefits of such activities including that acquisition and integration costs may be greater than expected or the possibility that expected return on investment synergies and accretion will not be realized or will not be realized within the expected timeframes For more information on recent business development activities see Note 2 in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10K If we fail to attract and retain key employees our business may suffer Our ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract and retain key employees including people in senior management sales marketing information technology and RD positions Competition for top talent in the 9 healthcare industry can be intense Our ability to recruit and retain such talent will depend on a number of factors including hiring practices of our competitors compensation and benefits work location work environment and industry economic conditions If we cannot effectively recruit and retain qualified employees our business could suffer Risks Related to Our Business Operations If we are unable to obtain sufficient components or raw materials on a timely basis or for a costeffective price or if we experience other manufacturing sterilization supply or distribution difficulties our business and results of operations may be adversely affected The manufacture of our products requires among other things the timely supply or delivery of sufficient amounts of quality components and materials We manufacture our products in approximately 50 manufacturing facilities around the world We acquire our components materials and other requirements for manufacturing from many suppliers and vendors in various countries including sometimes from ourselves for selfsupplied requirements We endeavor either alone or working closely with our suppliers to ensure the continuity of our inputs and supplies but we cannot guarantee these efforts will always be successful Further while efforts are made to diversify certain of our sources of components and materials in certain instances there is only a sole source or supplier with no alternatives yet identified For most of our components and materials for which a single source or supplier is used alternative sources or suppliers may exist but we have made a strategic determination to use the single source or supplier Although we do carry strategic inventory and maintain insurance to help mitigate the potential risk related to any supply disruption there can be no assurance that such measures will be sufficient or effective A reduction or interruption in supply an issue in the supply chain including issues due to the revocation of distribution facilities licenses and our inability to quickly develop acceptable alternative sources for such supply could adversely affect our ability to manufacture distribute and sell our products in a timely or costeffective manner Moreover changes in regulation world trade policies international taxes and governmenttogovernment relations and issues with export and import activities could negatively impact our ability to distribute products within a country and across countries See Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters Additionally volatility in our costs of energy transportationfreight components raw materials and other supply manufacturing and distribution costs could adversely affect our results of operations Climate change including laws or regulations passed in response thereto could increase our costs in particular our costs of supply energy and transportationfreight Material or sustained increases in the price of oil could have an adverse impact on the cost of many of the plastic materials we use to make and package our products as well as our transportationfreight costs These outcomes may in turn result in customers transitioning to available competitive products loss of market share negative publicity reputational damage loss of customer confidence or other negative consequences including a decline in stock price Many of our products are difficult to manufacture This is due to the complex nature of manufacturing pharmaceuticals including biologics and devices as well as the strict regulatory regime governing our manufacturing operations Variations in the manufacturing process may result in production failures which could lead to launch delays product shortage unanticipated costs lost revenues and damage to our reputation A failure to identify and address manufacturing problems prior to the release of products to our customers may also result in a quality or safety issue of the type discussed above Some of our products are manufactured at a single manufacturing facility or stored at a single storage site Loss or damage to or closure of a manufacturing facility or storage site due to a natural disaster such as we experienced as a result of Hurricane Maria a pandemic such as COVID19 or otherwise could adversely affect our ability to manufacture sufficient quantities of key products or deliver products to meet customer demand or contractual requirements which may result in a loss of revenue and other adverse business consequences including those identified in the paragraphs above In addition several of our manufacturing facilities are leased and we may not be able to renew leases on favorable terms or at all Because of the time required to approve and license a manufacturing facility a thirdparty manufacturer may not be available on a timely basis if at all to replace production capacity in the event we lose manufacturing capacity or products are otherwise unavailable Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations Some of our products require sterilization prior to sale or distribution and we utilize both Baxterowned and thirdparty facilities for this process If an event occurs that results in damage to or closure whether temporarily or permanent of one or more of these facilities we may be unable to manufacture or sterilize the relevant products at prior levels or at all and a third party may not be available on a timely basis if at all to replace sterilization capacity 10 For example in February 2020 certain air emission control technology used to reduce ethylene oxide emissions from sterilization equipment at our facility in Mountain Home Arkansas was tested and determined not to operate in accordance with applicable emission limitations in our stateissued air permit Although we received a temporary variance and have recommenced operations these events or other disruptions of manufacturing or sterilization processes that we or third parties may experience whether due to lack of capacity environmental regulatory or compliance issues or otherwise could result in product shortage unanticipated costs loss of revenues litigation and damage to our reputation all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations Breaches and breakdowns affecting our information technology systems or protected data including from cyber security breaches and data leakage could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition cash flows reputation and competitive position We rely upon information technology systems and infrastructure including support provided by our partners and third parties to support our business our products and our customers For example we routinely rely on our technology systems and infrastructure to aid us in the collection use storage and transfer disclosure and other processing of voluminous amounts of data including confidential business financial personal patient and other sensitive information collectively Confidential Information We also rely on systems for manufacturing customer orders shipping regulatory compliance and various other matters Certain of our products and systems collect data regarding patients and their therapy and some are internet enabled or connect to our systems for maintenance and other purposes Some of our products even though not internet enabled nor connected to our systems connect to hospital networks electronic medical records or electronic health records The continuing evolution of technology we use including cloudbased computing and reliance on third parties creates additional opportunities for the unintentional intentional andor unauthorized exposure dissemination andor destruction of Confidential Information stored in our devices systems servers infrastructure and products collectively Technology Security threats including cyber and other attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated frequent and adaptive Our Technology is vulnerable to breakdown interruption cyber and other security attacks system malfunction unauthorized access inadvertent exposure or disclosure of information theft and other events Thirdparty systems that we rely upon could also become vulnerable to the same risks and may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could result in system disruption or compromise the information security of our own systems Any such vulnerability could compromise our Technology and could expose Confidential Information to unauthorized third parties andor cause permanent loss of such data In addition to loss of Confidential Information unauthorized access to or interference with our Technology may cause product functionality issues that may result in risk to patient safety field actions andor product recalls We have like other large multinational companies experienced cyber incidents in the past and may experience them in the future which have exposed and may continue to expose vulnerabilities in our information technology systems Although the prior incidents have not had a material effect on our business and we have invested and continue to invest in the protection of data and Technology there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns attacks breaches in our Technology cyber incidents or other incidents or ensure compliance with all applicable security and privacy laws regulations and standards including with respect to thirdparty service providers that host or process Confidential Information on our behalf Such incidents could result in unauthorized access to patient data and other Confidential Information and could pose a risk to patient safety Any failure to protect against such incidents can lead to substantial and material regulatory fines and penalties business disruption reputational harm financial loss litigation as well as other damages Misappropriation or other loss of our intellectual property from any of the foregoing may have an adverse effect on our competitive position and may cause us to incur substantial litigation costs See Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters As the FDA other regulators and our customers become more sensitive to risks related to cybersecurity our ability to meet certain information technology safety standards could affect our products marketability and competitiveness We could also suffer strained relationships with customers business partners physicians and other healthcare professionals increased costs for security measures remediation or otherwise litigation including class actions and stockholder derivative actions or other negative consequences including a decline in stock price from breaches cyber and other security attacks industrial espionage ransomware email or phishing scams malware or other cyber incidents which may compromise our system infrastructure or lead to data leakage either internally or at our thirdparty providers or other business partners In addition significant implementation issues may arise as we continue to consolidate and outsource certain computer operations and application support activities Further a greater number of our employees are working remotely in response to the COVID19 pandemic and related government actions which among other things could 11 expose us to greater risks related to cybersecurity and our information technology systems We also face all of the same risks listed above and other heightened risks when acquiring a company in particular if we need to transition or implement certain processes or controls with the acquired company We are subject to risks associated with doing business globally Our operations are subject to risks inherent in conducting business globally and under the laws regulations and customs of various jurisdictions and geographies These risks include changes in exchange controls and other governmental actions loss of business in government and public tenders that are held annually in many cases increasingly complex labor environments availability of raw materials changes in taxation tariffs export control restrictions changes in or violations of US or local laws dependence on a few government entities as customers pricing restrictions economic and political instability monetary or currency volatility or instability including as it relates to the US dollar the Euro the Yuan and currencies in emerging market countries disputes between countries trade relationships and conflicts diminished or insufficient protection of intellectual property and disruption or destruction of operations in a significant geographic region regardless of cause including natural disaster pandemic power loss cyberattack data breach war terrorism riot labor disruption civil insurrection or social unrest Failure to comply with or material changes to the laws and regulations that affect our global operations could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations On January 31 2020 the United Kingdom UK formally left the European Union EU commonly known as Brexit when the UKEU Withdrawal Agreement became effective Under the Withdrawal Agreement a transition period began that ran until December 31 2020 On January 1 2021 the UK left the EU Single Market and Customs Union as well as all EU policies and international agreements As a result the free movement of persons goods services and capital between the UK and the EU ended and the EU and the UK formed two separate markets and two distinct regulatory and legal spaces On December 24 2020 the European Commission reached a trade agreement with the UK on the terms of its future cooperation with the EU Trade Agreement The Trade Agreement offers UK and EU companies preferential access to each others markets ensuring imported goods will be free of tariffs and quotas however economic relations between the UK and the EU will now be on more restricted terms than existed previously The withdrawal by the UK from the EU could result in the deterioration of economic conditions volatility in currency exchange rates and increased regulatory complexities as well as the potential for product shortages increased costs or other similar effects These outcomes could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations The escalating global economic competition and trade tensions between the US and China could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations Although we have been able to mitigate some of the impact from increased duties imposed by both countries through petitioning both governments for tariff exclusions and other mitigations the risk remains of additional tariffs and other kinds of restrictions Tariff exclusions awarded to us by the US Government require annual renewal and policies for granting exclusions could shift The US and China could impose other types of restrictions such as limitations on government procurement or technology export restrictions which could affect our access to the markets More generally several governments including the US have raised the possibility of policies to induce reshoring of supply chains less reliance on imported supplies and greater national production One example would be the stronger Buy American requirements in the US pursuant to a US executive order by the new Administration on January 25 2021 or US withdrawal from the World Trade Organization Agreement on Government Procurement GPA If such steps triggered retaliation in other markets such as by restricting access to foreign products in purchases by their governmentowned healthcare systems the outcomes could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters We are subject to a number of laws and regulations noncompliance with which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and we are susceptible to a changing regulatory environment As a participant in the healthcare industry our operations and products and those of our customers are regulated by numerous government agencies both inside and outside the United States The impact of this on us is direct to 12 the extent we are subject to these laws and regulations and indirect in that in a number of situations even though we may not be directly regulated by specific healthcare laws and regulations our products must be capable of being used by our customers in a manner that complies with those laws and regulations The manufacture distribution marketing and use of our products are subject to extensive regulation and scrutiny by FDA and other regulatory authorities globally Any new product must undergo lengthy and rigorous testing and other extensive costly and timeconsuming procedures mandated by FDA and foreign regulatory authorities The same testing and procedures sometimes apply to current products that are up for authorization or renewal or are subject to changes in laws or regulations for example certain of our medical devices will have to comply with the new European Union Medical Device Regulation when it enters into force in May 2021 Changes to current products may be subject to vigorous review including additional 510k and other regulatory submissions and approvals or the time needed to secure approvals are not certain Our facilities must be approved and licensed prior to production and remain subject to inspection from time to time thereafter Failure to comply with the requirements of FDA or other regulatory authorities including a failed inspection or a failure in our adverse event reporting system could result in adverse inspection reports voluntary or official action indicated warning letters import bans product recalls or seizures monetary sanctions reputational damage injunctions to halt the manufacture and distribution of products civil or criminal sanctions refusal of a government to grant approvals or licenses restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses Any of these actions could cause a loss of customer confidence in us and our products which could adversely affect our sales The requirements of regulatory authorities including interpretative guidance are subject to change and compliance with additional or changing requirements or interpretative guidance may subject us to further review result in product launch delays or otherwise increase our costs For information on current regulatory issues affecting us please refer to the caption entitled Certain Regulatory Matters in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10K In connection with these issues there can be no assurance that additional costs or civil and criminal penalties will not be incurred that additional regulatory actions with respect to us will not occur that we will not face civil claims for damages from purchasers or users that substantial additional charges or significant asset impairments may not be required that sales of other products may not be adversely affected or that additional regulation will not be introduced that may adversely affect our operations and consolidated financial statements The sales marketing and pricing of products and relationships that pharmaceutical and medical device companies have with healthcare providers are under increased scrutiny by federal state and foreign government agencies Compliance with the AntiKickback Statute False Claims Act Food Drug and Cosmetic Act including as these laws relate to offlabel promotion of products and other healthcare related laws as well as competition data and patient privacy and export and import laws is under increased focus by the agencies charged with overseeing such activities including FDA OIG DOJ and the Federal Trade Commission The DOJ and the SEC have also increased their focus on the enforcement of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act FCPA particularly as it relates to the conduct of pharmaceutical and medical product companies The FCPA and similar antibribery laws generally prohibit companies and their employees contractors or agents from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business Healthcare professionals in many countries are employed by the government and consequently may be considered government officials Foreign governments have also increased their scrutiny of pharmaceutical and medical product companies sales and marketing activities and relationships with healthcare providers and competitive practices generally The laws and standards governing the promotion pricing sale and reimbursement of our products and those governing our relationships with healthcare providers and governments including the Sunshine Act enacted under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended the PPACA can be complicated are subject to frequent change and may be violated unknowingly We are also subject to environmental laws which are becoming more stringent throughout the world For example the EPA regulates the use of ethylene oxide for sterilization of medical devices as is increasingly focused on reducing emissions from the ethylene oxide sterilization process which has increased our costs of operations and necessitated changes to our manufacturing plants and processes Other environmental laws may have similar consequences to us or our suppliers or result in liability to us The enactment of additional laws in the future may increase our compliance costs or otherwise adversely impact our operations Additionally the US Department of the Treasurys Office of Foreign Control and the Bureau of Industry and Security at the US Department of Commerce administer laws and regulations that restrict US persons and in some instances nonUS persons in conducting activities transacting business or making investments in certain countries or with governments entities and individuals subject to US economic sanctions From time to time 13 certain of our subsidiaries have limited business dealings with countries subject to these sanctions including Iran Sudan Syria Russia and Cuba These dealings represent an insignificant amount of our consolidated revenues and income but expose us to an increased risk of operating in these countries including foreign exchange risks or restrictions or limitations on our ability to access funds generated in these jurisdictions or the risk of violating applicable sanctions or regulations which are complex and subject to frequent change Additional restrictions may be enacted enforced or interpreted in a way that may adversely affect our operations We have compliance programs in place including policies training and various forms of monitoring designed to address the risks discussed above Nonetheless these programs and policies may not always protect us from conduct by individual employees that violate these laws Violations or allegations of violations of these laws may result in large civil and criminal penalties debarment or exclusion from participating in government programs diversion of management time attention and resources and may otherwise have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations For more information related to our ongoing government investigations please refer to Note 7 in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10K For more information on regulatory matters currently affecting us including qualityrelated matters refer to the discussion under the caption entitled Certain Regulatory Matters in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10K The laws and regulations discussed above are broad in scope and subject to evolving interpretations which could require us to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of our sales and marketing practices and may subject us to enforcement actions or litigation which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations Increasing regulatory focus on privacy and security issues and expanding laws could impact our business and expose us to increased liability As a global company we are subject to global data privacy and security laws regulations and codes of conduct that apply to our businesses We are required to comply with increasingly complex and changing legal and regulatory requirements that govern the collection use storage security transfer disclosure and other processing of personal data in the United States and in other countries including but not limited to The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act as amended HIPAA The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act the California Consumer Privacy Act CCPA and the European Unions General Data Protection Regulation GDPR The GDPR imposes stringent European Union data protection requirements and provides for significant penalties for noncompliance HIPAA also imposes stringent data privacy and security requirements and the regulatory authority has imposed significant fines and penalties on organizations found to be out of compliance CCPA provides consumers with a private right of action against companies who have a security breach due to lack of appropriate security measures We or our thirdparty providers and business partners may also be subjected to audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign government agencies relating to compliance with information security and privacy laws and regulations and noncompliance with the laws and regulations could result in substantial and material fines or class action litigation If reimbursement or other payment for our current or future products is reduced or modified in the United States or in foreign countries including through the implementation or repeal of governmentsponsored healthcare reform or other similar actions cost containment measures or changes to policies with respect to pricing taxation or rebates our business could suffer Sales of our products depend in part on the extent to which the costs of our products are paid by both public and private payers These payers include Medicare Medicaid and private healthcare insurers in the United States and foreign governments and thirdparty payers outside the United States Our work with government payers carries various risks inherent in working with government entities and agencies including government reporting and auditing additional regulatory oversight mandated contractual terms failure of government appropriations or other complex procedural requirements Public and private payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services We may continue to experience downward pricing pressures from any or all of these payers which could result in an adverse effect on our business financial condition and operational results 14 Global efforts toward healthcare cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing Governments around the world use various mechanisms to control healthcare expenditures such as price controls the formation of public contracting authorities product formularies which are lists of recommended or approved products and competitive tenders which require the submission of a bid to sell products Sales of our products are dependent in part on the availability of reimbursement by government agencies and healthcare programs as well as insurance companies and other private payers In much of Europe Latin America Asia and Australia for example the government provides healthcare at low cost to patients and controls its expenditures by purchasing products through public tenders collective purchasing regulating prices setting reference prices in public tenders or limiting reimbursement or patient access to certain products Additionally austerity measures or other reforms by foreign governments may limit reduce or eliminate payments for our products and adversely affect both pricing flexibility and demand for our products The PPACA includes several provisions which impact our businesses in the United States including increased Medicaid rebates and an expansion of the 340B Drug Pricing Program which provides certain qualified entities such as hospitals serving disadvantaged populations with discounts on the purchase of drugs for outpatient use and an excise tax on the sale of certain drugs The PPACA reduces Medicare and Medicaid payments to hospitals and other providers which may cause us to experience downward pricing pressure Certain portions of the PPACA could negatively impact the demand for our products and therefore our results of operations and financial position There have been multiple attempts to repeal or amend the PPACA through legislative action and legal challenges and the most recent challenge is currently before the US Supreme Court Recent changes to the composition of the Supreme Court may increase the likelihood that the PPACA is repealed or impacted in some manner In the event the PPACA is repealed or significantly altered it would impact our business in a number of ways some of which may be material Following a 2019 executive order from former President Donald Trump the US Department of Health and Human Services announced the launch of a new kidney health initiative The Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services CMS published the final end stage renal disease Treatment Choices mandatory payment model ETC on September 18 2020 The ETC launched in 30 of dialysis clinics across the country on January 1 2021 and creates payment incentives for the greater use of home dialysis and kidney transplants for those already on dialysis CMS also announced the implementation of four voluntary payment models with the stated goal of helping healthcare providers reduce the cost and improve the quality of care for patients with latestage chronic kidney disease and ESRD CMS has stated these payment models are aimed to prevent or delay the need for dialysis and encourage kidney transplantation These voluntary payment models have a scheduled commencement date of April 2021 but applicants now have the option to delay implementation until January 2022 These proposed regulatory changes in kidney health policy and reimbursement may substantially change the US end stage renal disease market and could increase demand for our peritoneal dialysis products necessitating significant multiyear capital expenditures in order to meet that demand However the impact of such changes and related expenses are difficult to estimate in advance In addition a substantial portion of our revenues is dependent on federal healthcare program reimbursement and any disruptions in federal government operations including a federal government shutdown or failure of the US government to enact annual appropriations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations Additionally disruptions in federal government operations may negatively impact regulatory approvals and guidance that are important to our operations and create uncertainty about the pace of upcoming healthcare regulatory developments or approvals As a result of these and other measures including future measures or reforms that cannot be predicted reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive basis Legislation and regulations affecting reimbursement for our products may change at any time and in ways that may be adverse to us We cannot predict the impact of these pressures and initiatives or any negative effects of any additional regulations that may affect our business 15 If we are unable to protect our patents or other proprietary rights or if we infringe the patents or other proprietary rights of others our competitiveness and business prospects may be materially damaged Patent and other proprietary rights are essential to our business Our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to obtain and enforce patents and licenses to patent rights both in the United States and in other countries We cannot guarantee that pending patent applications will result in issued patents that patents issued or licensed will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors that our patents will not be found to be invalid or that the intellectual property rights of others will not prevent us from selling certain products or including key features in our products The patent position of a healthcare company is often uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions Significant litigation concerning patents and products is pervasive in our industry Patent claims include challenges to the coverage and validity of our patents on products or processes as well as allegations that our products infringe patents held by competitors or other third parties An unfavorable litigation outcome in any of these types of cases could result in a loss of patent protection or the ability to market products which could lead to a significant loss of sales or otherwise materially affect future results of operations We also rely on trademarks copyrights trade secrets and knowhow to develop maintain and strengthen our competitive positions Third parties may know discover or independently develop equivalent proprietary information or techniques or they may gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our trade secrets to the public Although our employees consultants parties to collaboration agreements and other business partners are generally subject to confidentiality or similar agreements to protect our confidential and proprietary information these agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach To the extent that our employees consultants parties to collaboration agreements and other business partners use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting knowhow and inventions Furthermore our intellectual property other proprietary technology and other sensitive company data is potentially vulnerable to loss damage or misappropriation from system malfunction computer viruses unauthorized access to our data or misappropriation or misuse thereof by those with permitted access and other events While we have invested to protect our intellectual property confidential information and other data and continue to work diligently in this area there can be no assurance that our precautionary measures will prevent breakdowns breaches cyber incidents or other events Such events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition or results of operations Misappropriation or other loss of our intellectual property from any of the foregoing would have an adverse effect on our competitive position and may cause us to incur substantial litigation costs Changes in tax laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities may have a negative impact on our operating results Changes to the tax laws in the United States or other countries in which we operate could have an adverse effect on our operating results In particular the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and the regulations issued thereunder collectively 2017 Tax Act including among other things certain changes in tax rates deductibility of interest deductibility of executive compensation expense expensing of capital expenditures the ability to use certain tax credits taxation on earnings from international business operations and the treatment of deductible payments made by our US affiliates to our foreign affiliates could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations In certain instances the 2017 Tax Act could have a negative effect on our tax rate and the carrying value of tax balances Any of these changes could adversely affect our financial performance There remains some uncertainty regarding aspects of the implementation of the 2017 Tax Act that could potentially have adverse impacts on us We cannot currently predict the full impact that the 2017 Tax Act may have over time on our business including revenues profit margins profitability operating cash flows and results of operations For more information regarding the impact of the 2017 Tax Act see Note 12 in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10K Similarly the outcome of various initiatives currently being undertaken by the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development could significantly impact how we allocate profits across multiple jurisdictions which could adversely impact our global tax obligations 16 Taxing authorities audit us from time to time and may disagree with certain positions we have taken in respect of our tax liabilities Our tax liabilities are affected by many factors including the amounts we charge in intracompany transactions for inventory services licenses funding and other items which are subject to the use of assumptions and judgment Because we operate in multiple income tax jurisdictions both inside and outside the United States cross border transactions among our affiliates are a significant part of the manner in which we operate Although we believe that we transact intracompany business in accordance with armslength principles tax authorities may disagree with our intracompany charges crossjurisdictional transfer pricing or other matters and may assess additional taxes as a result including in connection with their review of the restated financial statements we have filed as part of our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10K We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision However we may not accurately predict the outcome of these audits and as a result the actual outcome of these audits may have an adverse impact on our financial results For more information on ongoing audits see Note 12 in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10K We are party to a number of pending lawsuits and other disputes which may have an adverse impact on our business operations or financial condition We are party to a number of pending lawsuits settlement discussions mediations arbitrations and other disputes In addition in the future we may be party to such disputes including patent product liability or other lawsuits These current and future matters may result in a loss of patent protection reduced revenue incurrence of significant liabilities and diversion of our managements time attention and resources Given the uncertain nature of litigation and other disputes generally we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome in these current matters In view of these uncertainties the outcome of these matters may result in charges in excess of any established reserves and to the extent available liability insurance We also continue to be selfinsured with respect to product liability claims The absence of thirdparty insurance coverage for current or future claims increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims and adverse decisions Protracted litigation and other disputes including any adverse outcomes may have an adverse impact on our business operations or financial condition Even claims without merit could subject us to adverse publicity and require us to incur significant legal fees See Note 7 in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10K for more information regarding current lawsuits We identified certain misstatements to our previously issued financial statements and have restated the financial statements described below the restatement which has exposed us to a number of additional risks and uncertainties As discussed in the Explanatory Note in Note 2 Restatement of Previously Issued Consolidated Financial Statements and in Note 19 Quarterly Financial Data Unaudited in our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10K we restated certain of our previously issued audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements and selected financial information to correct misstatements of certain foreign exchange gains and losses from foreign currency denominated intracompany loan receivables and payables cash balances and gains and losses from foreign currency derivative contracts which we determined were material to these periods As a result of the misstatements and the restatement we have become subject to additional risks and uncertainties and costs including as a result of a pending classaction lawsuit and a stockholder request for inspection of our books and records As initially disclosed on October 24 2019 we also voluntarily advised the staff of the SEC of our previously disclosed internal investigation and we are continuing to cooperate with the staff of the SEC We may become subject to enforcement proceedings brought by the SEC or other regulatory or governmental authorities or subject to other legal proceedings as a result of the events leading to our internal investigation the misstatements or the related restatement and actions and proceedings could also be brought against our current and former employees officers or directors These actions lawsuits or other legal proceedings related to the misstatements or the restatement could result in reputational harm additional defense and other costs regardless of the outcome of the lawsuit or proceeding If we do not prevail in any such lawsuit or proceeding we could be subject to substantial damages or settlement costs criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures including but not limited to injunctive relief disgorgement civil and criminal fines and penalties In addition we continue to be at risk for loss of investor confidence loss of key employees changes in management or our board of directors and other reputational issues all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations 17 Risks Related to the Economy and Our Financial Performance Current or worsening economic conditions may adversely affect our business and financial condition Our ability to generate cash flows from operations could be affected if there is a material decline in the demand for our products in the solvency of our customers or suppliers or deterioration in our key financial ratios or credit ratings Current or worsening economic conditions may adversely affect the ability of our customers including governments to pay for our products and services and the amount spent on healthcare generally This could result in a decrease in the demand for our products and services declining cash flows longer sales cycles slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition These conditions may also adversely affect certain of our suppliers which could cause a disruption in our ability to produce our products We continue to do business with foreign governments in certain countries including Greece and Italy which have experienced deterioration in credit and economic conditions While global economic conditions have not significantly impacted our ability to collect receivables liquidity issues in certain countries have resulted and may continue to result in delays in the collection of receivables and credit losses These conditions may also impact the stability of the US dollar Euro or Yuan Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and liquidity We generate the majority of our revenue and profit outside the United States As a result our financial results have been and may in the future be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates We cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or our ability to mitigate these risks We may experience additional volatility as a result of inflationary pressures and other macroeconomic factors including in emerging market countries We are also exposed to changes in interest rates and our ability to access the money markets and capital markets could be impeded if market conditions are not favorable A discussion of the financial impact of foreign exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations and the ways and extent to which we attempt to mitigate such impact is contained under the caption Financial Instrument Market Risk in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10K Our operating results and financial condition may fluctuate Our operating results and financial condition may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year for a number of reasons Events such as a delay in product development changes to our expectations or strategy or even a relatively small revenue shortfall may cause financial results for a period to be below our expectations or projections As a result we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and these comparisons should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance Our operating results and financial condition are also subject to fluctuation from all of the risks described throughout this section These fluctuations may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and our stock price We may not achieve our financial goals We continue to evaluate and refine both our shortterm and longterm financial objectives These include for example our stated objective to improve our gross margin Our strategy to achieve these objectives is focused on strengthening our portfolio and extending our impact through transformative innovation that spans prevention to recovery As part of this strategy we intend to invest in portfolio innovation and market development and entering adjacencies while continuing to drive operational excellence through ongoing business transformation efforts and organization optimization We will also look to unlock additional value through strategic capital deployment We may fail to achieve our targeted financial results if we are unsuccessful in implementing our strategies our estimates or assumptions change or for any other reason Our failure to achieve our financial goals could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 18 Future material impairments in the value of our longlived assets including goodwill could negatively affect our operating results We regularly review our longlived assets including identifiable intangible assets goodwill which results from our acquisition activity and property plant and equipment for impairment Goodwill and acquired indefinite life intangible assets are subject to impairment review on an annual basis and whenever potential impairment indicators are present Other longlived assets are reviewed when there is an indication that impairment may have occurred Changes in market conditions or other changes in the future outlook of value may lead to impairment charges in the future In addition we may from time to time sell assets that we determine are not critical to our strategy including in connection with strategic exits Future events or decisions may lead to asset impairments andor related charges Certain noncash impairments may result from a change in our strategic goals business direction or other factors relating to the overall business environment Material impairment charges could negatively affect our results of operations For more information on the valuation and impairment of longlived assets refer to the discussion under the caption entitled Critical Accounting Policies in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10K There could be significant liability if the separation and distribution or any Retained Shares Transaction is determined to be a taxable transaction Baxalta has indemnified us for certain potential liabilities that may arise and such indemnification obligation is guaranteed by Shire but Baxalta and Shire may be unable to satisfy their indemnification obligations to us in the future The separation and distribution and the Retained Shares Transactions collectively the Baxter Transactions qualify for taxfree treatment to Baxter and its stockholders under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as amended the Code Completion of the separation and distribution was conditioned upon among other things the receipt of a private letter ruling from the IRS regarding certain issues relating to the taxfree treatment of the Baxter Transactions Although the IRS private letter ruling is generally binding on the IRS the continuing validity of such ruling is subject to the accuracy of factual representations and assumptions made in the ruling Completion of the distribution was also conditioned upon Baxters receipt of a tax opinion from KPMG LLP regarding certain aspects of the Baxalta separation not covered by the IRS private letter ruling The opinion was based upon various factual representations and assumptions as well as certain undertakings made by Baxter and Baxalta If any of the factual representations or assumptions in the IRS private letter ruling or tax opinion is untrue or incomplete in any material respect if any undertaking is not complied with or if the facts upon which the IRS private letter ruling or tax opinion are based are materially different from the actual facts relating to the Baxter Transactions the opinion or IRS private letter ruling may not be valid Moreover opinions of a tax advisor are not binding on the IRS As a result the conclusions expressed in the opinion of a tax advisor could be successfully challenged by the IRS If the Baxter Transactions are determined to be taxable Baxter and its stockholders could incur significant tax liabilities Pursuant to the tax matters agreement Baxalta agreed to indemnify us for certain taxrelated losses incurred if Baxaltas actions cause the separation and distribution and certain related transactions to fail to qualify for taxfree status under the applicable provisions of the Code In anticipation of the merger between Baxalta and Shire the Merger we entered into a letter agreement with Shire and Baxalta the Letter Agreement Under the Letter Agreement Baxalta agreed to indemnify and Shire agreed to guarantee such indemnity to Baxter and each of its affiliates and each of their respective officers directors and employees against certain taxrelated losses attributable to or resulting from in whole or in part the Merger as further described in the Letter Agreement If the Baxter Transactions are determined to be taxable as a result in whole or in part of the Merger for example if the Merger is deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the Baxter Transactions Baxter and its stockholders could incur significant tax liabilities Although Baxalta and Shire may be required to indemnify Baxter under the tax matters agreement and the Letter Agreement for any such tax liabilities incurred by Baxter there can be no assurance that the indemnity from Baxalta or the guarantee thereof by Shire will be sufficient to protect us against all or a part of the amount of such liabilities or that either Baxalta or Shire will fully satisfy their respective obligations Even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from Baxalta or Shire any amounts for which we are held liable we may be required to bear these costs initially which could negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition 19 Item 1B Unresolved Staff Comments None Item 2 Properties Our corporate offices are
