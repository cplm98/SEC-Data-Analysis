sales franchises see Note 17 in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10K 1 Sales and Distribution The company has its own direct sales force and also makes sales to and through independent distributors drug wholesalers acting as sales agents and specialty pharmacy or other alternate site providers In the United States third parties such as Cardinal Health Inc warehouse and ship a significant portion of the companys products through their distribution centers These centers are generally stocked with adequate inventories to facilitate prompt customer service Sales and distribution methods include frequent contact by sales and customer service representatives automated communications via various electronic purchasing systems circulation of catalogs and merchandising bulletins directmail campaigns trade publication presence and advertising International sales are made and products are distributed on a direct basis or through independent distributors or sales agents in more than 100 countries as of December 31 2016 International Operations The majority of the companys revenues are generated outside of the United States and geographic expansion remains a component of the companys strategy Baxters international presence includes operations in Europe including Eastern and Central Europe the Middle East Africa AsiaPacific Latin America and Canada The company is subject to certain risks inherent in conducting business outside the United States For more information on these risks see the information under the captions Risks Related to Baxters Business We are subject to risks associated with doing business globally and  Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and liquidity in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10K For financial information about foreign and domestic operations and geographic information see Note 17 in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10K For more information regarding foreign currency exchange risk refer to the discussion under the caption entitled Financial Instrument Market Risk in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10K Contractual Arrangements Substantial portions of the companys products are sold through contracts with customers both within and outside the United States Some of these contracts have terms of more than one year and place limits on the companys ability to increase prices In the case of hospitals governments and other facilities these contracts may specify minimum quantities of a particular product or categories of products to be purchased by the customer In keeping with the increased emphasis on costeffectiveness in healthcare delivery many hospitals and other customers of medical products in the United States have joined group purchasing organizations GPOs or formed integrated delivery networks IDNs to enhance purchasing power GPOs and IDNs negotiate pricing arrangements with manufacturers and distributors and the negotiated prices are made available to members Baxter has purchasing agreements with several of the major GPOs in the United States GPOs may have agreements with more than one supplier for certain products Accordingly in these cases Baxter faces competition from other suppliers even where a customer is a member of a GPO under contract with Baxter Purchasing power is similarly consolidated in many other countries For example public contracting authorities act as the purchasing entities for the hospitals and other customers of medical products in their region and many hospitals and other customers have joined joint procurement entities and buying consortia The result is that demand for healthcare products is increasingly concentrated across the companys markets globally Raw Materials Raw materials essential to Baxters business are purchased from numerous suppliers worldwide in the ordinary course of business Although most of these materials are generally available Baxter at times may experience shortages of supply In an effort to manage risk associated with raw materials supply Baxter works closely with its suppliers to help ensure availability and continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability The company also seeks to develop new and alternative sources of supply where beneficial to its overall raw materials procurement strategy The company also utilizes longterm supply contracts with some suppliers to help maintain continuity of supply and manage the risk of price increases Baxter is not always able to recover cost increases for raw materials through customer pricing due to contractual limits and market forces In connection with the separation and distribution Baxter entered into a longterm manufacturing and supply agreement with Baxalta Baxalta manufactures and supplies Baxter with ARTISS TISSEEL FLOSEAL and standalone thrombin under the manufacturing and supply agreement on a costplus basis 2 Competition and Healthcare Cost Containment Baxters Hospital Products and Renal businesses benefit from a number of competitive advantages including the breadth and depth of their product offerings as well as strong relationships with customers including hospitals and clinics group purchasing organizations physicians and patients many who selfadminister the homebased therapies supplied by Baxter Baxter as a whole benefits from efficiencies and cost advantages resulting from shared manufacturing facilities and the technological advantages of its products Although no single company competes with Baxter in all of its businesses Baxter faces substantial competition in each of its segments from international and domestic healthcare and pharmaceutical companies and providers of all sizes and these competitors often differ across our businesses In addition global and regional competitors continue to expand their manufacturing capacity and sales and marketing channels Competition is primarily focused on costeffectiveness price service product performance and technological innovation There has been increasing consolidation in the companys customer base and by its competitors which continues to result in pricing and market pressures Global efforts toward healthcare cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing Governments around the world use various mechanisms to control healthcare expenditures such as price controls the formation of public contracting authorities product formularies lists of recommended or approved products and competitive tenders which require the submission of a bid to sell products Sales of Baxters products are dependent in part on the availability of reimbursement by government agencies and healthcare programs as well as insurance companies and other private payers In the United States the federal and many state governments have adopted or proposed initiatives relating to Medicaid and other health programs that may limit reimbursement or increase rebates that Baxter and other providers are required to pay to the state In addition to government regulation managed care organizations in the United States which include medical insurance companies medical plan administrators healthmaintenance organizations hospital and physician alliances and pharmacy benefit managers continue to put pressure on the price and usage of healthcare products Managed care organizations seek to contain healthcare expenditures and their purchasing strength has been increasing due to their consolidation into fewer larger organizations and a growing number of enrolled patients Baxter faces similar issues outside of the United States In Europe and Latin America for example the government provides healthcare at low cost to patients and controls its expenditures by purchasing products through public tenders collective purchasing regulating prices setting reference prices in public tenders or limiting reimbursement or patient access to certain products Intellectual Property Patents and other proprietary rights are essential to Baxters business Baxter relies on patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets knowhow and confidentiality agreements to develop maintain and strengthen its competitive position Baxter owns a number of patents and trademarks throughout the world and has entered into license arrangements relating to various thirdparty patents and technologies Products manufactured by Baxter are sold primarily under its own trademarks and trade names Some products distributed by the company are sold under the companys trade names while others are sold under trade names owned by its suppliers or partners Trade secret protection of unpatented confidential and proprietary information is also important to Baxter The company maintains certain details about its processes products and technology as trade secrets and generally requires employees consultants and business partners to enter into confidentiality agreements These agreements may be breached and Baxter may not have adequate remedies for any breach In addition Baxters trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors To the extent that Baxters employees consultants and business partners use intellectual property owned by others in their work for the company disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting knowhow and inventions Baxters policy is to protect its products and technology through patents and trademarks on a worldwide basis This protection is sought in a manner that balances the cost of such protection against obtaining the greatest value for the company Baxter also recognizes the need to promote the enforcement of its patents and trademarks and takes commercially reasonable steps to enforce its patents and trademarks around the world against potential infringers including judicial or administrative action where appropriate Baxter operates in an industry susceptible to significant patent litigation At any given time the company is involved as either a plaintiff or defendant in a number of patent infringement and other intellectual propertyrelated actions Such litigation can result in significant royalty or other payments or result in injunctions that can prevent the sale of products For more information on patent and other litigation see Note 16 in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10K Research and Development Baxters investment in research and development RD consistent with the companys portfolio optimization and capital allocation strategies helps fuel its future growth and its ability to remain competitive in each of its business segments Accordingly Baxter continues to focus its investment on select RD programs to enhance future growth through clinical differentiation Expenditures for Baxters RD activities were 647 million in 2016 603 million in 2015 and 610 million in 2014 These expenditures include costs 3 associated with RD activities performed at the companys RD centers located around the world which include facilities in Belgium Sweden Italy Germany China Japan and the United States as well as inlicensing milestone and reimbursement payments made to partners for RD work performed at nonBaxter locations For more information on the companys RD activities refer to the discussion under the caption entitled Strategic Objectives in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10K Quality Management Baxters continued success depends upon the quality of its products Quality management plays an essential role in determining and meeting customer requirements preventing defects facilitating continuous improvement of the companys processes products and services and assuring the safety and efficacy of the companys products Baxters quality system enables the design development manufacturing packaging sterilization handling distribution and labeling of the companys products to ensure they conform to customer requirements In order to continually improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the quality system various measurements monitoring and analysis methods such as management reviews and internal external and vendor audits are employed at local and central levels Each product that Baxter markets is required to meet specific quality standards both in packaging and in product integrity and quality If any of those is determined to be compromised at any time Baxter endeavors to take corrective and preventive actions designed to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and to meet customer expectations For more information on corrective actions taken by Baxter refer to the discussion under the caption entitled Certain Regulatory Matters in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10K Government Regulation The operations of Baxter and many of the products manufactured or sold by the company are subject to extensive regulation by numerous government agencies both within and outside the United States The Food and Drug Administration FDA in the United States the European Medicines Agency EMA in Europe the China Food and Drug Administration CFDA in China and other government agencies inside and outside of the United States administer requirements covering the testing safety effectiveness manufacturing labeling promotion and advertising distribution and postmarket surveillance of Baxters products The company must obtain specific approval from FDA and nonUS regulatory authorities before it can market and sell most of its products in a particular country Even after the company obtains regulatory approval to market a product the product and the companys manufacturing processes and quality systems are subject to continued review by FDA and other regulatory authorities globally State agencies in the United States also regulate the facilities operations employees products and services of the company within their respective states The company and its facilities are subject to periodic inspections and possible administrative and legal actions by FDA and other regulatory agencies inside and outside the United States Such actions may include warning letters product recalls or seizures monetary sanctions injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of products civil or criminal sanctions refusal of a government to grant approvals or licenses restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses As situations require the company takes steps to ensure safety and efficacy of its products such as removing products found not to meet applicable requirements from the market and improving the effectiveness of quality systems For more information on compliance actions taken by the company refer to the discussion under the caption entitled Certain Regulatory Matters in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10K The company is also subject to various laws inside and outside the United States concerning its relationships with healthcare professionals and government officials price reporting and regulation the promotion sales and marketing of its products and services the importation and exportation of products the operation of its facilities and distribution of products In the United States the company is subject to the oversight of FDA Office of the Inspector General within the Department of Health and Human Services OIG the Center for MedicareMedicaid Services CMS the Department of Justice DOJ Environmental Protection Agency Department of Defense and Customs and Border Protection in addition to others The company supplies products and services to healthcare providers that are reimbursed by federally funded programs such as Medicare As a result the companys activities are subject to regulation by CMS and enforcement by OIG and DOJ In each jurisdiction outside the United States the companys activities are subject to regulation by government agencies including the EMA in Europe CFDA in China and other agencies in other jurisdictions Many of the agencies enforcing these laws have increased their enforcement activities with respect to healthcare companies in recent years These actions appear to be part of a general trend toward increased enforcement activity globally Environmental policies of the company require compliance with all applicable environmental regulations and contemplate among other things appropriate capital expenditures for environmental protection 4 Emplo yees As of December 31 2016 Baxter employed approximately 48000

Secretary Baxter International Inc One Baxter Parkway Deerfield Illinois 60015 Information contained on Baxters website shall not be deemed incorporated into or to be a part of this Annual Report on Form 10K Item 1A Risk Factors In addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10K stockholders or prospective investors should carefully consider the following risk factors If any of the events described below occurs our business financial condition and results of operations and future growth prospects could suffer Risks Related to Baxters Business We may not achieve our longterm financial improvement goals We have begun implementing plans to enhance profitability and returns for our stockholders These plans include the achievement of certain financial goals including improved operating margin in 2017 and beyond While we are continuing to refine these goals our plan contemplates significant margin expansion over our longrange plan which runs through 2020 We have identified certain key strategies to help achieve these targets These strategies include optimizing our core product portfolio globally driving operational excellence through the rebasing of our cost structure and various restructuring activities and maximizing the value derived from the allocation of our capital As part of these strategies we continue to evaluate the performance of all of our businesses and may sell or acquire a business or product line or exit a particular market We are also evaluating our corporate and commercial infrastructure in the interest of streamlining costs while maintaining our commitment to quality and safety Future divestitures may result in significant writeoffs including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets Future acquisitions may fail to achieve the desired financial results including return on investment and synergies and may not provide the desired market access The restructuring of our operations may not generate targeted savings or may cause unexpected disruptions to our business As a result we may not achieve our targeted financial results which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations If we are unable to successfully introduce new products or fail to keep pace with advances in technology our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected We need to successfully introduce new products to achieve our strategic business objectives Product development requires substantial investment and there is inherent risk in the research and development process A successful product development process depends on many factors including our ability to properly anticipate and satisfy customer needs adapt to new technologies obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis demonstrate satisfactory clinical results manufacture products in an economical and timely manner and differentiate our products from those of our competitors If we cannot successfully introduce new products or adapt to changing technologies our products may become obsolete and our revenue and profitability could suffer Issues with product supply or quality could have an adverse effect upon our business subject us to regulatory actions and cause a loss of customer confidence in us or our products Our success depends upon the availability and quality of our products The medical products industry is competitive and subject to complex market dynamics and varying demand levels These levels vary in response to macroeconomic conditions regulatory requirements including the availability of private or public reimbursement and seasonality Additionally the development of new or enhanced products involves a lengthy regulatory process and is capital intensive As a result our ability to match our production levels and capacity to market demand is imprecise and may result in a failure to meet market demand or satisfy customer requirements for our products or alternatively an oversupply of inventory Failure to meet market demand may result in customers transitioning to 5 available competitive products resulting in a loss of market share or customer confidence In the event of an oversupply we may be forced to lower our prices or record asset impairment charges or take other action which may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations Additionally quality management plays an essential role in determining and meeting customer requirements preventing defects improving the companys products and services and assuring the safety and efficacy of our products Our future success depends on our ability to maintain and continuously improve our quality management program While we have a quality system that covers the lifecycle of our products quality and safety issues may occur with respect to any of our products A quality or safety issue may result in adverse inspection reports warning letters product recalls either voluntary or required by the FDA or similar governmental authorities in other countries or seizures monetary sanctions injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of products civil or criminal sanctions costly litigation refusal of a government to grant approvals and licenses restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses An inability to address a quality or safety issue in an effective and timely manner may also cause negative publicity a loss of customer confidence in us or our current or future products which may result in the loss of sales and difficulty in successfully launching new products Additionally Baxter has made and continues to make significant investments in assets including inventory and property plant and equipment which relate to potential new products or modifications to existing products Product quality or safety issues may restrict the company from being able to realize the expected returns from these investments potentially resulting in asset impairments in the future Unaffiliated third party suppliers provide a number of goods and services to our RD clinical and manufacturing organizations Third party suppliers are required to comply with our quality standards Failure of a third party supplier to provide compliant raw materials or supplies could result in delays service interruptions or other quality related issues that may negatively impact our business results For more information on regulatory matters currently affecting us refer to the discussion under the caption entitled Certain Regulatory Matters in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10K We are subject to a number of existing laws and regulations noncompliance with which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and we are susceptible to a changing regulatory environment As a participant in the healthcare industry our operations and products and those of our customers are regulated by numerous government agencies both inside and outside the United States The impact of this on us is direct to the extent we are subject to these laws and regulations and indirect in that in a number of situations even though we may not be directly regulated by specific healthcare laws and regulations our products must be capable of being used by our customers in a manner that complies with those laws and regulations The manufacture distribution marketing and use of our products are subject to extensive regulation and scrutiny by FDA and other regulatory authorities globally Any new product must undergo lengthy and rigorous testing and other extensive costly and timeconsuming procedures mandated by FDA and foreign regulatory authorities Changes to current products may be subject to vigorous review including additional 510k and other regulatory submissions and approvals are not certain Our facilities must be approved and licensed prior to production and remain subject to inspection from time to time thereafter Failure to comply with the requirements of FDA or other regulatory authorities including a failed inspection or a failure in our adverse event reporting system could result in adverse inspection reports warning letters product recalls or seizures monetary sanctions injunctions to halt the manufacture and distribution of products civil or criminal sanctions refusal of a government to grant approvals or licenses restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses Any of these actions could cause a loss of customer confidence in us and our products which could adversely affect our sales The requirements of regulatory authorities including interpretative guidance are subject to change and compliance with additional or changing requirements or interpretative guidance may subject the company to further review result in product launch delays or otherwise increase our costs For information on current regulatory issues affecting us please refer to the caption entitled Certain Regulatory Matters in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10K In connection with these issues there can be no assurance that additional costs or civil and criminal penalties will not be incurred that additional regulatory actions with respect to the company will not occur that the company will not face civil claims for damages from purchasers or users that substantial additional charges or significant asset impairments may not be required that sales of other products may not be adversely affected or that additional regulation will not be introduced that may adversely affect the companys operations and consolidated financial statements The sales marketing and pricing of products and relationships that pharmaceutical and medical device companies have with healthcare providers are under increased scrutiny by federal state and foreign government agencies Compliance with the AntiKickback Statute False Claims Act Food Drug and Cosmetic Act including as these laws relate to offlabel promotion of products and other healthcare related laws as well as competition data and patient privacy and export and import laws is under increased focus by the agencies charged with overseeing such activities including FDA OIG DOJ and the Federal Trade Commission The DOJ and the Securities and Exchange Commission have also increased their focus on the enforcement of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 6 FCPA particularly as it relates to the conduct of pharmaceutical and medical product companies The FCPA and similar antibribery laws generally prohibit companies and their employees contractors or agents from making improper payments t o government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business Healthcare professionals in many countries are employed by the government and consequently may be considered government officials Foreign governments have also increased their scru tiny of pharmaceutical and medical product companies sales and marketing activities and relationships with healthcare providers and competitive practices generally The laws and standards governing the promotion sale and reimbursement of our products and those governing our relationships with healthcare providers and governments including the Sunshine Act enacted under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act can be complicated are subject to frequent change and may be violated unknowingly Additionally the US Department of the Treasurys Office of Foreign Control and the Bureau of Industry and Security at the US Department of Commerce administer laws and regulations that restrict US persons and in some instances nonUS persons in conducting activities transacting business or making investments in certain countries governments entities and individuals subject to US economic sanctions From time to time certain of our subsidiaries have limited business dealings in countries subject to these sanctions including Iran Sudan Syria Cuba and Russia These dealings represent an insignificant amount of our consolidated revenues and income but expose us to an increased risk of violating applicable sanctions regulations which are complex and subject to frequent change Additional restrictions may be enacted enforced or interpreted in a way that may adversely affect our operations We have compliance programs in place including policies training and various forms of monitoring designed to address the risks discussed above Nonetheless these programs and policies may not always protect us from conduct by individual employees that violate these laws Violations or allegations of violations of these laws may result in large civil and criminal penalties debarment from participating in government programs diversion of management time attention and resources and may otherwise have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations For more information related to the companys ongoing government investigations please refer to Note 16 in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10K The laws and regulations discussed above are broad in scope and subject to evolving interpretations which could require us to incur substantial cost associated with compliance or to alter one or more of our sales and marketing practices and may subject us to enforcement actions which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations If reimbursement or other payment for our current or future products is reduced or modified in the United States or abroad including through the implementation of governmentsponsored healthcare reform or other similar actions cost containment measures or changes to policies with respect to pricing taxation or rebates then our business could suffer Sales of our products depend in part on the extent to which the costs of our products are paid by both public and private payers These payers include Medicare Medicaid and private health care insurers in the United States and foreign governments and thirdparty payers outside the United States Public and private payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services We may continue to experience continued downward pricing pressures from any or all of these payers which could result in an adverse effect on our business financial condition and operational results Global efforts toward healthcare cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing Governments around the world use various mechanisms to control healthcare expenditures such as price controls the formation of public contracting authorities product formularies lists of recommended or approved products and competitive tenders which require the submission of a bid to sell products Sales of our products are dependent in part on the availability of reimbursement by government agencies and healthcare programs as well as insurance companies and other private payers In much of Europe Latin America Asia and Australia for example the government provides healthcare at low cost to patients and controls its expenditures by purchasing products through public tenders collective purchasing regulating prices setting reference prices in public tenders or limiting reimbursement or patient access to certain products Additionally austerity measures or other reforms by foreign governments may limit reduce or eliminate payments for our products and adversely affect both pricing flexibility and demand for our products For example in the United States the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act PPACA which was signed into law in March 2010 includes several provisions which impact our businesses in the United States including increased Medicaid rebates and an expansion of the 340B Drug Pricing Program which provides certain qualified entities such as hospitals serving disadvantaged populations with discounts on the purchase of drugs for outpatient use and an excise tax on the sale of certain drugs The PPACA reduces Medicare and Medicaid payments to hospitals and other providers which may cause us to experience downward pricing pressure Members of Congress and the Executive Branch have made statements suggesting plans to seek repeal of all or portions of the PPACA Because of the continued uncertainty about the implementation of the PPACA including the potential for legal challenges or repeal of that legislation we cannot quantify or predict the likely impact of any change in or replacement of the PPACA on our business and the demand for our products 7 As a result of these and other measures including future measures or reforms that cannot be predicted reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive basis Legislation and regulations affecting reimbursement for our products may change at any time and in ways that may be adverse to us We cannot predict the impact of these pressures and initiatives or any nega tive effects of any additional regulations that may affect our business There is substantial competition in the product markets in which we operate Although no single company competes with us in all of our businesses we face substantial competition in both of our segments from international and domestic healthcare and pharmaceutical companies and providers of all sizes and these competitors often differ across our businesses Competition is primarily focused on costeffectiveness price service product performance and technological innovation Competition may increase further as additional companies begin to enter our markets or modify their existing products to compete directly with ours If our competitors respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or we do not introduce new versions or upgrades to our product portfolio in response to those requirements our products may be rendered obsolete or noncompetitive If our competitors develop more effective or affordable products or achieve earlier patent protection or product commercialization than we do our operations will likely be negatively affected If we are forced to reduce our prices due to increased competition our business could become less profitable The companys sales could be adversely affected if any of its contracts with GPOs IDNs or other customers are terminated due to increased competition or otherwise If our business development activities are unsuccessful our business could suffer and our financial performance could be adversely affected As part of our longterm strategy we are engaged in business development activities including evaluating acquisitions joint development opportunities technology licensing arrangements and other opportunities These activities may result in substantial investment of the companys resources Our success developing products or expanding into new markets from such activities will depend on a number of factors including our ability to find suitable opportunities for acquisition investment or alliance whether we are able to complete an acquisition investment or alliance on terms that are satisfactory to us the strength of the other companys underlying technology products and ability to execute its business strategies any intellectual property and litigation related to these products or technology and our ability to successfully integrate the acquired company business product technology or research into our existing operations including the ability to adequately fund acquired inprocess research and development projects and to maintain adequate controls over the combined operations Certain of these activities are subject to antitrust and competition laws which laws could impact our ability to pursue strategic transactions and could result in mandated divestitures in the context of proposed acquisitions If we are unsuccessful in our business development activities we may be unable to meet our financial targets and our financial performance could be adversely affected For more information on recent business development activities see Note 5 in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10K If we are unable to obtain sufficient components or raw materials on a timely basis or if we experience other manufacturing or supply difficulties our business may be adversely affected The manufacture of our products requires the timely delivery of sufficient amounts of quality components and materials We manufacture our products in approximately 50 manufacturing facilities around the world We acquire our components and materials from many suppliers in various countries We work closely with our suppliers to ensure the continuity of supply but we cannot guarantee these efforts will always be successful Further while efforts are made to diversify our sources of components and materials in certain instances we acquire components and materials from a sole supplier For most of our components and materials for which a sole supplier is used we believe that alternative sources of supply exist and have made a strategic determination to use a sole supplier In very limited instances however we do rely upon sole supplier relationships for which no alternatives have currently been identified Although we do carry strategic inventory and maintain insurance to mitigate the potential risk related to any related supply disruption there can be no assurance that such measures will be effective Due to the regulatory environment in which we operate we may be unable to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for some components or materials A reduction or interruption in supply and an inability to develop alternative sources for such supply could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products in a timely or costeffective manner and our ability to make product sales Many of our products are difficult to manufacture This is due to the complex nature of manufacturing pharmaceuticals including biologics and devices as well as the strict regulatory regime governing our manufacturing operations Variations in the manufacturing process may result in production failures which could lead to launch delays product shortage unanticipated costs lost revenues and damage to our reputation A failure to identify and address manufacturing problems prior to the release of products to our customers may also result in a quality or safety issue of the type discussed above 8 Some of our products are manufactured at a single manufacturing facility or stored at a s ingle storage site Loss or damage to a manufacturing facility or storage site due to a natural disaster or otherwise could adversely affect our ability to manufacture sufficient quantities of key products or otherwise deliver products to meet customer dem and or contractual requirements which may result in a loss of revenue and other adverse business consequences Because of the time required to approve and license a manufacturing facility a third party manufacturer may not be available on a timely basis to replace production capacity in the event we lose manufacturing capacity or products are otherwise unavailable due to natural disaster regulatory action or otherwise If we are unable to protect our patents or other proprietary rights or if we infringe the patents or other proprietary rights of others our competitiveness and business prospects may be materially damaged Patent and other proprietary rights are essential to our business Our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to obtain and enforce patents and licenses to patent rights both in the United States and in other countries We cannot guarantee that pending patent applications will result in issued patents that patents issued or licensed will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors that our patents will not be found to be invalid or that the intellectual property rights of others will not prevent the company from selling certain products or including key features in the companys products The patent position of a healthcare company is often uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions Significant litigation concerning patents and products is pervasive in our industry Patent claims include challenges to the coverage and validity of our patents on products or processes as well as allegations that our products infringe patents held by competitors or other third parties A loss in any of these types of cases could result in a loss of patent protection or the ability to market products which could lead to a significant loss of sales or otherwise materially affect future results of operations We also rely on trademarks copyrights trade secrets and knowhow to develop maintain and strengthen our competitive positions Third parties may know discover or independently develop equivalent proprietary information or techniques or they may gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our trade secrets to the public Although our employees consultants parties to collaboration agreements and other business partners are generally subject to confidentiality or similar agreements to protect our confidential and proprietary information these agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach To the extent that our employees consultants parties to collaboration agreements and other business partners use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting knowhow and inventions Furthermore our intellectual property other proprietary technology and other sensitive company data is potentially vulnerable to loss damage or misappropriation from system malfunction computer viruses unauthorized access to our data or misappropriation or misuse thereof by those with permitted access and other events While we have invested to protect our intellectual property and other data and continue to work diligently in this area there can be no assurance that our precautionary measures will prevent breakdowns breaches cyber incidents or other events Such events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition or results of operations Misappropriation or other loss of our intellectual property from any of the foregoing would have an adverse effect on our competitive position and may cause us to incur substantial litigation costs We are subject to risks associated with doing business globally Our operations are subject to risks inherent in conducting business globally and under the laws regulations and customs of various jurisdictions and geographies These risks include changes in exchange controls and other governmental

intellectual property and disruption or destruction of operations in a significant geographic region regardless of cause including war terrorism riot civil insurrection or social unrest Failure to comply with or material changes to the laws and regulations that affect our global operations could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations The 2016 referendum by British voters to exit the European Union EU commonly known as Brexit has created uncertainties affecting business operations in the EU The UK government is expected to initiate a process to withdraw from the EU in the coming months A withdrawal could result in the deterioration of economic conditions volatility in currency exchange rates as evidenced by the deterioration in the value of the British pound as compared to the US dollar following the Brexit vote and increased regulatory complexities These outcomes could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 9 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and liquidity We generate the majority of our revenue and profit outside the United States As a result our financial results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates We cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or our ability to mitigate these risks We may experience additional volatility as a result of inflationary pressures and other macroeconomic factors in certain emerging market countries We are also exposed to changes in interest rates and our ability to access the money markets and capital markets could be impeded if adverse liquidity market conditions occur A discussion of the financial impact of foreign exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations and the ways and extent to which we attempt to mitigate such impact is contained under the caption Financial Instrument Market Risk in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10K Changes in tax laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities may have a negative impact on our operating results Tax policy reform continues to be a topic of discussion in the United States Members of the newly installed US Congress including the Speaker of the House Paul Ryan have identified comprehensive tax reform as a priority for 2017 A significant change to the tax system in the United States including changes to the taxation of international income or imported product could have an adverse effect upon our results of operations Because we operate in multiple income tax jurisdictions both inside and outside the United States cross border transactions among our affiliates are a significant part of the manner in which we operate Although we believe that we transact intercompany business in accordance with armslength principles taxing authorities may audit us from time to time disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision However we may not accurately predict the outcome of these audits and as a result the actual outcome of these audits may have an adverse impact on our financial results For more information on ongoing audits see Note 15 in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10K We are increasingly dependent on information technology systems and subject to privacy and security laws and our systems and infrastructure face certain risks including from cyber security breaches and data leakage We increasingly rely upon technology systems and infrastructure Our technology systems are potentially vulnerable to breakdown or other interruption by fire power loss system malfunction unauthorized access and other events Likewise data privacy breaches by employees and others with both permitted and unauthorized access to our systems and products may pose a risk that sensitive data including protected health information PHI may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public or may be permanently lost The increasing use and evolution of technology including cloudbased computing creates additional opportunities for the unintentional dissemination of information intentional destruction of confidential information stored in our systems products or in nonencrypted portable media or storage devices We could also experience a business interruption information theft of confidential information or reputational damage from industrial espionage attacks malware or other cyber incidents which may compromise our system infrastructure or lead to data leakage either internally or at our thirdparty providers or other business partners As our products continue to evolve thirdparties may attempt to access or obtain proprietary information from our products or systems Additionally we must comply with numerous federal and state laws and regulations governing the collection dissemination access use security and PHI including The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and its implementing privacy and security regulations While we have invested heavily in the protection of data and information technology and in related training there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent significant breakdowns breaches in our systems or other cyber incidents or ensure compliance with all applicable security and privacy laws regulations and standards including with respect to thirdparty service providers that utilize sensitive personal information including PHI on our behalf Any such breakdown breach incident or failure to comply could have a material adverse effect upon our reputation business operations or financial condition In addition significant implementation issues may arise as we continue to consolidate and outsource certain computer operations and application support activities If we fail to attract and retain key employees our business may suffer Our ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract and retain key employees including people in senior management sales marketing and research positions Competition for top talent in healthcare can be intense Our ability to recruit and retain such talent will depend on a number of factors including hiring practices of our competitors compensation and benefits work location work environment and industry economic conditions If we cannot effectively recruit and retain qualified employees our business could suffer We are subject to a number of pending lawsuits We are a defendant in a number of pending lawsuits In addition we may be named as a defendant in future patent product liability or other lawsuits These current and future matters may result in a loss of patent protection reduced revenue significant liabilities and 10 diversion of our managements time attention and resources Given the uncertain nature of litigation generally we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome in these current matters In view of these uncertainties the outcome of these matters may result in charges in excess of any established reserves and to the extent available liability insurance We also continue to b e selfinsured with respect to product liability claims The absence of thirdparty insurance coverage for current or future claims increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims and adverse decisions Protracted litigation including any adverse outcomes may have an adverse impact on the business operations or financial condition of the company Even claims without merit could subject us to adverse publicity and require us to incur significant legal fees See Note 16 in Item 8 of this Annual Re port on Form 10K for more information regarding current lawsuits Current or worsening economic conditions may adversely affect our business and financial condition The companys ability to generate cash flows from operations could be affected if there is a material decline in the demand for the companys products in the solvency of its customers or suppliers or deterioration in the companys key financial ratios or credit ratings Current or worsening economic conditions may adversely affect the ability of our customers including governments to pay for our products and services and the amount spent on healthcare generally This could result in a decrease in the demand for our products and services declining cash flows longer sales cycles slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition These conditions may also adversely affect certain of our suppliers which could cause a disruption in our ability to produce our products We continue to do business with foreign governments in certain countries including Greece Spain Portugal and Italy which have experienced deterioration in credit and economic conditions As of December 31 2016 the companys net accounts receivable from the public sector in Greece Spain Portugal and Italy totaled 137 million While global economic conditions have not significantly impacted the companys ability to collect receivables liquidity issues in certain countries have resulted and may continue to result in delays in the collection of receivables and credit losses These conditions may also impact the stability of the Euro or Yuan For more information on accounts receivable and credit matters with respect to certain of these countries refer to the discussion under the caption entitled Credit Facilities Access to Capital and Credit Ratings in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10K We may incur operational difficulties or be exposed to claims and liabilities as a result of the separation and distribution On July 1 2015 we distributed approximately 805 of the outstanding shares of Baxalta common stock to Baxter stockholders in connection with the separation of our biopharmaceuticals business We disposed of our remaining 195 stake in Baxalta Retained Shares in 2016 in connection with a series of transactions including debtforequity exchanges an equityforequity exchange and a contribution to our US pension plan Retained Shares Transactions Shire plc Shire acquired Baxalta in June 2016 after completion of the last Retained Shares Transaction In connection with the July 2015 distribution we entered into a separation and distribution agreement and various other agreements including a transition services agreement a tax matters agreement a long term services agreement a manufacturing and supply agreement an employee matters agreement a trademark license agreement a Galaxy license agreement an international commercial operations agreement a shareholders and registration rights agreement and certain other commercial agreements with Baxalta These agreements govern the separation and distribution and the relationship between the companies going forward including with respect to potential taxrelated losses associated with the separation and distribution and the Retained Shares Transactions They also provide for the performance of services by each company for the benefit of the other for a period of time including under the manufacturing and supply agreement pursuant to which Shire now manufactures and sells certain products and materials to us The separation and distribution agreement provides for indemnification obligations designed to make Baxalta financially responsible for many liabilities that may exist relating to its business activities whether incurred prior to or after the distribution including any pending or future litigation It is possible that a court would disregard the allocation agreed to between us and Baxalta and require us to assume responsibility for obligations allocated to Baxalta Third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of these liabilities or obligations and the indemnity rights we have under the separation and distribution agreement may not be sufficient to fully cover all of these liabilities and obligations Even if we are successful in obtaining indemnification we may have to bear costs temporarily In addition our indemnity obligations to Baxalta may be significant These risks could negatively affect our business financial condition or results of operations The separation of Baxalta continues to involve a number of risks including among other things the indemnification risks described above and the potential that managements and our employees attention will be significantly diverted by the provision of transitional services Certain of the agreements described above provide for the performance of services by each company for the benefit of the other for a period of time Shire may elect to extend the term for which we provide services to Baxalta under these agreements If Baxalta is unable to satisfy its obligations under these agreements including its indemnification obligations we could incur losses These arrangements could also lead to disputes over rights to certain shared property and rights and over the allocation of costs and revenues for products and operations Our inability to effectively manage the separation activities and related events could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 11 There could be signific ant liability if the separation and distribution or any Retained Shares Transaction is determined to be a taxable transaction Baxalta has indemnified us for certain potential liabilities that may arise and such indemnification obligation is guaranteed by Shire but Baxalta and Shire may be unable to satisfy their indemnification obligations to us in the future The separation and distribution and the Retained Shares Transactions collectively the Baxter Transactions qualify for taxfree treatment to Baxter and its stockholders under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as amended the Code Completion of the separation and distribution was conditioned upon among other things the receipt of a private letter ruling from the IRS regarding certain issues relating to the taxfree treatment of the Baxter Transactions Although the IRS private letter ruling is generally binding on the IRS the continuing validity of such ruling is subject to the accuracy of factual representations and assumptions made in the ruling Completion of the distribution was also conditioned upon Baxters receipt of a tax opinion from KPMG LLP regarding certain aspects of the Baxalta spinoff not covered by the IRS private letter ruling The opinion was based upon various factual representations and assumptions as well as certain undertakings made by Baxter and Baxalta If any of the factual representations or assumptions in the IRS private letter ruling or tax opinion is untrue or incomplete in any material respect if any undertaking is not complied with or if the facts upon which the IRS private letter ruling or tax opinion are based are materially different from the actual facts relating to the Baxter Transactions the opinion or IRS private letter ruling may not be valid Moreover opinions of a tax advisor are not binding on the IRS As a result the conclusions expressed in the opinion of a tax advisor could be successfully challenged by the IRS If the Baxter Transactions are determined to be taxable Baxter and its stockholders could incur significant tax liabilities Pursuant to the tax matters agreement Baxalta agreed to indemnify us for certain taxrelated losses incurred if Baxaltas actions cause the separation and distribution and certain related transactions to fail to qualify for taxfree status under the applicable provisions of the Code In anticipation of the proposed Baxalta  Shire merger the Merger we entered into a letter agreement with Shire and Baxalta the Letter Agreement Under the Letter Agreement Baxalta agreed to indemnify and Shire agreed to guarantee such indemnity to Baxter and each of its affiliates and each of their respective officers directors and employees against certain taxrelated losses attributable to or resulting from in whole or in part the merger as further described in the Letter Agreement If the Baxter Transactions are determined to be taxable as a result in whole or in part of the merger for example if the merger is deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the Baxter Transactions Baxter and its stockholders could incur significant tax liabilities Although Baxalta and Shire may be required to indemnify Baxter under the tax matters agreement and the Letter Agreement for any such tax liabilities incurred by Baxter there can be no assurance that the indemnity from Baxalta or the guarantee thereof by Shire will be sufficient to protect us against all or a part of the amount of such liabilities or that either Baxalta or Shire will be able to fully satisfy their respective obligations Even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from Baxalta or Shire any amounts for which we are held liable we may be temporarily required to bear these costs ourselves which could negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition Item 1B Unresolved Staff Comments None
