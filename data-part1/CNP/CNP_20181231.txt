and regional reliability coordinator for member electric power systems in most of Texas The ERCOT market represents approximately 90 of the demand for power in Texas and is one of the nations largest power markets The ERCOT market operates under the reliability standards developed by the NERC approved by the FERC and monitored and enforced by the Texas RE The PUCT has primary jurisdiction over the ERCOT market to ensure the adequacy and reliability of electricity supply across the states main interconnected power transmission grid Houston Electric does not make direct retail or wholesale sales of electric energy or own or operate any electric generating facilities 3 Houston Electrics distribution service territory as of December 31 2018 is depicted below Electric Transmission On behalf of REPs Houston Electric delivers electricity from power plants to substations from one substation to another and to retail electric customers taking power at or above 69 kV in locations throughout Houston Electrics certificated service territory Houston Electric constructs and maintains transmission facilities and provides transmission services under tariffs approved by the PUCT The ERCOT ISO is responsible for operating the bulk electric power supply system in the ERCOT market Houston Electrics transmission business along with those of other owners of transmission facilities in Texas supports the operation of the ERCOT ISO Houston Electric participates with the ERCOT ISO and other ERCOT utilities to plan design obtain regulatory approval for and construct new transmission lines necessary to increase bulk power transfer capability and to remove existing constraints on the ERCOT transmission grid Electric Distribution In ERCOT end users purchase their electricity directly from certificated REPs Houston Electrics distribution network receives electricity from the transmission grid through power distribution substations and delivers electricity for REPs in its certificated service area by carrying lowervoltage power from the substation to the retail electric customer through distribution feeders Houston Electrics operations include construction and maintenance of distribution facilities metering services outage response services and call center operations Houston Electric provides distribution services under tariffs approved by the PUCT PUCT rules and market protocols govern the commercial operations of distribution companies and other market participants Rates for these existing services are established pursuant to rate proceedings conducted before municipalities that have original jurisdiction and the PUCT Bond Companies Houston Electric has special purpose subsidiaries consisting of the Bond Companies which it consolidates The consolidated special purpose subsidiaries are whollyowned bankruptcy remote entities that were formed solely for the purpose of purchasing and owning transition or system restoration property through the issuance of Securitization Bonds and conducting activities incidental thereto The Securitization Bonds are repaid through charges imposed on customers in Houston Electrics service territory For further discussion of the Securitization Bonds and the outstanding balances as of December 31 2018 and 2017  see Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements Customers Houston Electric serves nearly all of the HoustonGalveston metropolitan area At December 31 2018  Houston Electrics customers consisted of approximately 65 REPs which sell electricity to approximately 25 million metered customers in Houston 4 Electrics certificated service area and municipalities electric cooperatives and other distribution companies located outside Houston Electrics certificated service area Each REP is licensed by and must meet minimum creditworthiness criteria established by the PUCT Houston Electric does not have longterm contracts with any of its customers It operates using a continuous billing cycle with meter readings being conducted and invoices being distributed to REPs each business day For information regarding Houston Electrics major customers see Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements The table below reflects the number of metered customers in Houston Electrics service area as of December 31 2018  Residential Commercial Industrial Total Customers Texas Gulf Coast 2198225 287145

system events through the ADMS The Smart Grid continues to improve electric distribution service reliability and restoration enhance the consumer experience support the growth of renewable energy and help the environment by reducing carbon emissions Competition There are no other electric transmission and distribution utilities in Houston Electrics service area For another provider of transmission and distribution services to provide such services in Houston Electrics territory it would be required to obtain a certificate of convenience and necessity from the PUCT and depending on the location of the facilities may also be required to obtain franchises from one or more municipalities Houston Electric is not aware of any other party intending to enter this business in its service area at this time Distributed generation ie power generation located at or near the point of consumption could result in a reduction of demand for Houston Electrics distribution services but has not been a significant factor to date Seasonality Houston Electrics revenues are primarily derived from rates that it collects from each REP based on the amount of electricity it delivers on behalf of that REP Houston Electrics revenues and results of operations are subject to seasonality weather conditions and other changes in electricity usage with revenues generally being higher during the warmer months when more electricity is used for cooling purposes Properties All of Houston Electrics properties are located in Texas Its properties consist primarily of highvoltage electric transmission lines and poles distribution lines substations service centers service wires telecommunications network and meters Most of Houston Electrics transmission and distribution lines have been constructed over lands of others pursuant to easements or along public highways and streets under franchise agreements and as permitted by law All real and tangible properties of Houston Electric subject to certain exclusions are currently subject to  the lien of a Mortgage and Deed of Trust the Mortgage dated November 1 1944 as supplemented and  the lien of a General Mortgage the General Mortgage dated October 10 2002 as supplemented which is junior to the lien of the Mortgage For information related to debt outstanding under the Mortgage and General Mortgage see Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements 5 Electric Lines  Transmission and Distribution As of December 31 2018  Houston Electric owned and operated the following electric transmission and distribution lines Circuit Miles Description Overhead Lines Underground Lines Transmission lines  69 kV 266 2 Transmission lines  138 kV 2207 24 Transmission lines  345 kV 1336  Total transmission lines 3809 26 Distribution lines

December 31 2018  Houston Electric operated 15 regional service centers located on a total of 332 acres of land These service centers consist of office buildings warehouses and repair facilities that are used in the business of transmitting and distributing electricity Franchises Houston Electric holds nonexclusive franchises from certain incorporated municipalities in its service territory In exchange for the payment of fees these franchises give Houston Electric the right to use the streets and public rightsofway of these municipalities to construct operate and maintain its transmission and distribution system and to use that system to conduct its electric delivery business and for other purposes that the franchises permit The terms of the franchises with various expiration dates typically range from 20 to 40 years Natural Gas Distribution CenterPoint Energy and CERC CERCs NGD engages in regulated intrastate natural gas sales to and natural gas transportation and storage for approximately 35 million residential commercial industrial and transportation customers in Arkansas Louisiana Minnesota Mississippi Oklahoma and Texas The largest metropolitan areas served in each state by CERCs NGD are Houston Texas Minneapolis Minnesota Little Rock Arkansas Shreveport Louisiana Biloxi Mississippi and Lawton Oklahoma CERCs NGD also provides unregulated services in Minnesota consisting of residential appliance repair and maintenance services along with HVAC equipment sales CERCs NGDs service territory as of December 31 2018 is depicted below 6 Customers In 2018  approximately 40 of CERCs NGDs total throughput was to residential customers and approximately 60 was to commercial and industrial and transportation customers The table below reflects the number of CERCs NGD customers by state as of December 31 2018  Residential Commercial Industrial Total Customers Arkansas 377290 47963 425253 Louisiana 230234 16648 246882 Minnesota 797907 70604 868511

natural gas sales and transportation for commercial and industrial customers is seasonal In 2018  approximately 68 of CERCs NGDs total throughput occurred in the first and fourth quarters These patterns reflect the higher demand for natural gas for heating purposes during the colder months Supply and Transportation In 2018  CERCs NGD purchased virtually all of its natural gas supply pursuant to contracts with remaining terms varying from a few months to four years Major suppliers in 2018 included the following Supplier Percent of Supply Volumes Tenaska Marketing Ventures 185 Macquarie Energy LLC 131 BP Energy CompanyBP Canada Energy Marketing 103 Sequent Energy Management LP 76 Kinder Morgan Tejas PipelineKinder Morgan Texas Pipeline 56 Mieco Inc 54 Spire Marketing Inc 34 United Energy Trading LLC 31 CIMA Energy LTD 30 Koch Energy Services LLC 26 Numerous other suppliers provided the remaining 274 of CERCs NGDs natural gas supply requirements CERCs NGD transports its natural gas supplies through various intrastate and interstate pipelines under contracts with remaining terms including extensions varying from one to fifteen years CERCs NGD anticipates that these gas supply and transportation contracts will be renewed or replaced prior to their expiration CERCs NGD actively engages in commodity price stabilization pursuant to annual gas supply plans presented to andor filed with each of its state regulatory authorities These price stabilization activities include use of storage gas and contractually establishing structured prices eg fixed price costless collars and caps with CERCs NGDs physical gas suppliers Its gas supply plans generally call for 5075 of winter supplies to be stabilized in some fashion The regulations of the states in which CERCs NGD operates allow it to pass through changes in the cost of natural gas including savings and costs of financial derivatives associated with the indexpriced physical supply to its customers under purchased gas adjustment provisions in its tariffs Depending upon the jurisdiction the purchased gas adjustment factors are updated periodically ranging from monthly to semiannually The changes in the cost of gas billed to customers are subject to review by the applicable regulatory bodies 7 CERCs NGD uses various thirdparty storage services or owned natural gas storage facilities to meet peakday requirements and to manage the daily changes in demand due to changes in weather CERCs NGD may also supplement contracted supplies and storage from time to time with stored LNG and propaneair plant production CERCs NGD owns and operates an underground natural gas storage facility with a capacity of 70 Bcf It has a working capacity of 20 Bcf available for use during the heating season and a maximum daily withdrawal rate of 50 MMcf It also owns eight propaneair plants with a total production rate of 180000 Dth per day and onsite storage facilities for 12 million gallons of propane 10 Bcf natural gas equivalent It owns a LNG plant facility with a 12 milliongallon LNG storage tank 10 Bcf natural gas equivalent and a production rate of 72000 Dth per day On an ongoing basis CERCs NGD enters into contracts to provide sufficient supplies and pipeline capacity to meet its customer requirements However it is possible for limited service disruptions to occur from time to time due to weather conditions transportation constraints and other events As a result of these factors supplies of natural gas may become unavailable from time to time or prices may increase rapidly in response to temporary supply constraints or other factors CERCs NGD has AMAs associated with its utility distribution service in Arkansas Louisiana Mississippi Oklahoma and Texas In March 2018 CERCs NGDs thirdparty AMAs in Arkansas Louisiana and Oklahoma expired and CERCs NGD entered into new AMAs with CES effective April 1 2018 in these states The AMAs have varying terms the longest of which expires in 2021 Pursuant to the provisions of the agreements CERCs NGD sells natural gas and agrees to repurchase an equivalent amount of natural gas during the winter heating seasons at the same cost Generally AMAs are contracts between CERCs NGD and an asset manager that are intended to transfer the working capital obligation and maximize the utilization of the assets In these agreements CERCs NGD agrees to release transportation and storage capacity to other parties to manage natural gas storage supply and delivery arrangements for CERCs NGD and to use the released capacity for other purposes when it is not needed for CERCs NGD CERCs NGD is compensated by the asset manager through payments made over the life of the AMAs CERCs NGD has an obligation to purchase its winter storage requirements that have been released to the asset manager under these AMAs Assets As of December 31 2018  CERCs NGD owned approximately 76000 linear miles of natural gas distribution mains varying in size from onehalf inch to 24 inches in diameter Generally in each of the cities towns and rural areas served by CERCs NGD it owns the underground gas mains and service lines metering and regulating equipment located on customers premises and the district regulating equipment necessary for pressure maintenance With a few exceptions the measuring stations at which CERCs NGD receives gas are owned operated and maintained by others and its distribution facilities begin at the outlet of the measuring equipment These facilities including odorizing equipment are usually located on land owned by suppliers Competition CERCs NGD competes primarily with alternate energy sources such as electricity and other fuel sources In some areas intrastate pipelines other gas distributors and marketers also compete directly for gas sales to end users In addition as a result of federal regulations affecting interstate pipelines natural gas marketers operating on these pipelines may be able to bypass CERCs NGDs facilities and market and sell andor transport natural gas directly to commercial and industrial customers Energy Services CenterPoint Energy and CERC CERC offers competitive variable and fixedpriced physical natural gas supplies primarily to commercial and industrial customers and electric and natural gas utilities through CES and its subsidiary CEIP collectively Energy Services In 2018  CES marketed approximately 1355 Bcf of natural gas including approximately 33 Bcf to affiliates and provided related energy services and transportation to approximately 30000 customers in over 30 states CES customers vary in size from small commercial customers to large utility companies Not included in the 2018 customer count are approximately 65000 natural gas customers that are served under residential and small commercial choice programs invoiced by their host utility These customers are not included in customer count so as not to distort the significant margin impact from the remaining customer base 8 Energy Services service territory as of December 31 2018 is depicted below In 2017 CES completed the acquisition of AEM providing CES with a portfolio of industrial and large commercial customers complementary to CESs existing customer base and strategically aligned storage and transportation assets For further information related to this acquisition see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements CES offers a variety of natural gas management services to gas utilities large industrial customers electric generators smaller commercial and industrial customers municipalities educational institutions government facilities and hospitals These services include load forecasting supply acquisition daily swing volume management invoice consolidation storage asset management firm and interruptible transportation administration and forward price management CES also offers a portfolio of physical delivery services designed to meet customers supply and risk management needs These services include 1 through CEIP permanent pipeline connections through interconnects with various interstate and intrastate pipeline companies and 2 through MES temporary delivery of LNG and CNG throughout the lower 48 states utilizing a fleet of customized equipment to provide continuity of natural gas service when pipeline supply is not available In addition to offering natural gas management services CES procures and optimizes transportation and storage assets CES maintains a portfolio of natural gas supply contracts and firm transportation and storage agreements to meet the natural gas requirements of its customers CES aggregates supply from various producing regions and offers contracts to buy natural gas with terms ranging from one month to over five years In addition CES actively participates in the spot natural gas markets in an effort to balance daily and monthly purchases and sales obligations Natural gas supply and transportation capabilities are leveraged through contracts for ancillary services including physical storage and other balancing arrangements As described above CES offers its customers a variety of load following services In providing these services CES uses its customers purchase commitments to forecast and arrange its own supply purchases storage and transportation services to serve customers natural gas requirements As a result of the variance between this forecast activity and the actual monthly activity CES will either have too much supply or too little supply relative to its customers purchase commitments These supply imbalances arise each month as customers natural gas requirements are scheduled and corresponding natural gas supplies are nominated by CES for delivery to those customers CESs processes and risk control policy are designed to measure and value imbalances on a realtime basis to ensure that CESs exposure to commodity price risk is kept to a minimum The value assigned to these imbalances is calculated daily and is known as the aggregate VaR CenterPoint Energys and CERCs risk control policy which is overseen by CenterPoint Energys Risk Oversight Committee defines authorized and prohibited trading instruments and trading limits CES is a physical marketer of natural gas and uses a variety of tools including pipeline and storage capacity financial instruments and physical commodity purchase contracts to support its sales CES optimizes its use of these various tools to minimize its supply costs and does not engage in speculative commodity trading CES currently operates within a VaR limit set by CenterPoint Energys Board of Directors consistent with CES operational objective of matching its aggregate sales obligations including the swing associated with load following services 9 with its supply portfolio in a manner that minimizes its total cost of supply Should CES exceed this VaR limit management is required to notify CenterPoint Energys Board of Directors Assets As of December 31 2018  CEIP owned and operated over 200 miles of intrastate pipeline in Louisiana and Texas In addition CES leases transportation capacity on various interstate and intrastate pipelines and storage to service its shippers and end users Competition CES competes with regional and national wholesale and retail gas marketers including the marketing divisions of natural gas producers and utilities In addition CES competes with intrastate pipelines for customers and services in its market areas Midstream Investments CenterPoint Energy CenterPoint Energys

and local governmental agencies including the regulations described below The following discussion is based on regulation in the Registrants businesses and CenterPoint Energys investment in Enable as of December 31 2018 and does not include Vectrenrelated regulation Federal Energy Regulatory Commission The FERC has jurisdiction under the NGA and the NGPA as amended to regulate the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce and natural gas sales for resale in interstate commerce that are not first sales The FERC regulates among other things the construction of pipeline and related facilities used in the transportation and storage of natural gas in interstate commerce including the extension expansion or abandonment of these facilities The FERC has authority to prohibit market manipulation in connection with FERCregulated transactions to conduct audits and investigations and to impose significant civil penalties up to approximately 127 million per day per violation subject to periodic adjustment to account for inflation for statutory violations and violations of the FERCs rules or orders CenterPoint Energys and CERCs Energy Services reportable segment markets natural gas in interstate commerce pursuant to blanket authority granted by the FERC Houston Electric is not a public utility under the Federal Power Act and therefore is not generally regulated by the FERC although certain of its transactions are subject to limited FERC jurisdiction The FERC has certain responsibilities with respect 11 to ensuring the reliability of electric transmission service including transmission facilities owned by Houston Electric and other utilities within ERCOT The FERC has designated the NERC as the ERO to promulgate standards under FERC oversight for all owners operators and users of the bulk power system Electric Entities The ERO and the FERC have authority to a impose fines and other sanctions on Electric Entities that fail to comply with approved standards and b audit compliance with approved standards The FERC has approved the delegation by the NERC of authority for reliability in ERCOT to the Texas RE Houston Electric does not anticipate that the reliability standards proposed by the NERC and approved by the FERC will have a material adverse impact on its operations To the extent that Houston Electric is required to make additional expenditures to comply with these standards it is anticipated that Houston Electric will seek to recover those costs through the transmission charges that are imposed on all distribution service providers within ERCOT for electric transmission provided As a public utility holding company under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 CenterPoint Energy and its consolidated subsidiaries are subject to reporting and accounting requirements and are required to maintain certain books and records and make them available for review by the FERC and state regulatory authorities in certain circumstances State and Local Regulation  Electric Transmission  Distribution CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric Houston Electric conducts its operations pursuant to a certificate of convenience and necessity issued by the PUCT that covers its present service area and facilities The PUCT and certain municipalities have the authority to set the rates and terms of service provided by Houston Electric under costofservice rate regulation Houston Electric holds nonexclusive franchises from certain incorporated municipalities in its service territory In exchange for payment of fees these franchises give Houston Electric the right to use the streets and public rightsofway of these municipalities to construct operate and maintain its transmission and distribution system and to use that system to conduct its electric delivery business and for other purposes that the franchises permit The terms of the franchises with various expiration dates typically range from 20 to 40 years Houston Electrics distribution rates charged to REPs for residential and small commercial customers are primarily based on amounts of energy delivered whereas distribution rates for a majority of large commercial and industrial customers are primarily based on peak demand All REPs in Houston Electrics service area pay the same rates and other charges for transmission and distribution services This regulated delivery charge includes the transmission and distribution rate which includes municipal franchise fees a distribution recovery mechanism for recovery of incremental distributioninvested capital above that which is already reflected in the base distribution rate a nuclear decommissioning charge associated with decommissioning the South Texas nuclear generating facility an EECR charge and charges associated with securitization of regulatory assets stranded costs and restoration costs relating to Hurricane Ike Transmission rates charged to distribution companies are based on amounts of energy transmitted under postage stamp rates that do not vary with the distance the energy is being transmitted All distribution companies in ERCOT pay Houston Electric the same rates and other charges for transmission services For a discussion of certain of Houston Electrics ongoing regulatory proceedings see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Regulatory Matters in Item 7 of Part II of this report which discussion is incorporated herein by reference State and Local Regulation  Natural Gas Distribution CenterPoint Energy and CERC In almost all communities in which CERCs NGD provides natural gas distribution services NGD operates under franchises certificates or licenses obtained from state and local authorities The original terms of the franchises with various expiration dates typically range from 10 to 30 years although franchises in Arkansas are perpetual NGD expects to be able to renew expiring franchises In most cases franchises to provide natural gas utility services are not exclusive Substantially all of NGD is subject to costofservice rate regulation by the relevant state public utility commissions and in Texas by the Railroad Commission and those municipalities served by NGD that have retained original jurisdiction In certain of its jurisdictions NGD has annual rate adjustment mechanisms that provide for changes in rates dependent upon certain changes in invested capital earned returns on equity or actual margins realized For a discussion of certain of NGDs ongoing regulatory proceedings see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Regulatory Matters in Item 7 of Part II of this report which discussion is incorporated herein by reference 12 Department of Transportation CenterPoint Energy and CERC In December 2006 Congress enacted the 2006 Act which reauthorized the programs adopted under the 2002 Act These programs included several requirements related to ensuring pipeline safety and a requirement to assess the integrity of pipeline transmission facilities in areas of high population concentration Pursuant to the 2006 Act PHMSA an agency of the DOT issued regulations effective February 12 2010 requiring operators of gas distribution pipelines to develop and implement integrity management programs similar to those required for gas transmission pipelines but tailored to reflect the differences in distribution pipelines Operators of natural gas distribution systems were required to write and implement their integrity management programs by August 2 2011 CenterPoint Energys and CERCs natural gas distribution systems met this deadline Pursuant to the 2002 Act and the 2006 Act PHMSA has adopted a number of rules concerning among other things distinguishing between gathering lines and transmission facilities requiring certain design and construction features in new and replaced lines to reduce corrosion and requiring pipeline operators to amend existing written operations and maintenance procedures and operator qualification programs PHMSA also updated its reporting requirements for natural gas pipelines effective January 1 2011 In December 2011 Congress passed the 2011 Act This act increased the maximum civil penalties for pipeline safety administrative enforcement actions required the DOT to study and report on the expansion of integrity management requirements and the sufficiency of existing gathering line regulations to ensure safety required pipeline operators to verify their records on maximum allowable operating pressure and imposed new emergency response and incident notification requirements In 2016 the 2016 Act reauthorized PHMSAs pipeline safety programs through 2019 and provided limited new authority including the ability to issue emergency orders to set inspection requirements for certain underwater pipelines and to promulgate minimum safety standards for natural gas storage facilities as well as to provide increased transparency into the status of asyetincomplete PHMSA actions required by the 2011 Act CenterPoint Energy and CERC anticipate that compliance with PHMSAs regulations performance of the remediation activities by CenterPoint Energys and CERCs natural gas distribution companies and intrastate pipelines and verification of records on maximum allowable operating pressure will continue to require increases in both capital expenditures and operating costs The level of expenditures will depend upon several factors including age location and operating pressures of the facilities In particular the cost of compliance with the DOTs integrity management rules will depend on integrity testing and the repairs found to be necessary by such testing Changes to the amount of pipe subject to integrity management whether by expansion of the definition of the type of areas subject to integrity management procedures or of the applicability of such procedures outside of those defined areas may also affect the costs incurred Implementation of the 2011 and 2016 Acts by PHMSA may result in other regulations or the reinterpretation of existing regulations that could impact compliance costs In addition CenterPoint Energy and CERC may be subject to the DOTs enforcement actions and penalties if they fail to comply with pipeline regulations Midstream Investments  Rate and Other Regulation CenterPoint Energy Federal state and local regulation may affect certain aspects of Enables business Interstate Natural Gas Pipeline Regulation Enables interstate pipeline systemsEGT MRT and SESHare subject to regulation by the FERC and are considered natural gas companies under the NGA Under the NGA the rates for service on Enables interstate facilities must be just and reasonable and not unduly discriminatory Rate and tariff changes for these facilities can only be implemented upon approval by the FERC Enables interstate pipelines business operations may be affected by changes in the demand for natural gas the available supply and relative price of natural gas in the Midcontinent and Gulf Coast natural gas supply regions and general economic conditions Market Behavior Rules Posting and Reporting Requirements The EPAct of 2005 amended the NGA to add an antimanipulation provision that makes it unlawful for any entity to engage in prohibited behavior as prescribed in FERC rules which were subsequently issued in FERC Order No 670 The EPAct of 2005 also amends the NGA and the NGPA to give the FERC authority to impose civil penalties for violations of these statutes and FERCs regulations rules and orders of up to approximately 127 million per day per violation subject to periodic adjustment to account for inflation Should Enable fail to comply with all applicable FERCadministered statutes rules regulations and orders it could be subject to substantial penalties and fines In addition the CFTC is directed under the CEA to prevent price manipulations 13 for the commodity and futures markets including the energy futures markets Pursuant to the DoddFrank Act and other authority the CFTC has adopted antimarket manipulation regulations that prohibit fraud and price manipulation in the commodity and futures markets The CFTC also has statutory authority to seek civil penalties of up to the greater of 12 million or triple the monetary gain to the violator for violations of the antimarket manipulation sections of the CEA These maximum penalty levels are also subject to periodic adjustment to account for inflation Intrastate Natural Gas Pipeline and Storage Regulation Intrastate natural gas transportation is largely regulated by the state in which the transportation takes place However an intrastate natural gas pipeline system may transport natural gas in interstate commerce provided that the rates terms and conditions of such transportation service comply with Section 311 of the NGPA and Part 284 of the FERCs regulations Rates for service pursuant to Section 311 of the NGPA are generally subject to review and approval by the FERC at least once every five years Failure to observe the service limitations applicable to transportation services provided under Section 311 failure to comply with the rates approved by the FERC for Section 311 service or failure to comply with the terms and conditions of service established in the pipelines FERCapproved Statement of Operating Conditions could result in the assertion of federal NGA jurisdiction by the FERC andor the imposition of administrative civil and criminal penalties as described under Interstate Natural Gas Pipeline Regulation above Natural Gas Gathering and Processing Regulation Section 1b of the NGA exempts natural gas gathering facilities from the jurisdiction of the FERC Although the FERC has not made formal determinations with respect to all of the facilities Enable considers to be gathering facilities Enable believes that its natural gas pipelines meet the traditional tests that the FERC has used to determine that a pipeline is a gathering pipeline and is therefore not subject to FERC jurisdiction The distinction however has been the subject of substantial litigation and the FERC determines whether facilities are gathering facilities on a casebycase basis so the classification and regulation of Enables gathering facilities is subject to change based on future determinations States may regulate gathering pipelines State regulation generally includes various safety environmental and in some circumstances antidiscrimination requirements and in some instances complaintbased rate regulation Enables gathering operations may be subject to ratable take and common purchaser statutes in the states in which they operate Enables gathering operations could be adversely affected should they be subject in the future to the application of state or federal regulation of rates and services Enables gathering operations could also be subject to additional safety and operational regulations relating to the design construction testing operation replacement and maintenance of gathering facilities CenterPoint Energy cannot predict what effect if any such changes might have on Enables operations but the industry could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased costs depending on future legislative and regulatory changes Interstate Crude Oil Gathering Regulation Enables crude oil gathering systems in the Williston Basin transport crude oil in interstate commerce pursuant to a public tariff in accordance with FERC regulatory requirements Crude oil gathering pipelines that transport crude oil in interstate commerce may be regulated as common carriers by the FERC under the ICA the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and the rules and regulations promulgated under those laws The ICA and FERC regulations require that rates for interstate service pipelines that transport crude oil and refined petroleum products collectively referred to as petroleum pipelines and certain other liquids be just and reasonable and nondiscriminatory or not conferring any undue preference upon any shipper FERC regulations also require interstate common carrier petroleum pipelines to file with the FERC and publicly post tariffs stating their interstate transportation rates and terms and conditions of service Intrastate Crude Oil and Condensate Gathering Regulation Enables crude oil and condensate gathering system in the Anadarko Basin is located in Oklahoma and is subject to limited regulation by the OCC Crude oil and condensate gathering systems are common carriers under Oklahoma law and are prohibited from unjust or unlawful discrimination in favor of one customer over another Additional rules and legislation pertaining to these matters are considered or adopted from time to time Enables crude oil and condensate gathering operations could be adversely affected should they be subject in the future to the application of state or federal regulation of rates and services 14 Safety and Health Regulation Certain of Enables facilities are subject to pipeline safety regulations PHMSA regulates safety requirements in the design construction operation and maintenance of jurisdictional natural gas and hazardous liquid pipeline facilities All natural gas transmission facilities such as Enables interstate natural gas pipelines are subject to PHMSAs regulations but natural gas gathering pipelines are subject only to the extent they are classified as regulated gathering pipelines In addition several NGL pipeline facilities and crude oil pipeline facilities are regulated as hazardous liquids pipelines Pursuant to various federal statutes including the NGPSA the DOT through PHMSA regulates pipeline safety and integrity NGL and crude oil pipelines are subject to regulation by PHMSA under the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Act which requires PHMSA to develop prescribe and enforce minimum federal safety standards for the transportation of hazardous liquids by pipeline and comparable state statutes with respect to design installation testing construction operation replacement and management of pipeline facilities Should Enable fail to comply with DOT or comparable state regulations it could be subject to penalties and fines If future DOT pipeline regulations were to require that Enable expand its integrity management program to currently unregulated pipelines costs associated with compliance may have a material effect on its operations ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The following discussion is based on environmental matters in the Registrants businesses as of December 31 2018 and does not include Vectrenrelated environmental matters The Registrants operations and the operations of Enable are subject to stringent and complex laws and regulations pertaining to the environment As an owner or operator of natural gas pipelines distribution systems and storage electric transmission and distribution systems and the facilities that support these systems the Registrants must comply with these laws and regulations at the federal state and local levels These laws and regulations can restrict or impact the Registrants business activities in many ways including but not limited to  restricting the way the Registrants can handle or dispose of wastes  limiting or prohibiting construction activities in sensitive areas such as wetlands coastal regions or areas inhabited by endangered species  requiring remedial action and monitoring to mitigate environmental conditions caused by the Registrants operations or attributable to former operations  enjoining the operations of facilities with permits issued pursuant to such environmental laws and regulations and  impacting the demand for the Registrants services by directly or indirectly affecting the use or price of natural gas To comply with these requirements the Registrants may need to spend substantial amounts and devote other resources from time to time to among other activities  construct or acquire new facilities and equipment  acquire permits for facility operations  modify upgrade or replace existing and proposed equipment and  decommission or remediate waste management areas fuel storage facilities and other locations Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative civil and criminal enforcement measures including the assessment of monetary penalties the imposition of remedial actions and monitoring and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations Certain environmental statutes impose strict joint and several liability for costs required to assess clean up and restore sites where hazardous substances have been stored disposed or released Moreover it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury andor property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other waste products into the environment The recent trend in environmental regulation has been to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may impact the environment There can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation and monitoring and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts currently anticipated The 15 Registrants try to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and plan accordingly to maintain compliance with changing environmental laws and regulations Based on current regulatory requirements and interpretations the Registrants do not believe that compliance with federal state or local environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on their business financial position results of operations or cash flows In addition the Registrants believe that their current environmental remediation activities will not materially interrupt or diminish their operational ability The Registrants cannot assure you that future events such as changes in existing laws the promulgation of new laws or the development or discovery of new facts or conditions will not cause them to incur significant costs The following is a discussion of material current environmental and safety issues laws and regulations that relate to the Registrants operations The Registrants believe that they are in substantial compliance with these environmental laws and regulations Global Climate Change There is increasing attention being paid in the United States and worldwide to the issue of climate change As a result from time to time regulatory agencies have considered the modification of existing laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations addressing the emissions of GHG on the state federal or international level Some of the proposals would require industrial sources to meet stringent new standards that would require substantial reductions in GHG emissions CenterPoint Energys and CERCs revenues operating costs and capital requirements could be adversely affected as a result of any regulatory action that would require installation of new control technologies or a modification of their operations or would have the effect of reducing the consumption of natural gas Houston Electric in contrast to some electric utilities does not generate electricity and thus is not directly exposed to the risk of high capital costs and regulatory uncertainties that face electric utilities that burn fossil fuels to generate electricity Nevertheless CenterPoint Energys and Houston Electrics revenues could be adversely affected to the extent any resulting regulatory action has the effect of reducing consumption of electricity by ultimate consumers within Houston Electrics service territory Likewise incentives to conserve energy or to use energy sources other than natural gas could result in a decrease in demand for the Registrants services Conversely regulatory actions that effectively promote the consumption of natural gas because of its lower emissions characteristics would be expected to beneficially affect CenterPoint Energy and CERC and their natural gasrelated businesses At this point in time however it would be speculative to try to quantify the magnitude of the impacts from possible new regulatory actions related to GHG emissions either positive or negative on the Registrants businesses To the extent climate changes may occur and such climate changes result in warmer temperatures in the Registrants or Enables service territories financial results from the Registrants and Enables businesses could be adversely impacted For example CenterPoint Energys and CERCs NGD could be adversely affected through lower natural gas sales and Enables natural gas gathering processing and transportation and crude oil gathering businesses could experience lower revenues On the other hand warmer temperatures in CenterPoint Energys and Houston Electrics electric service territory may increase revenues from transmission and distribution through increased demand for electricity for cooling Another possible result of climate change is more frequent and more severe weather events such as hurricanes or tornadoes Since many of the Registrants facilities are located along or near the Gulf Coast increased or more severe hurricanes or tornadoes could increase costs to repair damaged facilities and restore service to customers When the Registrants cannot deliver electricity or natural gas to customers or customers cannot receive services the Registrants financial results can be impacted by lost revenues and they generally must seek approval from regulators to recover restoration costs To the extent the Registrants are unable to recover those costs or if higher rates resulting from recovery of such costs result in reduced demand for services the Registrants future financial results may be adversely impacted Air Emissions The Registrants operations are subject to the federal Clean Air Act and comparable state laws and regulations These laws and regulations regulate emissions of air pollutants from various industrial sources including processing plants and compressor stations and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements Such laws and regulations may require preapproval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce air emissions or result in the increase of existing air emissions The Registrants may be required to obtain and strictly comply with air permits containing various emissions and operational limitations or utilize specific emission control technologies to limit emissions Failure to comply with these requirements could result in monetary penalties injunctions conditions or restrictions on operations and potentially criminal enforcement actions The Registrants may be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment in connection with obtaining and maintaining operating permits and approvals for air emissions The EPA has established new air emission control requirements for natural gas and NGLs production processing and transportation activities Under the NESHAPS the EPA established the RICE MACT rule Compressors and back up electrical 16 generators used by CenterPoint Energys and CERCs NGD and back up electrical generators used by CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric are substantially compliant with these laws and regulations Water Discharges The Registrants operations are subject to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 as amended also known as the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws and regulations These laws and regulations impose detailed requirements and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into waters of the United States The unpermitted discharge of pollutants including discharges resulting from a spill or leak incident is prohibited The Clean Water Act and regulations implemented thereunder also prohibit discharges of dredged and fill material into wetlands and other waters of the United States unless authorized by an appropriately issued permit Any unpermitted release of petroleum or other pollutants from the Registrants pipelines or facilities could result in fines or penalties as well as significant remedial obligations Under the Obama administration the EPA promulgated a set of rules that included a comprehensive regulatory overhaul of defining waters of the United States for the purposes of determining federal jurisdiction As initially promulgated these regulations would expand federal jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act and therefore have the potential to affect many aspects of the Registrants waterrelated regulatory compliance obligations However the new rules were challenged in court and the US Supreme Court has recently held that any challenge to the rules must be brought in the US district courts rather than directly before the US courts of appeals As a result the new definition of the waters of the United States is likely to be disputed in litigation for years to come Additionally the Trump administration has signaled its intent to repeal and replace the Obamaera rules In accordance with this intent the EPA promulgated a rule in early 2018 that postponed the effectiveness of the Obamaera rules until 2020 Thereafter the EPA proposed a new set of rules that would narrow the Clean Water Acts jurisdiction Thus the fate and content of the regulations defining waters of the United States is currently uncertain and it is not clear when and even if they will be enacted The potential impact of any new waters of the United States regulations on the Registrants business liabilities compliance obligations or profits and revenues is uncertain at this time Hazardous Waste The Registrants operations generate wastes including some hazardous wastes that are subject to the federal RCRA and comparable state laws which impose detailed requirements for the handling storage treatment transport and disposal of hazardous and solid waste RCRA currently exempts many natural gas gathering and field processing wastes from classification as hazardous waste Specifically RCRA excludes from the definition of hazardous waste waters produced and other wastes associated with the exploration development or production of crude oil and natural gas However these oil and gas exploration and production wastes are still regulated under state law and the less stringent nonhazardous waste requirements of RCRA Moreover ordinary industrial wastes such as paint wastes waste solvents laboratory wastes and waste compressor oils may be regulated as hazardous waste The transportation of natural gas in pipelines may also generate some hazardous wastes that would be subject to RCRA or comparable state law requirements Liability for Remediation CERCLA also known as Superfund and comparable state laws impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons responsible for the release of hazardous substances into the environment Classes of PRPs include the current and past owners or operators of sites where a hazardous substance was released and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances at offsite locations such as landfills Although petroleum as well as natural gas is expressly excluded from CERCLAs definition of a hazardous substance in the course of the Registrants ordinary operations they do from time to time generate wastes that may fall within the definition of a hazardous substance CERCLA authorizes the EPA and in some cases third parties to take action in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to recover the costs they incur from the responsible classes of persons Under CERCLA the Registrants could potentially be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up and restoring sites where hazardous substances have been released for damages to natural resources and for associated response and assessment costs including for the costs of certain health studies Liability for Preexisting Conditions For information about preexisting environmental matters please

Trustees for Northwest Assistance Ministries of Houston Item 1A Risk Factors CenterPoint Energy is a holding company that conducts all of its business operations through subsidiaries primarily Houston Electric CERC and as of February 1 2019 Vectren through its operating subsidiaries CenterPoint Energy also owns interests in Enable The following along with any additional legal proceedings identified or incorporated by reference in Item 3 of this combined report on Form 10K summarizes the principal risk factors associated with the holding company the businesses conducted by its subsidiaries including Vectren and its interests in Enable However additional risks and uncertainties either not presently known or not currently believed by management to be material may also adversely affect CenterPoint Energys businesses Carefully consider each of the risks described below relating to Houston Electric and CERC which along with CenterPoint Energy including Vectren for purposes of this Item 1A only are collectively referred to as the Registrants Unless the context indicates otherwise where appropriate information relating to a specific registrant has been segregated and labeled as such and specific references to Houston Electric and CERC in this section also pertain to CenterPoint Energy In this combined report on Form 10K the terms our we and us are used as abbreviated references to CenterPoint Energy Inc together with its subsidiaries which as of February 1 2019 includes Vectren and its subsidiaries 19 Risk Factors Associated with Our Consolidated Financial Condition CenterPoint Energy is a holding company with no operations or operating assets of its own As a result CenterPoint Energy depends on the performance of and distributions from its subsidiaries and from Enable to meet its payment obligations and to pay dividends on its common and preferred stock and provisions of applicable law or contractual restrictions could limit the amount of those distributions CenterPoint Energy derives all of its operating income from and holds all of its assets through its subsidiaries including its interests in Enable As a result CenterPoint Energy depends on distributions from its subsidiaries and Enable to meet its payment obligations and to pay dividends on its common and preferred stock In general CenterPoint Energys subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to provide it with funds for its payment obligations whether by dividends distributions loans or otherwise In addition provisions of applicable law such as those limiting the legal sources of dividends limit CenterPoint Energys subsidiaries and Enables ability to make payments or other distributions to CenterPoint Energy and its subsidiaries or Enable could agree to contractual restrictions on their ability to make distributions Additionally CenterPoint Energys results of operations future growth and earnings and dividend goals will depend on the performance of its utility and nonutility such as CES Infrastructure Services and ESG subsidiaries which contribute to a portion of its consolidated earnings and which may not perform at expected or forecasted levels or do not achieve the projected growth in these businesses as anticipated CenterPoint Energy and CERC also offer home repair protection plans to natural gas customers in Texas through a thirdparty provider and provide home appliance maintenance and repair services to customers in Minnesota For a discussion of risks that may impact the amount of cash distributions CenterPoint Energy receives with respect to its interests in Enable please read  Additional Risk Factors Affecting CenterPoint Energys Interests in Enable Midstream Partners LP  CenterPoint Energys cash flows will be adversely impacted if it receives less cash distributions from Enable than it currently expects CenterPoint Energys right to receive any assets of any subsidiary and therefore the right of its creditors to participate in those assets will be structurally subordinated to the claims of that subsidiarys creditors including trade creditors In addition even if CenterPoint Energy were a creditor of any subsidiary its rights as a creditor would be effectively subordinated to any security interest in the assets of that subsidiary and any indebtedness of the subsidiary senior to that held by CenterPoint Energy If we are unable to arrange future financings on acceptable terms our ability to finance our capital expenditures or refinance outstanding indebtedness could be limited Our businesses are capital intensive and we rely on various sources to finance our capital expenditures For example we depend on i longterm debt ii borrowings through our revolving credit facilities and for CenterPoint Energy and CERC commercial paper programs iii distributions from CenterPoint Energys interests in Enable CenterPoint Energy may also depend on the net proceeds from a sale of a portion of Enable common units it owns and iv if market conditions permit issuances of additional shares of common andor preferred stock by CenterPoint Energy We may also use such sources to refinance any outstanding indebtedness as it matures As of December 31 2018 CenterPoint Energy had 92 billion of outstanding indebtedness on a consolidated basis which includes 14 billion of nonrecourse Securitization Bonds For information on maturities through 2023 see Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements As of December 31 2018 Vectren and its subsidiaries had outstanding 167 million of shortterm debt and 22 billion of longterm debt including current maturities Our future financing activities may be significantly affected by among other things  general economic and capital market conditions  credit availability from financial institutions and other lenders  volatility or fluctuations in distributions from Enables units or volatility in Enables unit price  investor confidence in us and the markets in which we operate  the future performance of our and Enables businesses  integration of Vectrens businesses into CenterPoint Energy  maintenance of acceptable credit ratings  market expectations regarding our future earnings and cash flows  our ability to access capital markets on reasonable terms 20  incremental collateral that may be required due to regulation of derivatives and  provisions of relevant tax and securities laws As of December 31 2018 Houston Electric had approximately 33 billion aggregate principal amount of general mortgage bonds outstanding under the General Mortgage including approximately 68 million held in trust to secure pollution control bonds for which CenterPoint Energy is obligated Additionally as of December 31 2018 Houston Electric had approximately 102 million aggregate principal amount of first mortgage bonds outstanding under the Mortgage Houston Electric may issue additional general mortgage bonds on the basis of retired bonds up to 70 of property additions or cash deposited with the trustee As of December 31 2018 approximately 43 billion of additional first mortgage bonds and general mortgage bonds in the aggregate could be issued on the basis of retired bonds and 70 of property additions as of December 31 2018 However Houston Electric has contractually agreed that it will not issue additional first mortgage bonds subject to certain exceptions In January 2019 Houston Electric issued 700 million aggregate principal amount of general mortgage bonds As of December 31 2018 Indiana Electric had approximately 293 million aggregate principal amount of first mortgage bonds outstanding Indiana Electric may issue additional bonds under its Mortgage Indenture up to 60 of currently unfunded property additions As of December 31 2018 approximately 10 billion of additional first mortgage bonds could be issued on this basis However under certain circumstances Indiana Electric is limited in its ability to issue additional bonds under the Mortgage Indenture due to a provision in its parents VUHI indentures The Registrants current credit ratings are discussed in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Other Matters  Impact on Liquidity of a Downgrade in Credit Ratings in Item 7 of Part II of this report These credit ratings may not remain in effect for any given period of time and one or more of these ratings may be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency On January 28 2019 in anticipation of the closing of the Merger Moodys downgraded the longterm credit ratings of CenterPoint Energy including its issuer rating to Baa2 from Baa1 senior unsecured debt rating to Baa2 from Baa1 subordinated debt rating to Baa3 from Baa2 and preferred stock rating to Ba1 from Baa3 while affirming its Prime2 shortterm rating for commercial paper and A1 senior secured revenue bonds Moodys also changed the rating outlook for CenterPoint Energy to stable from negative On February 1 2019 as a result of the closing of the Merger SP lowered its issuer credit rating on CenterPoint Energy to BBB from A and lowered the credit ratings for CenterPoint Energys senior unsecured and subordinated notes to BBB from BBB and the Series A Preferred Stock to BBB from BBB SP also removed the CenterPoint Energy ratings from CreditWatch where SP had previously placed them with negative implications as a result of the announcement of the Merger in the second quarter of 2018 and changed its outlook to stable SP also lowered its issuer credit ratings on Houston Electric and CERC to BBB from A SP affirmed the A credit rating on Houston Electrics first mortgage bonds and general mortgage bonds and lowered the credit rating on CERCs senior unsecured debt to BBB from A SP also removed the Houston Electric and CERC ratings from CreditWatch where SP had previously placed them with negative implications as a result of the announcement of the Merger in the second quarter of 2018 and changed its outlook to stable SP also affirmed the A2 shortterm and commercial paper ratings for CenterPoint Energy and CERC The Registrants note that these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy sell or hold their securities Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating Any future reduction or withdrawal of one or more of the Registrants credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on their ability to access capital on acceptable terms An impairment of goodwill longlived assets including intangible assets equity method investments and an impairment or fair value adjustment to CenterPoint Energys Enable Series A Preferred Unit investment could reduce our earnings Goodwill is recorded when the purchase price of a business exceeds the fair market value of the tangible and separately measurable intangible net assets Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require CenterPoint Energy to test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or when events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill might be impaired Longlived assets including intangible assets with finite useful lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable For investments CenterPoint Energy accounts for under the equity method the impairment test considers whether the fair value of such investment as a whole not the underlying net assets has declined and whether that decline is other than temporary For example if Enables common unit price distributions or earnings were to decline and that decline is deemed to be other than temporary CenterPoint Energy could determine that it is unable to recover the carrying value of its equity investment in Enable Considerable judgment is used in determining if an impairment loss is other than temporary and the amount of any impairment A sustained low Enable common unit price could result in CenterPoint Energy recording impairment charges in the future For investments CenterPoint Energy accounts for as investments without a readily determinable fair value such as the Enable Series A Preferred Unit investment the carrying value of the asset may be adjusted to fair value resulting in a gain or loss in the 21 period if a transaction on an identical or similar investment in Enable is observed Additionally CenterPoint Energy considers qualitative impairment triggers such as significant deterioration in earnings performance significant decline in market condition and other factors that raise significant concerns about Enables ability to continue as a going concern to determine if an impairment analysis should be performed on its investment Further as a result of the Merger CenterPoint Energy will have a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets on its consolidated financial statements that are subject to impairment based on future adverse changes to its business or prospects Should the annual impairment test or another periodic impairment test or an observable transaction as described above indicate the fair value of our assets is less than the carrying value we would be required to take a noncash charge to earnings with a correlative effect on equity and balance sheet leverage as measured by debt to total capitalization A noncash impairment charge or fair value adjustment could materially adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition Changing demographics poor investment performance of pension plan assets and other factors adversely affecting the calculation of pension liabilities could unfavorably impact our results of operations liquidity and financial position CenterPoint Energy and its subsidiaries maintain qualified defined benefit pension plans covering certain of its employees Costs associated with these plans are dependent upon a number of factors including the investment returns on plan assets the level of interest rates used to calculate the funded status of the plan contributions to the plan and government regulations with respect to funding requirements and the calculation of plan liabilities Funding requirements may increase and CenterPoint Energy may be required to make unplanned contributions in the event of a decline in the market value of plan assets a decline in the interest rates used to calculate the present value of future plan obligations or government regulations that increase minimum funding requirements or the pension liability In addition to affecting CenterPoint Energys funding requirements each of these factors could adversely affect our results of operations liquidity and financial position Vectren also contributes to several multiemployer pension plans for Infrastructure Services If Infrastructure Services withdraws from these plans CenterPoint Energy may be required to pay an amount based on the allocable share of the plans unfunded vested benefits referred to as the withdrawal liability This could adversely affect our results of operations liquidity and financial position The costs of providing health care benefits to our employees and retirees may increase substantially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition We provide health care benefits to eligible employees and retirees through selfinsured plans In recent years the costs of providing these benefits per beneficiary increased due to higher health care costs and higher levels of large individual health care claims and overall health care claims We anticipate that such costs will continue to rise Further the effects of health care reform or any future legislative changes could also materially affect our health care benefit programs and costs Any potential changes and resulting cost impacts which are likely to be passed on to us cannot be determined with certainty at this time Our costs of providing these benefits could also increase materially in the future should there be a material reduction in the amount of the recovery of these costs through our rates or should significant delays develop in the timing of the recovery of such costs which could adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity The use of derivative contracts in the normal course of business by the Registrants or Enable could result in financial losses that could negatively impact the Registrants results of operations and those of Enable The Registrants use derivative instruments such as swaps options futures and forwards to manage commodity weather and financial market risks Enable may also use such instruments from time to time to manage its commodity and financial market risks The Registrants or Enable could recognize financial losses as a result of volatility in the market values or ineffectiveness of these contracts or should a counterparty fail to perform Additionally in the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources the valuation of these financial instruments can involve managements judgment or use of estimates As a result changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these contracts If CenterPoint Energy redeems the ZENS prior to their maturity in 2029 its ultimate tax liability and redemption payments would result in significant cash payments which would adversely impact its cash flows Similarly a significant amount of exchanges of ZENS by ZENS holders could adversely impact CenterPoint Energys cash flows CenterPoint Energy has approximately 828 million principal amount of ZENS outstanding as of December 31 2018 CenterPoint Energy owns shares of ZENSRelated Securities equal to approximately 100 of the reference shares used to calculate 22 its obligation to the holders of the ZENS CenterPoint Energy may redeem all of the ZENS at any time at a redemption amount per ZENS equal to the higher of the contingent principal amount per ZENS 93 million in the aggregate or 657 per ZENS as of December 31 2018 or the sum of the current market value of the reference shares attributable to one ZENS at the time of redemption In the event CenterPoint Energy redeems the ZENS in addition to the redemption amount it would be required to pay deferred taxes related to the ZENS CenterPoint Energys ultimate tax liability related to the ZENS continues to increase by the amount of the tax benefit realized each year If the ZENS had been redeemed on December 31 2018 deferred taxes of approximately 438 million would have been payable in 2018 based on 2018 tax rates in effect In addition if all the shares of ZENSRelated Securities had been sold on December 31 2018 to fund the aggregate redemption amount capital gains taxes of approximately 90 million would have been payable in 2018 Similarly a significant amount of exchanges of ZENS by ZENS holders could adversely impact CenterPoint Energys cash flows This could happen if CenterPoint Energys creditworthiness were to drop or the market for the ZENS were to become illiquid or for some other reason While funds for the payment of cash upon exchange of ZENS could be obtained from the sale of the shares of ZENSRelated Securities that CenterPoint Energy owns or from other sources ZENS exchanges result in a cash outflow because tax deferrals related to the ZENS and ZENSRelated Securities shares would typically cease when ZENS are exchanged and ZENSRelated Securities shares are sold Dividend requirements associated with the Series A Preferred Stock and the Series B Preferred Stock that CenterPoint Energy issued to fund a portion of the Merger subject it to certain risks In August 2018 CenterPoint Energy issued 800000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock In October 2018 CenterPoint Energy issued 19550000 depositary shares each representing a 120th interest in a share of CenterPoint Energys Series B Preferred Stock Any future payments of cash dividends and the amount of any cash dividends CenterPoint Energy pays on the Series A Preferred Stock and the Series B Preferred Stock will depend on among other things its financial condition capital requirements and results of operations and the ability of our subsidiaries and Enable to distribute cash to CenterPoint Energy as well as other factors that CenterPoint Energys Board of Directors or an authorized committee thereof may consider relevant Any failure to pay scheduled dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock and the Series B Preferred Stock when due would likely have a material adverse impact on the market price of the Series A Preferred Stock the Series B Preferred Stock Common Stock and CenterPoint Energys debt securities and would prohibit CenterPoint Energy under the terms of the Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock from paying cash dividends on or repurchasing shares of Common Stock subject to limited exceptions until such time as CenterPoint Energy has paid all accumulated and unpaid dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock and the Series B Preferred Stock The terms of the Series A Preferred Stock and the Series B Preferred Stock further provide that if dividends on any of the respective shares have not been declared and paid for the equivalent of three or more semiannual or six or more quarterly dividend periods whether or not for consecutive dividend periods the holders of such shares voting together as a single class with holders of any and all other series of CenterPoint Energys capital stock on parity with its Series A Preferred Stock or its Series B Preferred Stock as to the payment of dividends and amounts payable on liquidation dissolution or winding up of CenterPoint Energys affairs upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable will be entitled to vote for the election of a total of two additional members of CenterPoint Energys Board of Directors subject to certain terms and limitations Risk Factors Affecting Electric Generation Transmission and Distribution Businesses CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric Rate regulation of Houston Electrics and Indiana Electrics businesses may delay or deny their ability to earn an expected return and fully recover their costs Houston Electrics rates are regulated by certain municipalities and the PUCT and Indiana Electrics rates are regulated by the IURC Their rates are set in comprehensive base rate proceedings ie general rate cases based on an analysis of their invested capital their expenses and other factors in a designated test year Each of these rate proceedings is subject to thirdparty intervention and appeal and the timing of a general base rate proceeding may be out of Houston Electrics and Indiana Electrics control For Houston Electric a general base rate proceeding is required 48 months from the date of the last general base rate change unless the PUCT issues an order extending the deadline to file that general base rate proceeding In connection with the PUCTs review of the impacts of the TCJA on February 13 2018 Houston Electric and other likely parties to a future rate case announced a settlement that among other things requires Houston Electric to make a general rate case filing by April 30 2019 There is no guarantee that current rates will continue or that the general rate case will result in rates that fully recover Houston Electrics costs or enable it to earn a reasonable return on its invested capital The rates that Houston Electric and Indiana Electric are allowed to charge may not match their costs at any given time a situation referred to as regulatory lag For Houston Electric and Indiana Electric though several interim rate adjustment mechanisms have been implemented to reduce the effects of regulatory lag these adjustment mechanisms are subject to the 23 applicable regulatory bodys approval and are subject to limitations that may reduce Houston Electrics and Indiana Electrics ability to adjust rates For example for Houston Electric the DCRF mechanism adjusts an electric utilitys rates for increases in net distributioninvested capital eg distribution plant and distributionrelated intangible plant and communication equipment since its last comprehensive base rate proceeding but Houston Electric may only make a DCRF filing once per calendar year and not during a comprehensive base rate proceeding The TCOS mechanism allows a transmission service provider to update its wholesale transmission rates to reflect changes in transmissionrelated invested capital but is only available to Houston Electric twice per calendar year However neither of these mechanisms provides for recovery of operations and maintenance expenses Similarly for Indiana Electric the TDSIC rate mechanism allows electric utilities that have an IURCapproved sevenyear infrastructure improvement plan to request incremental rate increases every six months to pay for the projects included in that plan subject to IURC approval However the TDSIC allows the utility to recover 80 of the cost as they are incurred with the remaining costs to be deferred as regulatory assets until the next base rate case and rate increases are limited to no more than 2 of the utilitys total retail revenues from the prior year Indiana Electric recovers transmission costs through a FERCapproved formula rate and reflects charges and costs associated with participation in MISO through the Reliability Cost and Revenue Adjustment and MISO Cost and Recovery Adjustment mechanisms which are filed annually With respect to the DSMA electricity suppliers are required to submit energy efficiency plans to the IURC at least once every three years and may file under the DSMA mechanism annually to recover program and administrative costs including lost revenues and financial incentives The DSMA is subject to IURC approval Houston Electric and Indiana Electric can make no assurance that filings for such mechanisms will result in favorable adjustments to rates or in full cost recovery Notwithstanding the application of the rate mechanisms discussed above the regulatory process by which rates are determined is subject to change as a result of the legislative process or rulemaking as the case may be and may not always be available or result in rates that will produce recovery of Houston Electrics and Indiana Electrics costs or enable them to earn an expected return In addition changes to the interim adjustment mechanisms could result in an increase in regulatory lag or otherwise impact Houston Electrics and Indiana Electrics ability to recover their costs in a timely manner Additionally inherent in the regulatory process is some level of risk that jurisdictional regulatory authorities may initiate investigations of the prudence of operating expenses incurred or capital investments made by Houston Electric or Indiana Electric and deny the full recovery of their cost of service in rates To the extent the regulatory process does not allow Houston Electric and Indiana Electric to make a full and timely recovery of appropriate costs their results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected Unlike Houston Electric Indiana Electric must seek approval by the IURC for longterm financing authority This authority allows Indiana Electric the flexibility to issue debt securities among other financing arrangements In the event that the IURC does not approve Indiana Electrics financing authority Indiana Electric may not be able to fully execute its financing plans and its financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected Disruptions at power generation facilities owned by third parties could interrupt Houston Electrics sales of transmission and distribution services Houston Electric transmits and distributes to customers of REPs electric power that the REPs obtain from power generation facilities owned by third parties Houston Electric does not own or operate any power generation facilities If power generation is disrupted or if power generation capacity is inadequate Houston Electrics sales of transmission and distribution services may be diminished or interrupted and its results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected Houston Electrics and Indiana Electrics revenues and results of operations are seasonal A significant portion of Houston Electrics revenues is derived from rates that it collects from each REP based on the amount of electricity it delivers on behalf of such REP Similarly Indiana Electrics revenues are derived from rates it charges its customers to provide electricity Thus Houston Electrics and Indiana Electrics revenues and results of operations are subject to seasonality weather conditions and other changes in electricity usage Houston Electrics revenues are generally higher during the warmer months Unusually mild weather in the warmer months could diminish Houston Electrics results of operations and harm its financial condition Conversely extreme warm weather conditions could increase Houston Electrics results of operations in a manner that would not likely be annually recurring A significant portion of Indiana Electrics sales are for space heating and cooling Consequently Indiana Electrics results of operations may be adversely affected by warmerthannormal heating season weather or colderthannormal cooling season weather while more extreme seasonal weather conditions could increase Indiana Electrics results of operations in a manner that would not likely be annually recurring 24 Houston Electric and Indiana Electric as a member of ERCOT and MISO respectively could be subject to higher costs for improvements as well as fines or other sanctions as a result of mandatory reliability standards Houston Electric and Indiana Electric are members of ERCOT and MISO respectively which serve the electric transmission needs of their applicable regions As a result of their respective participation in ERCOT and MISO Houston Electric and Indiana Electric do not have operational control over their transmission facilities and are subject to certain costs for improvements to these regional electric transmission systems In addition the FERC has jurisdiction with respect to ensuring the reliability of electric transmission service including transmission facilities owned by Houston Electric and other utilities within ERCOT and Indiana Electric and other utilities within MISO respectively The FERC has designated the NERC as the ERO to promulgate standards under FERC oversight for all owners operators and users of the bulk power system The FERC has approved the delegation by the NERC of authority for reliability in ERCOT to the Texas RE a Texas nonprofit corporation and for reliability in the portion of MISO that includes Indiana Electric to ReliabilityFirst Corporation a Delaware nonprofit corporation Compliance with mandatory reliability standards may subject Houston Electric and Indiana Electric to higher operating costs and may result in increased capital expenditures In addition if Houston Electric or Indiana Electric were to be found to be in noncompliance with applicable mandatory reliability standards they could be subject to sanctions including substantial monetary penalties Houston Electrics receivables are primarily concentrated in a small number of REPs and any delay or default in such payments could adversely affect Houston Electrics cash flows financial condition and results of operations Houston Electrics receivables from the distribution of electricity are collected from REPs that supply the electricity Houston Electric distributes to their customers As of December 31 2018 Houston Electric did business with approximately 65 REPs Adverse economic conditions structural problems in the market served by ERCOT or financial difficulties of one or more REPs could impair the ability of these REPs to pay for Houston Electrics services or could cause them to delay such payments Houston Electric depends on these REPs to remit payments on a timely basis Applicable regulatory provisions require that customers be shifted to another REP or a provider of last resort if a REP cannot make timely payments Applicable PUCT regulations significantly limit the extent to which Houston Electric can apply normal commercial terms or otherwise seek credit protection from firms desiring to provide retail electric service in its service territory and Houston Electric thus remains at risk for payments related to services provided prior to the shift to another REP or the provider of last resort A significant portion of Houston Electrics billed receivables from REPs are from affiliates of NRG and Vistra Energy Corp formerly known as TCEH Corp Houston Electrics aggregate billed receivables balance from REPs as of December 31 2018 was 207 million Approximately 34 and 12 of this amount was owed by affiliates of NRG and Vistra Energy Corp respectively Any delay or default in payment by REPs could adversely affect Houston Electrics cash flows financial condition and results of operations If a REP were unable to meet its obligations it could consider among various options restructuring under the bankruptcy laws in which event such REP might seek to avoid honoring its obligations and claims might be made by creditors involving payments Houston Electric had received from such REP The AMS deployed throughout Houston Electrics and Indiana Electrics service territories may experience unexpected problems with respect to the timely receipt of accurate metering data Houston Electric and Indiana Electric have deployed an AMS throughout their service territories which integrates equipment and computer software from various vendors to eliminate the need for physical meter readings to be taken at consumers premises such as monthly readings for billing purposes and special readings for Houston Electric associated with a customers change in REPs or the connection or disconnection of electric service Unanticipated difficulties could be encountered during the operation of the AMS including failures or inadequacy of equipment or software difficulties in integrating the various components of the AMS changes in technology cybersecurity issues loss of data and factors outside the control of Houston Electric and Indiana Electric which could result in delayed or inaccurate metering data that might lead to delays or inaccuracies in the calculation and imposition of delivery or other charges which could have a material adverse effect on Houston Electrics or Indiana Electrics results of operations financial condition and cash flows Indiana Electrics execution of its electric generation transition plan and its regulated power supply operations are subject to various risks including timely recovery of capital investments increased costs and facility outages or shutdowns As required by Indiana regulation Indiana Electric filed its 2016 IRP with the IURC in December 2016 Indiana requires each electric utility to perform and submit an IRP that uses economic modeling to consider the costs and risks associated with available resource options to provide reliable electric service for the next 20year period While the IURC does not approve or reject the IRP the process involves the issuance of a staff report that provides comments on the IRP which was issued in November 2017 Indiana Electric has taken the comments provided in the report into consideration in its generation resource plans 25 Consistent with the recommendations presented in Indiana Electrics IRP and as a direct result of significant environmental investments required to comply with current regulations Indiana Electric plans to retire a significant portion of its current generating fleet by the end of 2023 Indiana Electrics electric generation transition plan will require recovery of new capital investments as well as costs of retiring the current generation fleet including decommissioning costs costs of removal and any remaining unrecovered costs of retired assets Currently Indiana Electric relies on coal for substantially all of its generation capacity In February 2018 Indiana Electric filed a petition seeking authorization from the IURC to construct a new 800900 MW natural gas combined cycle generating facility to replace this capacity at an approximate cost of 900 million which includes the cost of a new natural gas pipeline to serve the plant Indiana Electric is requesting a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing construction timelines and costs of new generation resources as well as necessary unit retrofits to implement the generation transition plan Also Indiana Electric is seeking approval to defer some capital costs associated with the generation plan until its next base rate proceeding and may use rate recovery mechanisms to recover other portions of the cost Indiana Electric expects an order from the IURC in the certificate of public convenience and necessity proceeding in the first half of 2019 Given the significance of the plan there is inherent risk associated with the construction of new generation including the ability to procure resources needed to build at a reasonable cost scarcity of resources and labor ability to appropriately estimate costs of new generation the effects of potential construction delays and cost overruns and the ability to meet capacity requirements Additionally Indiana Electrics generating facilities are subject to operational risks that could result in unscheduled plant outages unanticipated operation and maintenance expenses and increased purchase power costs These operational risks can arise from circumstances such as facility shutdowns due to equipment failure or operator error interruption of fuel supply or increased prices of fuel as contracts expire disruptions in the delivery of electricity inability to comply with regulatory or permit requirements labor disputes or natural disasters Further Indiana Electrics coal supply is purchased largely from a single unrelated party and although the coal supply is under longterm contract the loss of this supplier or transportation interruptions could adversely affect Indiana Electrics results of operations financial condition and cash flows Risk Factors Affecting Natural Gas Distribution and Competitive Energy Services Businesses CenterPoint Energy and CERC Rate regulation of NGD may delay or deny its ability to earn an expected return and fully recover its costs NGDs rates are regulated by certain municipalities in Texas only and state commissions based on an analysis of NGDs invested capital expenses and other factors in a test year often either fully or partially historic in comprehensive base rate proceedings subject to periodic review and adjustment Each of these proceedings is subject to thirdparty intervention and appeal and the timing of a general base rate proceeding may be out of NGDs control Thus the rates that NGD is allowed to charge may not match its costs at any given time resulting in what is referred to as regulatory lag Though several interim rate adjustment mechanisms have been approved by jurisdictional regulatory authorities and implemented by NGD to reduce the effects of regulatory lag such adjustment mechanisms are subject to the applicable regulatory bodys approval and are subject to certain limitations that may reduce NGDs ability to adjust its rates Arkansas allows public utilities to elect to have their rates regulated pursuant to a FRP providing for a utilitys base rates to be adjusted once a year In each of Louisiana Mississippi and Oklahoma NGD makes annual filings utilizing various formula rate mechanisms that adjust rates based on a comparison of authorized return to actual return to achieve the allowed return rates in those jurisdictions Additionally in Minnesota the MPUC implemented a full revenue decoupling program which separates approved revenues from the amount of natural gas used by its customers Further in Indiana NGD may file a CSIA every six months to seek rate increases to recover certain federally mandated project costs eg pipeline safety The TDSIC recovered through the CSIA allows the utility to recover 80 of its project costs associated with an IURCapproved sevenyear infrastructure improvement plan as they are incurred with the remaining costs to be deferred until the next base rate case and rate increases are limited to no more than 2 of the utilitys total retail revenues In Ohio the DRR is an annual mechanism that allows a utility to recover its investments in utility plant and operating expenses associated with replacing bare steel and castiron pipelines as well as certain other infrastructure investments The effectiveness of these filings and programs depends on the approval of the applicable state regulatory body In Texas NGDs Houston South Texas BeaumontEast Texas and Texas Coast divisions each submit annual GRIP filings to recover the incremental capital investments made in the preceding year NGD must file a general rate case no later than five years after the initial GRIP implementation date NGD can make no assurance that filings for such mechanisms will result in favorable adjustments to rates Notwithstanding the application of the rate mechanisms discussed above the regulatory process by which rates are determined is subject to change as a result of the legislative process or rulemaking as the case may be and may not always be available or result in rates that will 26 produce recovery of NGDs costs or enable NGD to earn an expected return In addition changes to the interim adjustment mechanisms could result in an increase in regulatory lag or otherwise impact NGDs ability to recover its costs in a timely manner Additionally inherent in the regulatory process is some level of risk that jurisdictional regulatory authorities may initiate investigations of the prudence of operating expenses incurred or capital investments made by NGD and deny the full recovery of NGDs cost of service or the full recovery of incurred natural gas costs in rates To the extent the regulatory process does not allow NGD to make a full and timely recovery of appropriate costs its results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected Unlike CERC Indiana Gas SIGECOs natural gas distribution business and VEDO must seek approval by the IURC and PUCO as applicable for longterm financing authority This authority allows these utilities the flexibility to issue their debt securities among other financing arrangements In the event that the IURC or PUCO do not approve these utilities respective financing authorities they may not be able to fully execute their financing plans and their respective financial conditions results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected Access to natural gas supplies and pipeline transmission and storage capacity are essential components of reliable service for NGDs customers NGD depends on thirdparty service providers to maintain an adequate supply of natural gas and for available storage and intrastate and interstate pipeline capacity to satisfy its customers needs all of which are critical to system reliability Substantially all of NGDs natural gas supply is purchased from intrastate and interstate pipelines If NGD is unable to secure an independent natural gas supply of its own or through its affiliates or if thirdparty service providers fail to timely deliver natural gas to meet NGDs requirements the resulting decrease in natural gas supply in NGDs service territories could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations cash flows and financial condition Additionally a significant disruption whether through reduced intrastate and interstate pipeline transmission or storage capacity or other events affecting natural gas supply including but not limited to operational failures hurricanes tornadoes floods acts of terrorism or cyberattacks or changes in legislative or regulatory requirements could also adversely affect NGDs businesses Further to the extent that NGDs natural gas requirements cannot be met through access to or continued use of existing natural gas infrastructure or if additional infrastructure including onshore and offshore exploration and production facilities gathering and processing systems and pipeline and storage capacity is not constructed at a rate that satisfies demand then NGDs operations could be negatively affected NGD and CES including transportation and storage whether through the use of AMAs or other arrangements are subject to fluctuations in notional natural gas prices as well as geographic and seasonal natural gas price differentials which could affect the ability of their suppliers and customers to meet their obligations or otherwise adversely affect their liquidity results of operations and financial condition NGD and CES are subject to risk associated with changes in the notional price of natural gas as well as geographic and seasonal natural gas price differentials that impact our business including transportation and storage whether through the use of AMAs or other arrangements Increases in natural gas prices might affect NGDs and CESs ability to collect balances due from their customers and for NGD could create the potential for uncollectible accounts expense to exceed the recoverable levels built into tariff rates In addition a sustained period of high natural gas prices could i decrease demand for natural gas in the areas in which NGD and CES operate thereby resulting in decreased sales and revenues and ii increase the risk that NGDs and CESs suppliers or customers fail or are unable to meet their obligations An increase in natural gas prices would also increase working capital requirements by increasing the investment that must be made to maintain natural gas inventory levels Additionally a decrease in natural gas prices could increase the amount of collateral required under hedging arrangements AMAs may be subject to regulatory approval and such agreements may not be renewed or may be renewed with less favorable terms A decline in CERCs credit rating could result in CERC having to provide collateral under its shipping or hedging arrangements or to purchase natural gas which consequently would increase its cash requirements and adversely affect its financial condition If CERCs credit rating were to decline it might be required to post cash collateral under its shipping or hedging arrangements or to purchase natural gas If a credit rating downgrade and the resultant cash collateral requirement were to occur at a time when CERC was experiencing significant working capital requirements or otherwise lacked liquidity CERCs results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected NGDs and CESs revenues and results of operations are seasonal NGDs and CESs revenues are primarily derived from natural gas sales Thus their revenues and results of operations are subject to seasonality weather conditions and other changes in natural gas usage with revenues being higher during the winter 27 months Unusually mild weather in the winter months could diminish our results of operations and harm our financial condition Conversely extreme cold weather conditions could increase our results of operations in a manner that would not likely be annually recurring The states in which NGD provides regulated local natural gas distribution may either through legislation or rules adopt restrictions regarding organization financing and affiliate transactions that could have significant adverse impacts on NGDs ability to operate From time to time proposals have been put forth in some of the states in which NGD does business to give state regulatory authorities increased jurisdiction and scrutiny over organization capital structure intracompany relationships and lines of business that could be pursued by registered holding companies and their affiliates that operate in those states Some of these frameworks attempt to regulate financing activities acquisitions and divestitures and arrangements between the utilities and their affiliates and to restrict the level of nonutility business that can be conducted within the holding company structure Additionally they may impose recordkeeping record access employee training and reporting requirements related to affiliate transactions and reporting in the event of certain downgrading of the utilitys credit rating These regulatory frameworks could have adverse effects on NGDs ability to conduct its utility operations to finance its business and to provide costeffective utility service In addition if more than one state adopts restrictions on similar activities it may be difficult for NGD and us to comply with competing regulatory requirements NGD and CES must compete with alternate energy sources which could result in less natural gas marketed and have an adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows NGD and CES compete primarily with alternate energy sources such as electricity and other fuel sources In some areas intrastate pipelines other natural gas distributors and marketers also compete directly with NGD and CES for natural gas sales to end users In addition as a result of federal regulatory changes affecting interstate pipelines natural gas marketers operating on these pipelines may be able to bypass NGDs facilities and market sell andor transport natural gas directly to commercial and industrial customers Any reduction in the amount of natural gas marketed sold or transported by NGD and CES as a result of competition may have an adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows Infrastructure Services and ESGs operations could be adversely affected by a number of factors Infrastructure Services and ESGs business results are dependent on a number of factors The industries are competitive and many of the contracts are subject to a bidding process Should Infrastructure Services and ESG be unsuccessful in bidding contracts eg federal Indefinite DeliveryIndefinite Quantity contracts for ESG results of operations could be impacted Through competitive bidding the volume of contracted work could vary significantly from year to year Further to the extent there are unanticipated cost increases in completion of the contracted work or issues arise where amounts due for work performed may not be collected the profit margin realized on any single project could be reduced Changes in legislation and regulations impacting the sectors in which the customers served by Infrastructure Services or ESG operate could adversely impact operating results Infrastructure Services enters into a variety of contracts some of which are fixed price Other risks that could adversely affect Infrastructure Services include but are not limited to failure to properly construct pipeline infrastructure loss of significant customers or a significant decline in related customer revenues cancellation of projects by customers andor reductions in the scope of the projects changes in the timing of projects the inability to obtain materials and equipment required to perform services from suppliers and manufacturers and changes in the market prices of oil and natural gas and state regulatory requirements that mandate pipeline replacement programs that would affect the demand for infrastructure construction andor the project margin realized on projects For ESG other risks include but are not limited to discontinuation of the federal ESPC and UESC programs the inability of customers to finance projects risks associated with projects owned or operated failure to appropriately design construct or operate projects and cancellation of projects by customers andor reductions in the scope of the projects In addition Vectrens nonutility businesses have supported its utilities pursuant to service contracts by providing infrastructure services In most instances Vectrens ability to maintain these service contracts depends upon regulatory discretion and there can be no assurance it will be able to obtain future service contracts or that existing arrangements will not be revisited ESGs business has performance and warranty obligations some of which are guaranteed by Vectren In the normal course of business ESG issues performance bonds and other forms of assurance that commit it to operate facilities pay vendors or subcontractors and support warranty obligations Vectren as the parent company will from time to time guarantee its subsidiaries commitments These guaranties do not represent incremental consolidated obligations rather they 28 represent parental guaranties of subsidiary obligations to allow the subsidiary the flexibility to conduct business without posting other forms of collateral Vectren has not been called upon to satisfy any obligations pursuant to these parental guaranties As a result of the closing of the Merger these guaranties would ultimately become obligations of CenterPoint Energy or its subsidiaries Risk Factors Affecting CenterPoint Energys Interests in Enable Midstream Partners LP CenterPoint Energy CenterPoint Energy holds a substantial limited partner interest in Enable 540 of the outstanding common units representing limited partner interests in Enable as of December 31 2018 as well as 50 of the management rights in Enable GP and a 40 interest in the incentive distribution rights held by Enable GP As of December 31 2018 CenterPoint Energy owned an aggregate of 14520000 Enable Series A Preferred Units representing limited partner interests in Enable Accordingly CenterPoint Energys future earnings results of operations cash flows and financial condition will be affected by the performance of Enable the amount of cash distributions it receives from Enable and the value of its interests in Enable Factors that may have a material impact on Enables performance and cash distributions and hence the value of CenterPoint Energys interests in Enable include the risk factors outlined below as well as the risks described elsewhere under Risk Factors that are applicable to Enable CenterPoint Energys cash flows will be adversely impacted if it receives less cash distributions from Enable than it currently expects or if it reduces its ownership in Enable Both CenterPoint Energy and OGE hold their limited partner interests in Enable in the form of common units CenterPoint Energy also holds Enable Series A Preferred Units For the Enable Series A Preferred Units Enable is expected to pay 0625 per Enable Series A Preferred Unit or 250 per Enable Series A Preferred Unit on an annualized basis However distributions on each Enable Series A Preferred Unit are not mandatory and are noncumulative in the event distributions are not declared on the Enable Series A Preferred Units Enable is expected to pay a minimum quarterly distribution of 02875 per unit or 115 per unit on an annualized basis on its outstanding common units to the extent it has sufficient cash from operations after establishment of cash reserves and payment of fees and expenses including payments to Enable GP and its affiliates referred to as available cash Enable may not have sufficient available cash each quarter to enable it i to pay distributions on the Enable Series A Preferred Units or ii maintain or increase the distributions on its common units Additionally distributions on the Enable Series A Preferred Units reduce the amount of available cash Enable has to pay distributions on its common units The amount of cash Enable can distribute on its common units and the Enable Series A Preferred Units will principally depend upon the amount of cash it generates from its operations which will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on among other things  the fees and gross margins it realizes with respect to the volume of natural gas NGLs and crude oil that it handles  the prices of levels of production of and demand for natural gas NGLs and crude oil

amount of cash reserves established by Enable GP  distributions paid on the Enable Series A Preferred Units  any impact on cash levels should any sale of CenterPoint Energys investment in Enable occur as discussed further below and  other business risks affecting its cash levels Additionally CenterPoint Energy may also reduce its ownership in Enable over time through sales in the public equity markets or otherwise of the Enable common units it holds subject to market conditions CenterPoint Energys ability to execute any sale of Enable common units is subject to a number of uncertainties including the timing pricing and terms of any such sale Any sales of Enable common units CenterPoint Energy owns could have an adverse impact on the price of Enable common units or on any trading market for Enable common units Further CenterPoint Energys sales of Enable common units may have an adverse impact on Enables ability to issue equity on satisfactory terms or at all which may limit its ability to expand operations or make future acquisitions Any reduction in CenterPoint Energys interest in Enable would result in decreased distributions from Enable and decrease income which may adversely impact CenterPoint Energys ability to meet its payment obligations and pay dividends on its Common Stock Further any sales of Enable common units would result in a significant amount of taxes due There can be no assurances that any sale of Enable common units in the public equity markets or otherwise will be completed Any sale of Enable common units in the public equity markets or otherwise may involve significant costs and expenses including in connection with any public offering a significant underwriting discount CenterPoint Energy may not realize any or all of the anticipated strategic financial operational or other benefits from any completed sale or reduction in its investment in Enable Furthermore under certain circumstances including following certain changes in the methodology employed by ratings agencies whereby the Enable Series A Preferred Units are no longer eligible for the same or a higher amount of equity credit attributed to the Enable Series A Preferred Units on their original issue date referred to as a rating event Enable has the option to redeem the Enable Series A Preferred Units There can be no assurances that CenterPoint Energy will be able to reinvest any proceeds from such redemption in a manner that provides for a similar rate of return as the Enable Series A Preferred Units The amount of cash Enable has available for distribution to CenterPoint Energy on its common units and the Enable Series A Preferred Units depends primarily on its cash flow rather than on its profitability which may prevent Enable from making distributions even during periods in which Enable records net income The amount of cash Enable has available for distribution on its common units and the Enable Series A Preferred Units depends primarily upon its cash flows and not solely on profitability which will be affected by noncash items As a result Enable may make cash distributions during periods when it records losses for financial accounting purposes and may not make cash distributions during periods when it records net earnings for financial accounting purposes Enable is required to or may at its option redeem the Enable Series A Preferred Units in certain circumstances and Enable may not have sufficient funds to redeem the Enable Series A Preferred Units if required to do so As a holder of the Enable Series A Preferred Units CenterPoint Energy may request that Enable list those units for trading on the NYSE If Enable is unable to list the Enable Series A Preferred Units in certain circumstances it will be required to redeem the Enable Series A Preferred Units There can be no assurance that Enable would have sufficient financial resources available to satisfy its obligation to redeem the Enable Series A Preferred Units In addition mandatory redemption of the Enable Series A Preferred Units could have a material adverse effect on Enables business financial position results of operations and ability to make quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders Additionally Enable may redeem the Enable Series A Preferred Units under certain circumstances including following a rating event Upon a rating event the Enable Series A Preferred Units may be considered by Enable to be an expensive form of indebtedness If Enable does not have sufficient funds to exercise its option to redeem the Enable Series A Preferred Units upon a rating event then such inability could have a material adverse effect on Enables business financial position results of operations and ability to make quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders 30 CenterPoint Energy is not able to exercise control over Enable which entails certain risks Enable is controlled jointly by CenterPoint Energy and OGE who each own 50 of the management rights in Enable GP The board of directors of Enable GP is composed of an equal number of directors appointed by OGE and by CenterPoint Energy the president and chief executive officer of Enable GP and three directors who are independent as defined under the independence standards established by the NYSE Accordingly CenterPoint Energy is not able to exercise control over Enable Although CenterPoint Energy jointly controls Enable with OGE CenterPoint Energy may have conflicts of interest with Enable that could subject it to claims that CenterPoint Energy has breached its fiduciary duty to Enable and its unitholders CenterPoint Energy and OGE each own 50 of the management rights in Enable GP as well as limited partner interests in Enable and interests in the incentive distribution rights held by Enable GP CenterPoint Energy also holds Enable Series A Preferred Units Conflicts of interest may arise between CenterPoint Energy and Enable and its unitholders CenterPoint Energys joint control of Enable GP may increase the possibility of claims of breach of fiduciary or contractual duties including claims of conflicts of interest related to Enable In resolving these conflicts CenterPoint Energy may favor its own interests and the interests of its affiliates over the interests of Enable and its unitholders as long as the resolution does not conflict with Enables partnership agreement These circumstances could subject CenterPoint Energy to claims that in favoring its own interests and those of its affiliates CenterPoint Energy breached a fiduciary or contractual duty to Enable or its unitholders Enable is subject to various operational risks all of which could affect Enables ability to make cash distributions to CenterPoint Energy The execution of Enables businesses is subject to a number of operational risks which include but are not limited to the following  Contract Renewal  Enables contracts are subject to renewal risks To the extent Enable is unable to renew or replace its expiring contracts on terms that are favorable if at all or successfully manage its overall contract mix over time its financial position results of operations and ability to make cash distributions could be adversely affected  Customers  Enable depends on a small number of customers for a significant portion of its gathering and processing revenues and its transportation and storage revenues The loss of or reduction in volumes from these customers or the failure to extend or replace these contracts or the extension or replacement of these contracts on less favorable terms as a result of competition or otherwise could result in a decline in sales of its gathering and processing or transportation and storage services and adversely affect Enables financial position results of operations and ability to make cash distributions  ThirdParty Drilling and Production Decisions  Enables businesses are dependent in part on the natural gas and crude oil drilling and production market conditions and decisions of others over which Enable has no control Further sustained reductions in exploration or production activity in Enables areas of operation and fluctuations in energy prices could lead to further reductions in the utilization of Enables systems which could adversely affect its financial position results of operations and ability to make cash distributions It may also become more difficult to maintain or increase the current volumes on Enables gathering systems and in its processing plants as several of the formations in the unconventional resource plays in which it operates generally have higher initial production rates and steeper production decline curves than wells in more conventional basins Should Enable determine that the economics of its gathering assets do not justify the capital expenditures needed to grow or maintain volumes associated therewith Enable may reduce such capital expenditures which could cause revenues associated with these assets to decline over time  Competition  Enable competes with similar enterprises some of which include large energy companies with greater financial resources and access to natural gas NGL and crude oil supplies in its respective areas of operation primarily through rates terms of service and flexibility and reliability of service Increased competitive pressure in Enables industry which is already highly competitive could adversely affect Enables financial position results of operations and ability to make cash distributions  Cost Recovery of Capital Improvements  Enable may not be able to recover the costs of its substantial planned investment in capital improvements and additions and the actual cost of such improvements and additions may be significantly higher than it anticipates In Enables Form 10K for the fiscal year ended December 31 2018 Enable stated that it expects that its expansion capital could range from approximately 325 million to 425 million and its maintenance capital could range from approximately 105 million to 125 million for the year ending December 31 2019 31  Commodity Prices  Natural gas NGL and crude oil prices are volatile and changes in these prices could adversely affect Enables financial position results of operations and ability to make cash distributions Factors affecting prices are beyond Enables control and include the following i demand for these commodities which fluctuates with changes in market and economic conditions and other factors including the impact of seasonality and weather general economic conditions the level of domestic and offshore natural gas production and consumption ii the availability of imported natural gas LNG NGLs and crude oil iii actions taken by foreign natural gas and oil producing nations iv the availability of local intrastate and interstate transportation systems v the availability and marketing of competitive fuels vi the impact of energy conservation efforts technological advances affecting energy consumption and vii the extent of governmental regulation and taxation Further Enables natural gas processing arrangements expose it to commodity price fluctuations In 2018 6 27 and 67 of Enables processing plant inlet volumes consisted of keepwhole arrangements percentofproceeds or percentofliquids and feebased respectively If the price at which Enable sells natural gas or NGLs is less than the cost at which Enable purchases natural gas or NGLs under these arrangements then Enables financial position results of operations and ability to make cash distributions could be adversely affected  Credit Risk of Customers Enable is exposed to credit risks of its customers and any material nonpayment or nonperformance by its customers whether through severe financial problems or otherwise could adversely affect its financial position results of operations and ability to make cash distributions  Negotiated Rate Contracts  Enable provides certain transportation and storage services under fixedprice negotiated rate contracts which are authorized by the FERC that are not subject to adjustment even if its cost to perform these services exceeds the revenues received from these contracts As of December 31 2018 approximately 44 of Enables aggregate contracted firm transportation capacity on EGT and MRT and 45 of its aggregate contracted firm storage capacity on EGT and MRT was subscribed under such negotiated rate contracts As a result Enables costs could exceed its revenues received under these contracts and if Enables costs increase and it is not able to recover any shortfall of revenue associated with its negotiated rate contracts the cash flow realized by its systems could decrease and therefore the cash Enable has available for distribution could also decrease  Unavailability of Interconnected Facilities  If thirdparty pipelines and other facilities interconnected to Enables gathering processing or transportation facilities including those providing transportation of natural gas and crude oil transportation and fractionation of NGLs and electricity for compression among others become partially or fully unavailable for any reason Enables financial position results of operations and ability to make cash distributions could be adversely affected and  Land Ownership  Enable does not own all of the land on which its pipelines and facilities are located and it is therefore subject to the possibility of more onerous terms andor increased costs to retain necessary land use if it does not have valid rightsofway or if such rightsofway lapse or terminate which could disrupt its operations or result in increased costs related to the construction and continuing operations elsewhere and adversely affect its financial position results of operations and ability to make cash distributions Enable conducts a portion of its operations through joint ventures which subject it to additional risks that could adversely affect the success of these operations and Enables financial position results of operations and ability to make cash distributions Enable conducts a portion of its operations through joint ventures with third parties including Enbridge Inc DCP Midstream LP CVR Refining LP Trans Louisiana Gas Pipeline Inc and Pablo Gathering LLC Enable may also enter into other joint venture arrangements in the future These third parties may have obligations that are important to the success of the joint venture such as the obligation to pay their share of capital and other costs of the joint venture Enables joint venture arrangements may involve risks not otherwise present when operating assets directly including for example  Enable shares certain approval rights over major decisions and may not be able to control decisions including control of cash distributions to Enable from the joint venture  Enable may incur liabilities as a result of an action taken by its joint venture partners including leaving Enable liable for the other joint venture partners shares of joint venture liabilities if those partners do not pay their share of the joint ventures obligations 32  Enable may be required to devote significant management time to the requirements of and matters relating to the joint ventures  Enables insurance policies may not fully cover loss or damage incurred by both Enable and its joint venture partners in certain circumstances  Enables joint venture partners may take actions contrary to its instructions or requests or contrary to its policies or objectives and  disputes between Enable and its joint venture partners may result in delays litigation or operational impasses The risks described above or the failure to continue Enables joint ventures or to resolve disagreements with its joint venture partners could adversely affect its ability to transact the business that is the subject of such joint venture which would in turn adversely affect Enables financial position results of operations and ability to make cash distributions The agreements under which Enable formed certain joint ventures may subject it to various risks limit the actions it may take with respect to the assets subject to the joint venture and require Enable to grant rights to its joint venture partners that could limit its ability to benefit fully from future positive developments Some joint ventures require Enable to make significant capital expenditures If Enable does not timely meet its financial commitments or otherwise does not comply with its joint venture agreements its rights to participate exercise operator rights or otherwise influence or benefit from the joint venture may be adversely affected Certain of Enables joint venture partners may have substantially greater financial resources than Enable has and Enable may not be able to secure the funding necessary to participate in operations its joint venture partners propose thereby reducing its ability to benefit from the joint venture Under certain circumstances Enbridge Inc could have the right to purchase Enables ownership interest in SESH at fair market value Enable owns a 50 ownership interest in SESH The remaining 50 ownership interest is held by Enbridge Inc CenterPoint Energy owns 540 of Enables common units 100 of the Enable Series A Preferred Units and a 40 economic interest in Enable GP Pursuant to the terms of the limited liability company agreement of SESH as amended if at any time CenterPoint Energy has a right to receive less than 50 of Enables distributions through its interests in Enable and Enable GP or do not have the ability to exercise certain control rights Enbridge Inc could have the right to purchase Enables interest in SESH at fair market value subject to certain exceptions Enables ability to grow is dependent in part on its ability to access external financing sources on acceptable terms Enable expects that it will distribute all of its available cash to its unitholders As a result Enable is expected to rely significantly upon external financing sources including commercial bank borrowings and the issuance of debt and equity securities to fund acquisitions and expansion capital expenditures To the extent Enable is unable to finance growth externally or through internally generated cash flows Enables cash distribution policy may significantly impair its ability to grow In addition because Enable is expected to distribute all of its available cash its growth may not be as fast as businesses that reinvest their available cash to expand ongoing operations To the extent Enable issues additional units in connection with any acquisitions or expansion capital expenditures the payment of distributions on those additional units may increase the risk that Enable will be unable to maintain or increase its per unit distribution level which in turn may impact the available cash that it has to distribute on each unit There are no limitations in Enables partnership agreement on its ability to issue additional units including units ranking senior to the common units The incurrence of additional commercial borrowings or other debt by Enable to finance its growth strategy would result in increased interest expense which in turn may negatively impact the available cash that Enable has to distribute to its unitholders Enable depends in part on access to the capital markets and other external financing sources to fund its expansion capital expenditures although it has also increasingly relied on cash flow generated from operations Historically unit prices of midstream master limited partnerships have experienced periods of volatility In addition because Enables common units are yieldbased securities rising market interest rates could impact the relative attractiveness of its common units to investors As a result of capital market volatility Enable may be unable to issue equity or debt on satisfactory terms or at all which may limit its ability to expand its operations or make future acquisitions 33 Enables debt levels may limit its flexibility in obtaining additional financing and in pursuing other business opportunities As of December 31 2018 Enable had approximately 29 billion of longterm debt outstanding excluding the premiums discounts and unamortized debt expense on their senior notes 649 million outstanding under its commercial paper program and 500 million outstanding of its 240 senior notes dues 2019 excluding unamortized debt expense Enable has a 175 billion revolving credit facility for working capital capital expenditures and other partnership purposes including acquisitions with approximately 250 million in borrowings outstanding and 848 million remaining available as of February 1 2019 Enable has the ability to incur additional debt subject to limitations in its credit facilities The levels of Enables debt could have important consequences including the following  the ability to obtain additional financing if necessary for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions or other purposes may be impaired or the financing may not be available on favorable terms if at all  a portion of cash flows will be required to make interest payments on the debt reducing the funds that would otherwise be available for operations future business opportunities and distributions  Enables debt level will make it more vulnerable to competitive pressures or a downturn in its business or the economy generally and  Enables debt level may limit its flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions Enables ability to service its debt will depend upon among other things its future financial and operating performance which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions commodity prices and financial business regulatory and other factors some of which are beyond Enables control If operating results are not sufficient to service current or future indebtedness Enable may be forced to take actions such as reducing distributions reducing or delaying business activities acquisitions investments or capital expenditures selling assets restructuring or refinancing debt or seeking additional equity capital These actions may not be effected on satisfactory terms or at all Further any reductions in Enables credit ratings could increase its financing costs and the cost of maintaining certain contractual relationships Enable cannot assure that its credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment circumstances warrant If any of Enables credit ratings are below investment grade it may have higher future borrowing costs and Enable or its subsidiaries may be required to post cash collateral or letters of credit under certain contractual agreements If cash collateral requirements were to occur at a time when Enable was experiencing significant working capital requirements or otherwise lacked liquidity its financial position results of operations and ability to make cash distributions could be adversely affected Enables credit facilities contain operating and financial restrictions including covenants and restrictions that may be affected by events beyond Enables control which could adversely affect its financial condition results of operations and ability to make distributions Enables credit facilities contain customary covenants that among other things limit its ability to  permit its subsidiaries to incur or guarantee additional debt  incur or permit to exist certain liens on assets  dispose of assets  merge or consolidate with another company or engage in a change of control  enter into transactions with affiliates on nonarms length terms and  change the nature of its business Enables credit facilities also require it to maintain certain financial ratios Enables ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond its control and we cannot assure you that it will meet those ratios In addition Enables credit facilities contain events of default customary for agreements of this nature 34 Enables ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in its credit facilities may be affected by events beyond its control including prevailing economic financial and industry conditions If market or other economic conditions deteriorate Enables ability to comply with these covenants may be impaired If Enable violates any of the restrictions covenants ratios or tests in its credit facilities a significant portion of its indebtedness may become immediately due and payable In addition Enables lenders commitments to make further loans to it under the revolving credit facility may be suspended or terminated Enable might not have or be able to obtain sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments Enables businesses are exposed to various regulatory risks Enables operations are subject to extensive regulation by federal state and local regulatory authorities Changes or additional regulatory measures adopted by such authorities could adversely affect Enables financial position results of operations and ability to make cash distributions This regulation includes but is not limited to the following  Rate Regulation  The rates charged by several of Enables pipeline systems including for interstate gas transportation service provided by its intrastate pipelines are regulated by the FERC Enables pipeline operations that are not regulated by the FERC may be subject to state and local regulation applicable to intrastate natural gas transportation services and crude oil gathering services The FERC and state regulatory agencies also regulate other terms and conditions of the services Enable may offer If one of these regulatory agencies on its own initiative or due to challenges by third parties were to lower its tariff rates or deny any rate increase or other material changes to the types or terms and conditions of service Enable might propose or offer the profitability of Enables pipeline businesses could suffer  FERC Revised Policy Statement and NOPR  In a series of related issuances on March 15 2018 the FERC issued a Revised Policy Statement stating that it will no longer permit pipelines organized as MLPs to recover an income tax allowance in their costofservice rates On July 18 2018 FERC issued a Final Rule adopting procedures that are generally the same as proposed in a March 15 2018 NOPR implementing the Revised Policy Statement and the corporate income tax rate reduction with certain clarifications and modifications For more information please read Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Regulatory Matters in Item 7 of Part II of this report which discussion is incorporated herein by reference If FERC requires Enable to establish new tariff rates for either its natural gas or crude oil pipelines that reflect a lower federal corporate income tax rate it is possible the rates would be reduced which could adversely affect Enables financial position results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to its unitholders With regard to FERCjurisdictional rates on Enables crude oil pipelines the FERC plans to address the Revised Policy Statement and corporate tax rate reduction in its next fiveyear review of the oil pipeline rate index which will occur in 2020 and become effective July 1 2021 The potential rate impacts from the revision are currently uncertain  Permits Licenses and Approvals  Enable may be unable to obtain or renew federal or state permits licenses or approvals necessary for its operations which could inhibit its ability to do business All of these permits licenses approval limits and standards require a significant amount of monitoring record keeping and reporting to demonstrate compliance with the underlying permit license approval limit or standard Noncompliance or incomplete documentation of Enables compliance status may result in the imposition of fines penalties and injunctive relief Further to obtain new permits or renew permits and other approvals in the future Enable may be required to prepare and present data to governmental authorities pertaining to potential adverse impact of a proposed project Compliance with these regulatory requirements may be expensive and may significantly lengthen the time required to prepare applications and to receive authorizations and consequently could disrupt Enables project construction schedules  Hydraulic Fracturing Regulation  Increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing and waste water injection wells could result in reductions or delays in natural gas or crude oil production by Enables customers which could adversely affect its financial position results of operations and ability to make cash distributions and  Jurisdictional Characterization of Assets  Enables natural gas gathering and intrastate transportation systems are generally exempt from the jurisdiction of the FERC under the NGA and its crude oil gathering system in the Anadarko Basin is generally exempt from the jurisdiction of the FERC under ICA FERC regulation may indirectly impact these businesses and the markets for products derived from these businesses Natural gas gathering and intrastate crude oil gathering may receive greater regulatory scrutiny at the state level therefore Enables operations could be adversely affected should they become subject to the application of state regulation of rates and services A change in the jurisdictional characterization of some of Enables assets by federal state or local regulatory agencies or a change in policy by those agencies may result in increased regulation of its assets which may cause its revenues to decline and operating expenses to increase 35 Other Risk Factors Affecting Our Businesses or CenterPoint Energys Interests in Enable Midstream Partners LP The success of the Merger depends in part on CenterPoint Energys ability to realize anticipated benefits and conduct an effective integration process The success of the Merger will depend in part on CenterPoint Energys ability to realize the expected benefits in the anticipated timeframe including operating efficiencies growth opportunities cost savings and customer retention from integrating CenterPoint Energys and Vectrens businesses while at the same time continuing to provide consistent high quality services The integration process could be complex costly and time consuming including the diversion of significant management time and resources thereto and may result in the following challenges among others  unanticipated delays disruptions issues or costs in integrating operations financial and accounting information technology communications and other systems  potential inconsistencies in procedures practices policies controls and standards  possible differences in compensation arrangements management perspectives and corporate culture and  loss of or difficulties retaining talented employees or valuable thirdparty relationships CenterPoint Energy must also successfully integrate its systems of internal controls to accurately provide reliable financial reports including reporting of its financial condition results of operations or cash flows effectively prevent fraud and operate successfully as a public company If CenterPoint Energys efforts to integrate and maintain an effective system of internal controls are not successful it is unable to maintain adequate controls over its financial reporting and processes in the future or it is unable to comply with its obligations under Section 404 of the SarbanesOxley Act of 2002 CenterPoint Energys operating results could be harmed or it may fail to meet its reporting obligations Ineffective internal controls also could cause investors to lose confidence in CenterPoint Energys reported financial information which would likely have a negative effect on the trading prices of its securities Even with the successful integration of the businesses CenterPoint Energy may not achieve the expected results or economic benefits including any expected revenue or synergy opportunities Failure to fully realize the anticipated benefits could adversely affect CenterPoint Energys results of operations financial condition and cash flows and have a negative effect on the trading prices of its securities Cyberattacks physical security breaches acts of terrorism or other disruptions could adversely impact our or Enables reputation results of operations financial condition andor cash flows We and Enable are subject to cyber and physical security risks related to adversaries attacking information technology systems network infrastructure technology and facilities used to conduct almost all of our and Enables business which includes among other things i managing operations and other business processes and ii protecting sensitive information maintained in the normal course of business For example the operation of our electric transmission and distribution system is dependent on not only physical interconnection of our facilities but also on communications among the various components of our system This reliance on information and communication between and among those components has increased since deployment of smart meters and the intelligent grid Further certain of the various internal systems we use to conduct our businesses are highly integrated Consequently a cyberattack or unauthorized access in any one of these systems could potentially impact the other systems Similarly our and Enables business operations are interconnected with external networks and facilities The distribution of natural gas to our customers requires communications with Enables pipeline facilities and thirdparty systems The gathering processing and transportation of natural gas from Enables gathering processing and pipeline facilities and crude oil gathering pipeline systems also rely on communications among its facilities and with thirdparty systems that may be delivering natural gas or crude oil into or receiving natural gas or crude oil and other products from Enables facilities Disruption of those communications whether caused by physical disruption such as storms or other natural disasters by failure of equipment or technology or by manmade events such as cyberattacks or acts of terrorism may disrupt our or Enables ability to conduct operations and control assets Cyberattacks and unauthorized access could also result in the loss or unauthorized use of confidential proprietary or critical infrastructure data or security breaches of other information technology systems that could disrupt operations and critical business functions adversely affect reputation increase costs and subject us or Enable to possible legal claims and liability Further third parties including vendors suppliers and contractors who perform certain services for us or administer and maintain our sensitive 36 information could also be targets of cyberattacks and unauthorized access Neither we nor Enable is fully insured against all cybersecurity risks any of which could adversely affect our reputation and could have a material adverse effect on either our or Enables results of operations financial condition andor cash flows As domestic and global cyber threats are ongoing and increasing in sophistication magnitude and frequency our and Enables critical energy infrastructure may be targets of terrorist activities or otherwise that could disrupt our respective business operations Any such disruptions could result in significant costs to repair damaged facilities and implement increased security measures which could have a material adverse effect on either our or Enables results of operations financial condition andor cash flows Failure to maintain the security of personally identifiable information could adversely affect us In connection with our business we and our vendors suppliers and contractors collect and retain personally identifiable information eg information of our customers shareholders suppliers and employees and there is an expectation that we and such third parties will adequately protect that information The US regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding New laws and regulations governing data privacy and the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information including recent California legislation pose increasingly complex compliance challenges and potentially elevate our costs Any failure by us to comply with these laws and regulations including as a result of a security or privacy breach could result in significant penalties and liabilities for us A significant theft loss or fraudulent use of the personally identifiable information we maintain or failure of our vendors suppliers and contractors to use or maintain such data in accordance with contractual provisions could adversely impact our reputation and could result in significant costs fines litigation Additionally if we acquire a company that has violated or is not in compliance with applicable data protection laws we may incur significant liabilities and penalties as a result We are subject to operational and financial risks and liabilities arising from environmental laws and regulations Our operations and the operations of Enable are subject to stringent and complex laws and regulations pertaining to the environment As an owner or operator of natural gas pipelines distribution systems and storage electric generating facilities and electric transmission and distribution systems and the facilities that support these systems we must comply with these laws and regulations at the federal state and local levels These laws and regulations can restrict or impact our business activities in many ways such as  restricting the way we manage hazardous and nonhazardous wastes  limiting or prohibiting construction activities in sensitive areas such as wetlands coastal regions or areas inhabited by endangered species  requiring remedial action and monitoring to mitigate environmental conditions caused by our operations or attributable to former operations  limiting airborne emissions from electric generating facilities including particulate matter sulfur dioxide SO 2  nitrogen oxides NOx and mercury and the disposal nonhazardous substances such as coal combustion residuals among others  enjoining the operations of facilities with permits issued pursuant to such environmental laws and regulations and  impacting the demand for our services by directly or indirectly affecting the use or price of natural gas To comply with these requirements we may need to spend substantial amounts and devote other resources from time to time to  construct or acquire new facilities and equipment  acquire permits for facility operations  modify or replace existing and proposed equipment and  decommission or remediate waste management areas fuel storage facilities and other locations Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative civil and criminal enforcement measures including the assessment of monetary penalties the imposition of remedial actions and the issuance of orders enjoining 37 future operations Certain environmental statutes impose strict joint and several liability for costs required to clean restore and monitor sites where hazardous substances have been stored disposed or released Moreover it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other waste products into the environment In April 2015 the EPA finalized its CCR Rule which regulates ash as nonhazardous material under the RCRA Under the CCR Rule Indiana Electric is required to complete integrity assessments and groundwater monitoring studies In January 2018 Indiana Electric completed its first annual groundwater monitoring and corrective action report This report identified localized impacts to groundwater near Indiana Electrics coal impoundments Further analysis is ongoing In October 2018 Indiana Electric completed the CCR Rules required evaluation of the placement of Indiana Electrics coal ash ponds relative to the uppermost aquifer This evaluation indicated that Indiana Electric must cease placing materials into the ash ponds by October 31 2020 and initiate closure of the ponds thereafter However the October 2020 closure deadline which resulted from a July 2018 amendment to the CCR Rule is being challenged in the DC Circuit Were the July 2018 amendment vacated the deadline for Indiana Electric to cease placing materials into the ash ponds and initiate closure could revert to the original April 2019 deadline However the CCR Rule allows for a pond to continue receiving materials beyond the deadline for closure upon certification that there is an absence of alternative disposal capacity Indiana Electric plans to seek such an extension that would allow it to continue to use the ponds through completion of the generation transition plans by December 31 2023 Failure to obtain this extension may result in increased and potentially significant operational costs in connection with the accelerated implementation of an alternative ash disposal system or adversely impact Indiana Electrics future operations Failure to comply with these requirements could also result in an enforcement proceeding including imposition of fines and penalties Further a release of coal ash that presents an imminent and substantial endangerment to health of the environment could result in remediation costs civil andor criminal penalties claims litigation increased regulation and compliance costs and reputational damage all of which could adversely affect the financial condition of Indiana Electric The recent trend in environmental regulation has been to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may impact the environment and thus there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation and actual future expenditures may be greater than the amounts we currently anticipate Our insurance coverage may not be sufficient Insufficient insurance coverage and increased insurance costs could adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flows We currently have general liability and property insurance in place to cover certain of our facilities in amounts that we consider appropriate Such policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles and do not include business interruption coverage Insurance coverage may not be available in the future at current costs or on commercially reasonable terms and the insurance proceeds received for any loss of or any damage to any of our facilities may not be sufficient to restore the loss or damage without negative impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows In common with other companies in its line of business that serve coastal regions Houston Electric does not have insurance covering its transmission and distribution system other than substations because Houston Electric believes it to be cost prohibitive and believes insurance capacity to be limited Historically Houston Electric has been able to recover the costs incurred in restoring its transmission and distribution properties following hurricanes or other disasters through issuance of storm restoration bonds or a change in its regulated rates or otherwise In the future any such recovery may not be granted Therefore Houston Electric may not be able to restore any loss of or damage to any of its transmission and distribution properties without negative impact on its results of operations financial condition and cash flows Enable is not fully insured against all risks inherent in its business Enable currently has general liability and property insurance in place to cover certain of its facilities in amounts that Enable considers appropriate Such policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles Enable does not have business interruption insurance coverage for all of its operations Insurance coverage may not be available in the future at current costs or on commercially reasonable terms and the insurance proceeds received for any loss of or any damage to any of Enables facilities may not be sufficient to restore the loss or damage without negative impact on its results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions Our operations and Enables operations are subject to all of the risks and hazards inherent in the gathering processing transportation and storage of natural gas and crude oil including  damage to pipelines and plants related equipment and surrounding properties caused by hurricanes tornadoes floods fires earthquakes and other natural disasters acts of terrorism and actions by third parties  inadvertent damage from construction vehicles and farm and utility equipment 38  leaks of natural gas NGLs crude oil and other hydrocarbons or losses of natural gas NGLs and crude oil as a result of the malfunction of equipment or facilities  ruptures fires and explosions and  other hazards that could also result in personal injury and loss of life pollution and suspension of operations These risks could result in substantial losses due to personal injury andor loss of life severe damage to and destruction of property plant and equipment and pollution or other environmental damage These risks may also result in curtailment or suspension of our or Enables operations A natural disaster or other hazard affecting the areas in which we or Enable operate could have a material adverse effect on our or Enables operations The Registrants could incur liabilities associated with businesses and assets that they have transferred to others Under some circumstances the Registrants could incur liabilities associated with assets and businesses no longer owned by them These assets and businesses were previously owned by Reliant Energy a predecessor of Houston Electric directly or through subsidiaries and include  merchant energy energy trading and REP businesses transferred to RRI or its subsidiaries in connection with the organization and capitalization of RRI prior to its initial public offering in 2001 and now owned by affiliates of NRG and  Texas electric generating facilities transferred to a subsidiary of Texas Genco in 2002 later sold to a third party and now owned by an affiliate of NRG In connection with the organization and capitalization of RRI now GenOn and Texas Genco now an affiliate of NRG those companies andor their subsidiaries assumed liabilities associated with various assets and businesses transferred to them and agreed to certain indemnity agreements of the Registrants Such indemnities have applied in various asbestos and other environmental matters that arise from time to time and cases such as the litigation arising out of sales of natural gas in California and other markets further appellate review of the last remaining case involving CES a subsidiary of CERC Corp has been stayed pending approval of a settlement agreement following the Ninth Court of Appeals reversal in August 2018 of the district courts grant of summary judgment in favor of CES In June 2017 GenOn and various affiliates filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code CenterPoint Energy CERC and CES submitted proofs of claim in the bankruptcy proceedings to protect their indemnity rights In October 2018 CES GenOn and the plaintiffs reached an agreement to settle all claims against CES and CESs indemnity claims against GenOn subject to approvals by the bankruptcy court and the federal district court In December 2018 GenOn completed its reorganization and emerged from Chapter 11 and in January 2019 the bankruptcy court approved the settlement between CES and GenOn If the settlement agreement between CES GenOn and the plaintiffs is not approved by the federal district court CES could incur liability and be responsible for satisfying it In connection with our sale of Texas Genco the separation agreement was amended to provide that Texas Genco would no longer be liable for and CenterPoint Energy would assume and agree to indemnify Texas Genco against liabilities that Texas Genco originally assumed in connection with its organization to the extent and only to the extent that such liabilities are covered by certain insurance policies held by CenterPoint Energy and in certain of the asbestos lawsuits CenterPoint Energy has agreed to continue to defend such claims to the extent they are covered by insurance maintained by CenterPoint Energy subject to reimbursement of the costs of such defense by an NRG affiliate Our results of operations financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully operate our facilities or perform certain corporate functions Our performance depends on the successful operation of our facilities Operating these facilities involves many risks including  operator error or failure of equipment or processes including failure to follow appropriate safety protocols  the handling of hazardous equipment or materials that could result in serious personal injury loss of life and environmental and property damage  operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements 39  labor disputes  information technology or financial system failures including those due to the implementation and integration of new technology that impair our information technology infrastructure reporting systems or disrupt normal business operations  information technology failure that affects our ability to access customer information or causes us to lose confidential or proprietary data that materially and adversely affects our reputation or exposes us to legal claims and  catastrophic events such as fires earthquakes explosions leaks floods droughts hurricanes terrorism pandemic health events or other similar occurrences which may require participation in mutual assistance efforts by us or other utilities to assist in power restoration efforts Such events may result in a decrease or elimination of revenue from our facilities an increase in the cost of operating our facilities or delays in cash collections any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition andor cash flows Our and Enables success depends upon our and Enables ability to attract effectively transition motivate and retain key employees and identify and develop talent to succeed senior management We and Enable depend on senior executive officers and other key personnel Our and Enables success depends on our and Enables ability to attract effectively transition and retain key personnel The inability to recruit and retain or effectively transition key personnel or the unexpected loss of key personnel may adversely affect our and Enables operations In addition because of the reliance on our and Enables management team our and Enables future success depends in part on our and Enables ability to identify and develop talent to succeed senior management The retention of key personnel and appropriate senior management succession planning will continue to be critically important to the successful implementation of our and Enables strategies Failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could adversely impact our and Enables results of operations Our and Enables businesses are dependent on recruiting retaining and motivating employees Certain circumstances such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements a mismatch of existing skillsets to future needs or the unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges such as a lack of resources loss of knowledge or a lengthy time period associated with skill development Our and Enables costs including costs to replace employees productivity costs and safety costs may rise Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate our and Enables businesses If we and Enable are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce our and Enables results of operations could be negatively affected Climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for our or Enables services Regulatory agencies have from time to time considered adopting new legislation andor modifying existing laws and regulations to reduce GHGs and there continues to be a wideranging policy and regulatory debate both nationally and internationally regarding the potential impact of GHGs and possible means for their regulation Efforts have been made and continue to be made in the international community toward the adoption of international treaties or protocols that would address global climate change issues Due to the electric generating facilities acquired in the Merger CenterPoint Energy is subject to the requirements of the CPP which requires a 32 reduction in carbon emissions from 2005 levels While implementation of the CPP remains uncertain due to the February 2016 US Supreme Court stay delaying implementation during court challenges and an October 2017 proposed rule from the EPA which if finalized would result in the CPPs repeal as written the CPP may substantially affect both the costs and operating characteristics of CenterPoint Energys fossil fuel generating plants and NGD business In August 2018 the EPA proposed a CPP replacement rule the Affordable Clean Energy ACE rule which if finalized could similarly impact the costs of CenterPoint Energys fossil fuel generating plants In addition to regulatory risk we may be subject to climate change lawsuits which could result in substantial penalties or damages Moreover evolving investor sentiment related to the use of fossil fuels and initiatives to restrict continued production of fossil fuels may have substantial impacts on CenterPoint Energys electric generation and NGD businesses 40 Following a finding by the EPA that certain GHGs represent an endangerment to human health the EPA adopted two sets of rules regulating GHG emissions under the Clean Air Act one that requires a reduction in emissions of GHGs from motor vehicles and another that regulates emissions of GHGs from certain large stationary sources The EPA has also expanded its existing GHG emissions reporting requirements These permitting and reporting requirements could lead to further regulation of GHGs by the EPA As a distributor and transporter of natural gas or a consumer of natural gas in its pipeline and gathering businesses NGDs or Enables revenues operating costs and capital requirements as applicable could be adversely affected as a result of any regulatory action that would require installation of new control technologies or a modification of its operations or would have the effect of reducing the consumption of natural gas Further Indiana Electrics current generating facilities substantially rely on coal for their operations Additionally Houston Electrics and Indiana Electrics transmission and distribution businesses revenues could be adversely affected to the extent any resulting regulatory action has the effect of reducing consumption of electricity by ultimate consumers within its service territory Likewise incentives to conserve energy or use energy sources other than natural gas could result in a decrease in demand for our services Climate changes could adversely impact financial results from our and Enables businesses and result in more frequent and more severe weather events which could adversely affect the results of operations of our businesses A changing climate creates uncertainty and could result in broad changes both physical and financial in nature to our service territories If climate changes occur that result in warmer temperatures in our service territories financial results from our and Enables businesses could be adversely impacted For example NGD could be adversely affected through lower natural gas sales and Enables natural gas gathering processing and transportation and crude oil gathering businesses could experience lower revenues Another possible result of climate change is more frequent and more severe weather events such as hurricanes tornadoes or ice storms Since many of our facilities are located along or near the Gulf Coast increased or more severe hurricanes or tornadoes could increase our costs to repair damaged facilities and restore service to our customers When we cannot deliver electricity or natural gas to customers or our customers cannot receive our services our financial results can be impacted by lost revenues and we generally must seek approval from regulators to recover restoration costs To the extent we are unable to recover those costs or if higher rates resulting from our recovery of such costs result in reduced demand for our services our future financial results may be adversely impacted Decreased energy use may also require us to retire current infrastructure that is no longer needed We are uncertain how state commissions and local municipalities may require us to respond to the effects of the TCJA and these regulatory requirements may adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows On December 22 2017 President Trump signed into law the TCJA which resulted in significant changes to federal tax laws effective January 1 2018 including but not limited to a reduction in the corporate income tax rate For Houston Electric Indiana Electric and NGD federal income tax expense is included in the rates approved by state commissions and local municipalities and charged by those utilities to consumers When Houston Electric Indiana Electric and NGD have general rate cases and other periodic rate adjustments we expect the lower corporate tax expense resulting from the TCJA which includes determining the treatment of EDIT along with other increases and decreases in our revenue requirements to be incorporated into Houston Electrics Indiana Electrics and NGDs future rates Nevertheless regulators may require us to respond to the TCJA in other ways including through faster recoveries of reductions in federal income tax expense accounting orders to reflect a liability to return to customers in future rate proceedings accelerated returns to consumers of previously collected deferred federal income taxes increased funding of infrastructure upgrades or offsets of future rate increases The effect on us of any potential return of tax savings resulting from the TCJA to consumers may differ depending on how each regulatory body requires us to return such savings We can provide no assurances on how any regulatory body will ultimately require us to act As such we are currently unable to determine the impact of these potential regulatory actions in response to the enactment of the TCJA which may adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows For further information see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Regulatory Matters in Item 7 of Part II of this report In addition the TCJA also includes a variety of other changes such as a limitation on the tax deductibility of interest expense and acceleration of business asset expensing among others Several provisions of the TCJA are not generally applicable to the public utility industry including the limitation on the tax deductibility of interest expense and the acceleration of business asset expensing We continue to assess the impact that the TCJA may have on our future results of operations financial condition and cash flows which impact may adversely affect our future results of operations financial condition and cash flows 41 NGD and Enable may incur significant costs and liabilities resulting from pipeline integrity and other similar programs and related repairs Certain of NGDs and Enables pipeline operations are subject to pipeline safety laws and regulations The DOTs PHMSA has adopted regulations requiring pipeline operators to develop integrity management programs including more frequent inspections and other measures for transportation pipelines located in high consequence areas which are those areas where a leak or rupture could do the most harm The regulations require pipeline operators including NGD and Enable to among other things  perform ongoing assessments of pipeline integrity  develop a baseline plan to prioritize the assessment of a covered pipeline segment  identify and characterize applicable threats that could impact a high consequence area  improve data collection integration and analysis  develop processes for performance management record keeping management of change and communication  repair and remediate pipelines as necessary and  implement preventive and mitigating action Failure to comply with PHMSA or analogous state pipeline safety regulations could result in a number of consequences that may have an adverse effect on NGDs and Enables operations Both NGD and Enable incur significant costs associated with their compliance with existing PHMSA and comparable state regulations which may not be recoverable in rates Changes to pipeline safety laws and regulations that result in more stringent or costly safety standards could have a significant adverse effect on NGD and Enable Changes to pipeline safety regulations occur frequently For example PHMSA is expected to publish finalized regulations in 2019 for both natural gas and hazardous liquids pipelines that will significantly extend and expand the reach of certain PHMSA integrity management requirements eg period assessments leak detection and repairs regardless of proximity to a high consequence area The final rules may also impose new requirements for certain unregulated pipelines including gathering lines The adoption of new regulations requiring more comprehensive or stringent safety standards could require us to install new or modified safety controls pursue new capital projects or conduct maintenance programs on an accelerated basis all of which could require us and Enable to incur increased and potentially significant operational costs Aging infrastructure may lead to increased costs and disruptions in operations that could negatively impact our financial results We have risks associated with aging infrastructure assets The age of certain of our assets may result in a need for replacement or higher level of maintenance costs as a result of our risk based federal and state compliant integrity management programs Failure to achieve timely recovery of these expenses could adversely impact revenues and could result in increased capital expenditures or expenses Further with respect to NGDs operations if certain pipeline replacements for example castiron or bare steel pipe are not completed timely or successfully government agencies and private parties might allege the uncompleted replacements caused events such as fires explosions or leaks Although we maintain insurance for certain of our facilities our insurance coverage may not be sufficient in the event that a catastrophic loss is alleged to have been caused by a failure to timely complete equipment replacements Insufficient insurance coverage and increased insurance costs could adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flows The operation of our facilities depends on good labor relations with our employees Several of our businesses have entered into and have in place collective bargaining agreements with different labor unions We have several separate bargaining units each with a unique collective bargaining agreement described below  The collective bargaining agreement with IBEW Local 66 related to employees of Houston Electric is scheduled to expire in May 2020  The collective bargaining agreements with USW Locals 13227 and 131 related to NGDs employees in Texas are scheduled to expire in June 2022 and July 2022 respectively 42  The collective bargaining agreements with Gas Workers Union Local 340 IBEW Local 949 and OPEIU Local 12 and Mankato related to NGD employees in Minnesota are scheduled to expire in April 2020 December 2020 May 2021 and March 2021 respectively  The collective bargaining agreements with IBEW Local 1393 USW Locals 12213 and 7441 related to employees of NGD in Indiana are scheduled to expire in December 2020  The collective bargaining agreements with the Teamsters Chauffeurs Warehousemen and Helpers Union Local 135 and Utility Workers Union Local 175 related to employees of Indiana Electric were recently renegotiated and are scheduled to expire in September 2021 and October 2021 respectively and  The collective bargaining agreement with IBEW Local 702 related to employees of Indiana Electric was scheduled to expire in June 2019 but was renegotiated in January 2019 with the ratification of a new threeyear labor agreement Additionally Infrastructure Services negotiates various trade agreements through contractor associations The two primary associations are the DCA and the PLCA These trade agreements are with a variety of construction unions including Laborers International Union of North America International Union of Operating Engineers United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipe Fitting Industry and Teamsters The trade agreements have varying expiration dates in 2020 2021 and 2022 In addition these subsidiaries have various project agreements and small local agreements These agreements expire upon completion of a specific project or on various dates throughout the year Any failure to reach an agreement on new labor contracts or to negotiate these labor contracts might result in strikes boycotts or other labor disruptions These potential labor disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our businesses results of operations andor cash flows Labor disruptions strikes or significant negotiated wage and benefit increases whether due to union activities employee turnover or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our businesses results of operations andor cash flows Our businesses will continue to have to adapt to technological change and may not be successful or may have to incur significant expenditures to adapt to technological change We operate in businesses that require sophisticated data collection processing systems software and other technology Some of the technologies supporting the industries we serve are changing rapidly and increasing in complexity New technologies will emerge or grow that may be superior to or may not be compatible with some of our existing technologies and may require us to make significant expenditures so that we can continue to provide costeffective and reliable methods for energy production and delivery Among such technological advances are distributed generation resources eg private solar microturbines fuel cells energy storage devices and more energyefficient buildings and products designed to reduce consumption As these technologies become a more costcompetitive option over time whether through cost effectiveness or government incentives and subsidies certain customers may choose to meet their own energy needs and subsequently decrease usage of our systems and services Further certain regulatory and legislative bodies have introduced or are considering requirements andor incentives to reduce energy consumption by certain dates Additionally technological advances driven by federal laws mandating new levels of energy efficiency in enduse electric and natural gas devices or other improvements in or applications of technology could lead to declines in per capita energy consumption Our future success will depend in part on our ability to anticipate and adapt to these technological changes in a costeffective manner and to offer on a timely basis reliable services that meet customer demands and evolving industry standards If we fail to adapt successfully to any technological change or obsolescence fail to obtain access to important technologies or incur significant expenditures in adapting to technological change or if implemented technology does not operate as anticipated our businesses operating results financial condition and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected Our or Enables potential business strategies and strategic initiatives including merger and acquisition activities and the disposition of assets or businesses may not be completed or perform as expected From time to time we and Enable have made and may continue to make acquisitions or divestitures of businesses and assets form joint ventures or undertake restructurings However suitable acquisition candidates or potential buyers may not continue to be available on terms and conditions we or Enable as the case may be find acceptable or the expected benefits of completed acquisitions may not be realized fully or at all or may not be realized in the anticipated timeframe If we or Enable are unable to make acquisitions or if those acquisitions do not perform as anticipated our and Enables future growth may be adversely affected 43 Any completed or future acquisitions involve substantial risks including the following  acquired businesses or assets may not produce revenues earnings or cash flow at anticipated levels  acquired businesses or assets could have environmental permitting or other problems for which contractual protections prove inadequate  we or Enable may assume liabilities that were not disclosed to us that exceed our estimates or for which our rights to indemnification from the seller are limited  we or Enable may be unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully and realize anticipated economic operational and other benefits in a timely manner which could result in substantial costs and delays or other operational technical or financial problems and  acquisitions or the pursuit of acquisitions could disrupt our or Enables ongoing businesses distract management divert resources and make it difficult to maintain current business standards controls and procedures We are involved in numerous legal proceedings the outcomes of which are uncertain and resolutions adverse to us could negatively affect our financial results The Registrants are subject to numerous legal proceedings the most significant of which are summarized in Note 16 to the Registrants respective consolidated financial statements With respect to the Merger in July 2018 seven separate lawsuits were filed against Vectren and the individual directors of Vectrens Board of Directors in the US District Court for the Southern District of Indiana These lawsuits allege violations of Sections 14a of the Exchange Act and SEC Rule 14a9 on the grounds that the Proxy Statement filed on June 18 2018 was materially incomplete because it omitted material information concerning the Merger The lawsuits also seek certification as class actions In August 2018 the seven lawsuits were consolidated and the Court denied the plaintiffs request for a preliminary injunction The plaintiffs filed their Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint on October 29 2018 which Defendants have moved to dismiss and which motion remains pending On December 28 2018 two plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their lawsuits The defendants believe that the allegations asserted are without merit and intend to vigorously defend themselves against the claims raised Litigation is subject to many uncertainties and the Registrants cannot predict the outcome of all matters with assurance Final resolution of these matters may require additional expenditures over an extended period of time that may be in excess of established insurance or reserves and may have a material adverse effect on the Registrants financial results We are exposed to risks related to reduction in energy consumption due to factors including unfavorable economic conditions in our service territories Our businesses are affected by reduction in energy consumption due to factors including economic climate in our service territories energy efficiency initiatives and use of alternative technologies which could impact our ability to grow our customer base and our rate of growth Growth in customer accounts and growth of customer usage each directly influence demand for electricity and the need for additional delivery facilities Customer growth and customer usage are affected by a number of factors outside our control such as mandated energy efficiency measures demandside management goals distributed generation resources and economic and demographic conditions such as population changes job and income growth housing starts new business formation and the overall level of economic activity Declines in demand for electricity as a result of economic downturns in Houston Electrics and Indiana Electrics regulated electric service territories will reduce overall sales and lessen cash flows especially as industrial customers reduce production and therefore consumption of electricity Although Houston Electrics and Indiana Electrics transmission and distribution businesses are subject to regulated allowable rates of return and recovery of certain costs under periodic adjustment clauses overall declines in electricity sold as a result of economic downturn or recession could reduce revenues and cash flows thereby diminishing results of operations Additionally prolonged economic downturns that negatively impact results of operations and cash flows could result in future material impairment charges to writedown the carrying value of certain assets including goodwill to their respective fair values 44 For example Houston Electrics business is largely concentrated in Houston Texas where a higher percentage of employment is tied to the energy sector relative to other regions of the country Although Houston Texas has a diverse economy employment in the energy industry remains important with overall Houston employment growing at a moderate rate in 2018 Further the operations of Vectrens utility businesses are concentrated in central and southern Indiana and westcentral Ohio and are therefore impacted by changes in the Midwest economy in general and changes in particular industries concentrated in the Midwest These industries include automotive assembly parts and accessories feed flour and grain processing metal castings plastic products gypsum products electrical equipment metal specialties glass and steel finishing pharmaceutical and nutritional products gasoline and oil products ethanol and coal mining In the event economic conditions further decline the respective rates of growth in Houston Indiana and the other areas in which we operate may also deteriorate Changing market conditions including changing regulation changes in market prices of oil or other commodities or changes in government regulation and assistance may cause certain industrial customers to reduce or cease production and thereby decrease consumption of natural gas andor electricity Increases in customer defaults or delays in payment due to liquidity constraints could negatively impact our cash flows and financial condition Some or all of these factors could result in a lack of growth or decline in customer demand for electricity or number of customers and may result in our failure to fully realize anticipated benefits from significant capital investments and expenditures which could have a material adverse effect on their financial position results of operations and cash flows Our businesses may be adversely affected by the intentional misconduct of our employees We are committed to living our core values of safety integrity accountability initiative and respect and complying with all applicable laws and regulations Despite that commitment and our efforts to prevent misconduct it is possible for employees to engage in intentional misconduct fail to uphold our core values and violate laws and regulations for individual gain through contract or procurement fraud misappropriation bribery or corruption fraudulent relatedparty transactions and serious breaches of our Ethics and Compliance Code and Standards of ConductBusiness Ethics policy among other policies If such intentional misconduct by employees should occur it could result in substantial liability higher costs increased regulatory scrutiny and negative public perceptions any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows Item 1B Unresolved Staff Comments None Item 2
