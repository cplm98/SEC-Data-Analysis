newest solar array which was approved by the IURC in 2018 consists of approximately 150000 solar panels distributed across 300 acres along Indiana State Road 545 between Troy and New Boston Indiana Construction of the 50 MW universal solar array was nearing completion at the end of 2020 and the project was placed in service for southwestern Indiana electric customers in early 2021 Coal Purchases Coal for coalfired generating stations has been supplied from operators of nearby coal mines as there are substantial coal reserves in the southern Indiana area Approximately 20 million tons were purchased for generating electricity during 2020 Indiana Electrics coal inventory was approximately 707000 tons as of December 31 2020 The average cost of coal per ton purchased and delivered in 2020 was 5073 Another 173000 tons are stored offsite to be shipped when plant inventory is reduced Since August 2014 Indiana Electric has purchased substantially all of its coal from Sunrise Coal LLC Firm Purchase Supply As part of its power portfolio Indiana Electric is a 15 shareholder in the OVEC and based on its participation in the ICPA between OVEC and its shareholder companies many of whom are regulated electric utilities Indiana Electric has the right to 15 of OVECs generating capacity output which as of December 31 2020 was approximately 32 MWs Per the ICPA Indiana Electric is charged demand charges which are based on OVECs operating expenses including its financing costs Those demand charges are available to pass through to customers under Indiana Electrics fuel adjustment clause Under the ICPA and while OVECs plants are operating Indiana Electric is severally responsible for its share of OVECs debt obligations Based on OVECs current financing as of September 30 2020 Indiana Electrics 15 share of OVECs debt obligation equates to between 19 million and 24 million depending on revolving capacity commitments Moodys rates OVEC one notch below investment grade with a positive outlook Fitch continues to rate OVEC as investment grade with a stable outlook SP withdrew its ratings on January 9 2020 at OVECs request In 2020 Indiana Electric purchased approximately 116 GWh from OVEC If a default were to occur by a member any reallocation of the existing debt requires consent of the remaining ICPA participants If any such reallocation were to occur Indiana Electric would expect to recover any related costs through the fuel adjustment clause as it does currently for its 15 share In July 2019 House Bill 6 was enacted in Ohio which provides financial support to the members of OVEC serving Ohio customers although Indiana Electric does not serve customers in Ohio In July 2020 an investigation led by the US Attorneys Office resulted in a federal grand jury indictment of the Speaker of the Ohio House of Representatives among other individuals in connection with a racketeering conspiracy involving the adoption of House Bill 6 In light of the allegations in the indictment proposed legislation has been introduced that would repeal House Bill 6 The outcome of the US Attorneys Office investigation and its impact on House Bill 6 is unknown at this time If the provisions of House Bill 6 are ultimately eliminated it is unclear whether and in what form the Ohio General Assembly would pass new legislation addressing similar issues which could repeal subsidies associated with House Bill 6 In April 2008 Indiana Electric executed a capacity contract with Benton County Wind Farm LLC to purchase as much as 30 MW from a wind farm located in Benton County Indiana with IURC approval The contract expires in 2029 Indiana Electric purchased approximately 76 GWh under this contract in 2020 In December 2009 Indiana Electric executed a 20year power purchase agreement with Fowler Ridge II Wind Farm LLC to purchase as much as 50 MW of energy from a wind farm located in Benton and Tippecanoe Counties in Indiana with the approval of the IURC Indiana

Time markets and procures power for its retail customers at Locational Marginal Price as determined by the MISO market MISOrelated purchase and sale transactions are recorded using settlement information provided by the MISO These purchase and sale transactions are accounted for on at least a net hourly position During 2020 in intervals when purchases from the MISO were in excess of generation sold to the MISO the net purchases were 742 GWh During the year ended December 31 2020 in intervals when sales to the MISO were in excess of purchases from the MISO the net sales were 385 GWh 5 Interconnections As of December 31 2020 Indiana Electric had interconnections with Louisville Gas and Electric Company Duke Energy Shared Services Inc Indianapolis Power  Light Company Hoosier Energy Rural Electric Cooperative Inc and Big Rivers Electric Corporation providing the ability to simultaneously interchange approximately 900 MW during peak load periods Indiana Electric as required as a member of the MISO has turned over operational control of the interchange facilities and its own transmission assets to the MISO Indiana Electric in conjunction with the MISO must operate the bulk electric transmission system in accordance with NERC Reliability Standards As a result interchange capability varies based on regional transmission system configuration generation dispatch seasonal facility ratings and other factors Indiana Electric is in compliance with reliability standards promulgated by the NERC Competition There are no other electric transmission and distribution utilities in Indiana Electrics service area Indiana Electric is a vertically integrated utility that owns the generation transmission and distribution components of a utility For another provider of

governmental agencies including the regulations described below The following discussion is based on regulation in the Registrants businesses and CenterPoint Energys investment in Enable as of December 31 2020 Federal Energy Regulatory Commission The FERC has jurisdiction under the NGA and the NGPA as amended to regulate the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce and natural gas sales for resale in interstate commerce that are not first sales The FERC regulates among other things the construction of pipeline and related facilities used in the transportation and storage of natural gas in interstate commerce including the extension expansion or abandonment of these facilities The FERC has authority to prohibit market manipulation in connection with FERCregulated transactions to conduct audits and investigations and to impose significant civil penalties up to approximately 13 million per day per violation subject to periodic adjustment to account for inflation for statutory violations and violations of the FERCs rules or orders Indiana Electric is a public utility under the FPA and is subject to regulation by the FERC The FERC regulates among other things the transmission and wholesale sales of electricity in interstate commerce mergers acquisitions and corporate transactions by electricity companies energy markets reliability standards and the issuance of shortterm debt The FERC also has authority to impose significant civil penalties up to approximately 13 million per day per violation subject to periodic adjustment to account for inflation for statutory violations and violations of the FERCs rules or orders Houston Electric is not a public utility under the FPA and therefore is not generally regulated by the FERC although certain of its transactions are subject to limited FERC jurisdiction The FERC has certain responsibilities with respect to ensuring the reliability of electric transmission service including

for payment of fees these franchises give Houston Electric the right to use the streets and public rightsofway of these municipalities to construct operate and maintain its transmission and distribution system and to use that system to conduct its electric delivery business and for other purposes that the franchises permit The terms of the franchises with various expiration dates typically range from 30 to 40 years Houston Electrics distribution rates charged to REPs for residential and small commercial customers are primarily based on amounts of energy delivered whereas distribution rates for a majority of large commercial and industrial customers are primarily based on peak demand All REPs in Houston Electrics service area pay the same rates and other charges for transmission and distribution services This regulated delivery charge includes the transmission and distribution rate which includes municipal franchise fees a distribution recovery mechanism for recovery of incremental distributioninvested capital above that which is already reflected in the base distribution rate a nuclear decommissioning charge associated with decommissioning the South Texas nuclear generating facility an EECRF charge and charges associated with securitization of regulatory assets stranded costs and restoration costs relating to Hurricane Ike Transmission rates charged to distribution companies are based on amounts of energy transmitted under postage stamp rates that do not vary with the distance the energy is being transmitted All distribution companies in ERCOT pay Houston Electric the same rates and other charges for transmission services With the IURCs approval Indiana Electric is a member of the MISO a FERCapproved regional transmission organization The MISO serves the electrical transmission needs of much of the midcontinent region and maintains operational control over Indiana Electrics electric transmission and generation facilities as well as those of other utilities in the region Indiana Electric is an active participant in the MISO energy markets bidding its owned generation into the Day Ahead and Real Time markets and procuring power for its retail customers at Locational Marginal Pricing as determined by the MISO market Indiana Electric also receives transmission revenue that results from other members use of Indiana Electrics transmission system Generally these transmission revenues along with costs charged by the MISO are considered components of base rates and any variance from that included in base rates is recovered from or refunded to retail customers through tracking mechanisms For a discussion of certain of Houston Electrics and Indiana Electrics ongoing regulatory proceedings see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Regulatory Matters in Item 7 of Part II of this report which discussion is incorporated herein by reference State and Local Regulation  Electric Generation CenterPoint Energy Indiana Electric owns and operates 1000 MW of coalfired generation 163 MW of gasfired generation and 4 MW of solar generation Indiana Electrics newest solar array which was approved by the IURC in 2018 consists of approximately 150000 solar panels distributed across 300 acres along Indiana State Road 545 between Troy and New Boston Indiana Construction of the 50 MW universal solar array was nearing completion at the end of 2020 and the project was placed in service for southwestern Indiana electric customers in early 2021 Indiana Electric also is party to two purchase power agreements entitling it to the delivery of up to 80 MW of electricity produced by wind turbines The energy and capacity secured from Indiana Electrics available generation resources are utilized primarily to serve the needs of retail electric customers residing within Indiana Electrics franchised service territory Costs of operating Indiana Electrics generation facilities are recovered through IURCapproved base rates as well as periodic rate recovery mechanisms including the CECA DSMA ECA FAC MCRA RCRA Mechanism and TDSIC Costs that are deemed unreasonable or imprudent by the IURC may not be recoverable through retail electric rates Indiana Electric also receives revenues from the MISO to compensate it for benefits the generation facilities provide to the transmission system Proceeds from the sales of energy from Indiana Electrics generation facilities that exceed the requirements of retail customers are shared by Indiana Electric and retail electric customers The generation facilities owned and operated by Indiana Electric are subject to various environmental regulations enforced by the EPA and the IDEM Operation of Indiana Electrics generation facilities are subject to regulation by the EPA and the IDEM as it pertains to the discharge of constituents from the generation facilities For further discussion see Our Business  Environmental Matters below 11 State and Local Regulation  Natural Gas CenterPoint Energy and CERC In almost all communities in which CenterPoint Energys and CERCs Natural Gas provides natural gas distribution services they operate under franchises certificates or licenses obtained from state and local authorities The original terms of the franchises with various expiration dates typically range from 20 to 30 years although franchises in Arkansas are perpetual CenterPoint Energys and CERCs Natural Gas expects to be able to renew expiring franchises In most cases franchises to provide natural gas utility services are not exclusive Substantially all of CenterPoint Energys and CERCs Natural Gas is subject to costofservice rate regulation by the relevant state public utility commissions and in Texas by those municipalities that have retained original jurisdiction In certain of the jurisdictions in which they operate CenterPoint Energys and CERCs Natural Gas has annual rate adjustment mechanisms that provide for changes in rates dependent upon certain changes in invested capital earned returns on equity or actual margins realized For a discussion of certain of CenterPoint Energys and CERCs Natural Gas ongoing regulatory proceedings see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Regulatory Matters in Item 7 of Part II of this report which discussion is incorporated herein by reference Department of Transportation CenterPoint Energy and CERC We are subject to regulation by PHMSA under the NGPSA and the HLPSA The NGPSA delegated to PHMSA through DOT the authority to regulate gas pipelines The HLPSA delegated to PHMSA through DOT the authority to develop prescribe and enforce federal safety standards for the transportation of hazardous liquids by pipeline Every four years PHMSA is up for reauthorization by Congress and with that reauthorization comes changes to the legislative requirements that Congress sets forth for the oversight of natural gas and hazardous liquid pipelines In 2020 the Pipes Act was enacted The Pipes Act reauthorized PHMSA through 2023 and imposed a few new mandates on the agency The law establishes a PHMSA technology pilot authorizes a new idled pipe operating status and contains process protections for operators during PHMSA enforcement proceedings There are no selfenacting portions of this act that impact our assets In January 2021 PHMSA published a final rule amending the federal Pipeline Safety Regulations to ease regulatory burdens on the construction operation and maintenance of gas transmission distribution and gathering systems However because the PSR Amendments have not yet gone into effect the Biden administration may review the PSR Amendments and potentially take steps to revise or revoke them It is uncertain whether the PSR Amendments will go into effect as finalized and what effects the PSR Amendments may have on our operations CenterPoint Energy and CERC anticipate that compliance with PHMSAs regulations performance of the remediation activities by CenterPoint Energys and CERCs Natural Gas and intrastate pipelines and verification of records on maximum allowable operating pressure will continue to require increases in both capital expenditures and operating costs The level of expenditures will depend upon several factors including age location and operating pressures of the facilities In particular the cost of compliance with the DOTs integrity management rules will depend on integrity testing and the repairs found to be necessary by such testing Changes to the amount of pipe subject to integrity management whether by expansion of the definition of the type of areas subject to integrity management procedures or of the applicability of such procedures outside of those defined areas may also affect the costs incurred Implementation by PHMSA of the PIPES Act acts reauthorizing PHMSA or other future acts may result in other regulations or the reinterpretation of existing regulations that could impact compliance costs In addition CenterPoint Energy and CERC may be subject to the DOTs enforcement actions and penalties if they fail to comply with pipeline regulations Midstream Investments  Rate and Other Regulation CenterPoint Energy Federal state and local regulation of pipeline gathering and transportation services may affect certain aspects of Enables business and the market for its products and services as discussed below Interstate Natural Gas Pipeline Regulation Enables interstate pipeline systemsEGT MRT and SESHare subject to regulation by the FERC and are considered natural gas companies under the NGA Under the NGA the rates for service on Enables interstate facilities must be just and reasonable and not unduly discriminatory Rate and tariff changes for these facilities can only be implemented upon approval by the FERC Enables interstate pipelines business operations may be affected by changes in the demand for natural gas the 12 available supply and relative price of natural gas in the Midcontinent and Gulf Coast natural gas supply regions and general economic conditions Market Behavior Rules Posting and Reporting Requirements The EPAct of 2005 amended the NGA to i prohibit market manipulation by any entity ii direct the FERC to facilitate market transparency in the market for the sale or transportation of physical natural gas in interstate commerce and iii significantly increase the penalties for violations of the NGA the NGPA and FERC rules regulations or orders thereunder The antimanipulation rules apply to interstate gas pipelines and storage companies and intrastate gas pipelines and storage companies that provide interstate services such as Section 311 service as well as otherwise nonjurisdictional entities to the extent the activities are conducted in connection with gas sales purchases or transportation subject to FERC jurisdiction The antimanipulation rules do not apply to activities that relate only to intrastate or other nonjurisdictional transactions As a result of the EPAct of 2005 the FERC has the authority to impose civil penalties for violations of these statutes and FERC rules regulations and orders up to approximately 13 million per day per violation Intrastate Natural Gas Pipeline and Storage Regulation Intrastate natural gas transportation is largely regulated by the state in which the transportation takes place An intrastate natural gas pipeline system may transport natural gas in interstate commerce provided that the rates terms and conditions of such transportation service comply with Section 311 of the NGPA and Part 284 of the FERCs regulations Rates for service pursuant to Section 311 of the NGPA are generally subject to review and approval by the FERC at least once every five years Failure to observe the service limitations applicable to transportation services provided under Section 311 failure to comply with the rates approved by the FERC for Section 311 service or failure to comply with the terms and conditions of service established in the pipelines FERCapproved Statement of Operating Conditions could result in the assertion of federal NGA jurisdiction by the FERC andor the imposition of administrative civil and criminal penalties as described under Market Behavior Rules Posting and Reporting Requirements above Natural Gas Gathering and Processing Regulation Section 1b of the NGA exempts natural gas gathering facilities from the jurisdiction of the FERC Although the FERC has not made formal determinations with respect to all of the facilities Enable considers to be natural gas gathering facilities Enable believes that its natural gas pipelines meet the traditional tests that the FERC has used to determine that a pipeline is a natural gas gathering pipeline and is therefore not subject to FERC jurisdiction The distinction however has been the subject of substantial litigation and the FERC determines whether facilities are natural gas gathering facilities on a casebycase basis so the classification and regulation of Enables gathering facilities is subject to change based on future determinations by the FERC the courts or Congress If FERC were to consider the status of an individual facility and determine that the facility andor services provided by it are not exempt from FERC regulation under the NGA and that the facility provides interstate service then the rates for and terms and conditions of services provided by such facility would be subject to regulation by FERC under the NGA or the NGPA States may regulate gathering pipelines State regulation of natural gas gathering facilities generally includes various safety environmental and in some circumstances antidiscrimination requirements and in some instances complaintbased rate regulation Enables natural gas gathering operations may be subject to ratable take and common purchaser statutes in the states in which they operate Enables gathering operations could be adversely affected should they be subject in the future to the application of state or federal regulation of rates and services Enables natural gas gathering operations could also be subject to additional safety and operational regulations relating to the design construction testing operation replacement and maintenance of gathering facilities CenterPoint Energy cannot predict what effect if any such changes might have on Enables operations but the industry could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased costs depending on future legislative and regulatory changes Interstate Crude Oil Gathering Regulation Enables crude oil gathering systems in the Williston Basin transport crude oil in interstate commerce Crude oil gathering pipelines that transport crude oil in interstate commerce may be regulated as common carriers by the FERC under the ICA the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and the rules and regulations promulgated under those laws The ICA and FERC regulations require that rates for interstate service pipelines that transport crude oil and refined petroleum products collectively referred to as petroleum pipelines and certain other liquids be just and reasonable and nondiscriminatory or not confer any undue 13 preference upon any shipper FERC regulations also require interstate common carrier petroleum pipelines to file with the FERC and publicly post tariffs stating their interstate transportation rates and terms and conditions of service Intrastate Crude Oil and Condensate Gathering Regulation Enables crude oil and condensate gathering system in the Anadarko Basin is located in Oklahoma and is subject to limited regulation by the OCC Crude oil and condensate gathering systems are common carriers under Oklahoma law and are prohibited from unjust or unlawful discrimination in favor of one customer over another Additional rules and legislation pertaining to these matters are considered or adopted from time to time Enables crude oil and condensate gathering results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected should they be subject in the future to the application of state or federal regulation of rates and services Safety and Health Regulation Enables pipeline facilities are subject to regulation under federal pipeline safety statutes and comparable state statutes Federal pipeline safety statutes include the NGPSA which provides for safety requirements in the design construction operation and maintenance of natural gas pipeline facilities and the HLPSA which provides for safety requirements for the design construction operation and maintenance of hazardous liquids pipelines facilities including NGL and crude oil pipelines Enable is also regulated under federal pipeline safety statutes by DOT through PHMSA PHMSA sets and enforces pipeline safety regulations and standards PHMSAs enforcement authority includes the ability to assess civil penalties for violations of pipeline safety regulations Enable incurs significant costs in complying with federal and state pipeline safety laws and regulations and otherwise administering its pipeline safety program ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The following discussion is based on environmental matters in the Registrants businesses as of December 31 2020 The Registrants operations and the operations of Enable are subject to stringent and complex laws and regulations pertaining to the environment As an owner or operator of natural gas pipelines distribution systems and storage electric transmission and distribution systems steam electric generation systems and the facilities that support these systems the Registrants must comply with these laws and regulations at the federal state and local levels These laws and regulations can restrict or impact the Registrants business activities in many ways including but not limited to  restricting the way the Registrants can handle or dispose of wastes including wastewater discharges and air emissions  limiting or prohibiting construction activities in sensitive areas such as wetlands coastal regions or areas inhabited by endangered species  requiring remedial action and monitoring to mitigate environmental conditions caused by the Registrants operations or attributable to former operations  enjoining the operations of facilities with permits issued pursuant to such environmental laws and regulations and  impacting the demand for the Registrants services by directly or indirectly affecting the use or price of fossil fuels including but not limited to natural gas To comply with these requirements the Registrants may need to spend substantial amounts and devote other resources from time to time to among other activities  construct or acquire new facilities and equipment  acquire permits for facility operations or purchase emissions allowances  modify upgrade or replace existing and proposed equipment and  decommission or remediate waste management areas fuel storage facilities and other locations Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative civil and criminal enforcement measures including the assessment of monetary penalties revocation of permits the imposition of remedial actions and monitoring and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations Certain environmental statutes impose strict joint and several liability for costs required to assess clean up and restore sites where hazardous substances have been stored disposed or released Moreover it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury andor property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other waste products into the environment Increasingly environmental regulation has resulted in more restrictions and limitations on activities that may impact the environment There can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation and monitoring and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts currently anticipated The 14 Registrants try to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and plan accordingly to maintain compliance with changing environmental laws and regulations Based on current regulatory requirements and interpretations the Registrants do not believe that compliance with federal state or local environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on their business financial position results of operations or cash flows In addition the Registrants believe that their current environmental remediation activities will not materially interrupt or diminish their operational ability The Registrants cannot assure you that future events such as changes in existing laws the promulgation of new laws or the development or discovery of new facts or conditions will not cause them to incur significant costs The following is a discussion of material current environmental and safety issues laws and regulations that relate to the Registrants operations The Registrants believe that they are in substantial compliance with these environmental laws and regulations Global Climate Change There is increasing attention being paid in the United States and worldwide to the issue of climate change As a result from time to time regulatory agencies have considered the modification of existing laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations addressing the emissions of GHG on the state federal or international level Some of the proposals would require industrial sources to meet stringent new standards that would require substantial reductions in GHG emissions CenterPoint Energys and CERCs revenues operating costs and capital requirements could be adversely affected as a result of any regulatory action that would require installation of new control technologies or a modification of their operations or would have the effect of reducing the consumption of natural gas One such rule the ACE Rule which was finalized by the EPA in 2019 would have required states to establish heat rate performance standards for steam electric generating facilities However on January 19 2021 the US District Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia struck down the ACE Rule The Biden administration recommitted the United States to the Paris Agreement which can be expected to drive a renewed regulatory push to require further GHG emission reductions from the energy sector Shortly after taking office in January 2021 President Biden issued a series of executive orders designed to address climate change President Biden has also signed an executive order requiring agencies to review environmental actions taken by the Trump administration which would have included the ACE Rule and the Biden administration has issued a memorandum to departments and agencies to refrain from proposing or issuing rules until a departmental or agency head appointed or designated by the Biden administration has reviewed and approved the rule Reentry into the Paris Agreement and President Bidens executive orders may result in the development of additional regulations or changes to existing regulations Houston Electric in contrast to some electric utilities does not generate electricity and thus is not directly exposed to the risk of high capital costs and regulatory uncertainties that face electric utilities that burn fossil fuels to generate electricity Nevertheless CenterPoint Energys and Houston Electrics revenues could be adversely affected to the extent any resulting regulatory action has the effect of reducing consumption of electricity by ultimate consumers within Houston Electrics service territory Likewise incentives to conserve energy or to use energy sources other than natural gas could result in a decrease in demand for the Registrants services Conversely regulatory actions that effectively promote the consumption of natural gas because of its lower emissions characteristics would be expected to beneficially affect CenterPoint Energy and CERC and their natural gasrelated businesses At this point in time however it would be speculative to try to quantify the magnitude of the impacts from possible new regulatory actions related to GHG emissions either positive or negative on the Registrants businesses On March 1 2020 CenterPoint Energy announced corporate carbon emission goals which are expected to be used to guide Indiana Electrics transition to a low carbon fleet and position Indiana Electric to comply with anticipated regulatory requirements to further reduce GHG emissions from its electric fleet To the extent climate changes may occur and such climate changes result in warmer temperatures in the Registrants or Enables service territories financial results from the Registrants and Enables businesses could be adversely impacted For example CenterPoint Energys and CERCs Natural Gas could be adversely affected through lower natural gas sales and Enables natural gas gathering processing and transportation and crude oil gathering businesses could experience lower revenues On the other hand warmer temperatures in CenterPoint Energys and Houston Electrics electric service territory may increase revenues from transmission and distribution and generation through increased demand for electricity for cooling Another possible result of climate change is more frequent and more severe weather events such as hurricanes tornadoes and flooding Since many of the Registrants facilities are located along or near the Gulf Coast increased or more severe hurricanes or tornadoes could increase costs to repair damaged facilities and restore service to customers When the Registrants cannot deliver electricity or natural gas to customers or customers cannot receive services the Registrants financial results can be impacted by lost revenues and they generally must seek approval from regulators to recover restoration costs To the extent the Registrants are unable to recover those costs or if higher rates resulting from recovery of such costs result in reduced demand for services the Registrants future financial results may be adversely impacted 15 Air Emissions The Registrants operations are subject to the federal Clean Air Act and comparable state laws and regulations These laws and regulations regulate emissions of air pollutants from various industrial sources including electric generating facilities and natural gas processing plants and compressor stations and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements Such laws and regulations may require preapproval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce air emissions or result in the increase of existing air emissions The Registrants may be required to obtain and strictly comply with air permits containing various emissions and operational limitations or utilize specific emission control technologies to limit emissions Failure to comply with these requirements could result in monetary penalties injunctions conditions or restrictions on operations and potentially criminal enforcement actions The Registrants may be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment in connection with obtaining and maintaining operating permits and approvals for air emissions Water Discharges The Registrants operations are subject to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 as amended also known as the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws and regulations These laws and regulations impose detailed requirements and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into waters of the United States The unpermitted discharge of pollutants including discharges resulting from a spill or leak incident is prohibited The Clean Water Act and regulations implemented thereunder also prohibit discharges of dredged and fill material into wetlands and other waters of the United States unless authorized by an appropriately issued permit Any unpermitted release of petroleum or other pollutants from the Registrants pipelines or facilities could result in fines or penalties as well as significant remedial obligations Waters of the United States Under the Obama administration the EPA promulgated a set of rules that included a comprehensive regulatory overhaul of defining waters of the United States for the purposes of determining federal jurisdiction The Trump administration signaled its intent to repeal and replace the Obamaera rules In accordance with this intent the EPA promulgated a rule in early 2018 that postponed the effectiveness of the Obamaera rules until 2020 Thereafter the EPA proposed a new set of rules that would narrow the Clean Water Acts jurisdiction which were finalized on April 21 2020 Environmental stakeholders and certain states have filed challenges to the new rule Shortly after taking office in January 2021 President Biden signed an executive order requiring agencies to review environmental actions taken by the Trump administration including the April 2020 rule but the nature and extent of any revisions to these rules that may be sought is uncertain at this time The potential impact of the litigation or further revisions to the waters of the United States regulations on the Registrants business liabilities compliance obligations or profits and revenues is uncertain at this time ELG In 2015 the EPA finalized revisions to the existing steam electric wastewater discharge standards which set more stringent wastewater discharge limits and effectively prohibited further wet disposal of coal ash in ash ponds These new standards are applied at the time of permit renewal and an affected facility must comply with the wastewater discharge limitations no later than December 31 2023 and the prohibition of wet sluicing of bottom ash no later than December 31 2025 In February 2019 the IURC approved Indiana Electrics ELG compliance plan for its FB Culley Generating Station and Indiana Electric is currently finalizing its ELG compliance plan for the remainder of its affected units as part of its ongoing IRP process Cooling Water Intake Structures Section 316 of the federal Clean Water Act requires steam electric generating facilities use best technology available to minimize adverse environmental impacts on a body of water In May 2014 the EPA finalized a regulation requiring installation of best technology available to mitigate impingement and entrainment of aquatic species in cooling water intake structures Indiana Electric is currently completing the required ecological studies and anticipates timely compliance in 20212022 Hazardous Waste The Registrants operations generate wastes including some hazardous wastes that are subject to the federal RCRA and comparable state laws which impose detailed requirements for the handling storage treatment transport and disposal of hazardous and solid waste RCRA currently exempts many natural gas gathering and field processing wastes from classification as hazardous waste Specifically RCRA excludes from the definition of hazardous waste waters produced and other wastes associated with the exploration development or production of crude oil and natural gas However these oil and gas exploration 16 and production wastes are still regulated under state law and the less stringent nonhazardous waste requirements of RCRA Moreover ordinary industrial wastes such as paint wastes waste solvents laboratory wastes and waste compressor oils may be regulated as hazardous waste The transportation of natural gas in pipelines may also generate some hazardous wastes that would be subject to RCRA or comparable state law requirements Coal Ash Indiana Electric has three ash ponds two at the FB Culley facility Culley East and Culley West and one at the AB Brown facility In 2015 the EPA finalized its CCR Rule which regulates coal ash as nonhazardous material under the RCRA The final rule allows beneficial reuse of ash and the majority of the ash generated by Indiana Electrics generating plants will continue to be beneficially reused The EPA continues to propose amendments to the CCR Rule however under the CCR Rule as it is currently in effect Indiana Electric is required to perform integrity assessments including ground water monitoring at its FB Culley and AB Brown generating stations The ground water studies are necessary to determine the remaining service life of the ponds and whether a pond must be retrofitted with liners or closed in place Preliminary groundwater monitoring indicates potential groundwater impacts very close to Indiana Electrics ash impoundments and further analysis is ongoingThe CCR Rule required companies to complete location restriction determinations by October 18 2018 Indiana Electric completed its evaluation and determined that one FB Culley pond Culley East and the AB Brown pond fail the aquifer placement location restriction As a result of this failure Indiana Electric is required to cease disposal of new ash in the ponds and commence closure of the ponds by April 11 2021 Indiana Electric plans to seek extensions available under the CCR Rule that would allow Indiana Electric to continue to use the ponds through October 15 2023 The inability to take these extensions may result in increased and potentially significant operational costs in connection with the accelerated implementation of an alternative ash disposal system or adversely impact Indiana Electrics future operations Failure to comply with these requirements could also result in an enforcement proceeding including the imposition of fines and penalties The Culley West pond was closed under CCR provisions applicable to inactive ponds and closure activities were completed in December 2020 For further discussion about Indiana Electrics ash ponds please see Note 16e to the consolidated financial statements Liability for Remediation CERCLA also known as Superfund and comparable state laws impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons responsible for the release of hazardous substances into the environment Classes of PRPs include the current and past owners or operators of sites where a hazardous substance was released and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances at offsite locations such as landfills Although petroleum as well as natural gas is expressly excluded from CERCLAs definition of a hazardous substance in the course of the Registrants ordinary operations they do from time to time generate wastes that may fall within the definition of a hazardous substance CERCLA authorizes the EPA and in some cases third parties to take action in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to recover the costs they incur from the responsible classes of persons Under CERCLA the Registrants could potentially be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up and restoring sites where hazardous substances have been released for damages to natural resources and for associated response and assessment costs including for the costs of certain health studies Liability for Preexisting Conditions For information about preexisting environmental matters please

that conducts all of its business operations through subsidiaries primarily Houston Electric CERC SIGECO Indiana Gas and VEDO CenterPoint Energy also owns interests in Enable The following along with any additional legal proceedings identified or incorporated by reference in Item 3 of this combined report on Form 10K summarizes the principal risk factors associated with the holding company the businesses conducted by its subsidiaries and its interests in Enable However additional risks and uncertainties either not presently known or not currently believed by management to be material may also adversely affect CenterPoint Energys businesses For other factors that may cause actual 20 results to differ from those indicated in any forwardlooking statement or projection contained in this combined report on Form 10K see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Certain Factors Affecting Future Earnings in Item 7 which should be read in conjunction with the risk factors contained in this Item 1A Carefully consider each of the risks described below including those relating to Houston Electric and CERC which along with CenterPoint Energy are collectively referred to as the Registrants Unless the context indicates otherwise where appropriate information relating to a specific registrant has been segregated and labeled as such and specific references to Houston Electric and CERC in this section also pertain to CenterPoint Energy In this combined report on Form 10K the terms our we and us are used as abbreviated references to CenterPoint Energy Inc together with its subsidiaries Risk Factors Associated with Our Consolidated Financial Condition CenterPoint Energy is a holding company with no operations or operating assets of its own As a result CenterPoint Energy depends on the performance of and distributions from its subsidiaries and from Enable to meet its payment obligations and to pay dividends on its common and preferred stock and provisions of applicable law or contractual restrictions could limit the amount of those distributions CenterPoint Energy derives all of its operating income from and holds all of its assets through its subsidiaries including its interests in Enable As a result CenterPoint Energy depends on the performance of and distributions from its subsidiaries and Enable to meet its payment obligations and to pay dividends on its common and preferred stock In general CenterPoint Energys subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to provide it with funds for its payment obligations whether by dividends distributions loans or otherwise In addition provisions of applicable law such as those limiting the legal sources of dividends limit CenterPoint Energys subsidiaries and Enables ability to make payments or other distributions to CenterPoint Energy and its subsidiaries or Enable could agree to contractual restrictions on their ability to make payments or other distributions Further Houston Electric has agreed to certain ringfencing measures to increase its financial separateness from CenterPoint Energy Further ringfencing measures could be imposed on Houston Electric in the future through legislation or PUCT rules or orders While current ringfencing measures have not impacted Houston Electrics ability to pay dividends to CenterPoint Energy the imposition of any additional ringfencing measures impacting CenterPoint Energys ability to receive dividends from Houston Electric could materially adversely affect CenterPoint Energys cash flows credit quality financial condition and results of operations CenterPoint Energys right to receive any assets of any subsidiary and therefore the right of its creditors to participate in those assets will be structurally subordinated to the claims of that subsidiarys creditors including trade creditors In addition even if CenterPoint Energy were a creditor of any subsidiary its rights as a creditor would be effectively subordinated to any security interest in the assets of that subsidiary and any indebtedness of the subsidiary senior to that held by CenterPoint Energy If we are unable to arrange future financings on acceptable terms our ability to finance our capital expenditures or refinance outstanding indebtedness could be limited Our businesses are capital intensive and we rely on various sources to finance our capital expenditures For example we depend on i longterm debt ii borrowings through our revolving credit facilities and for CenterPoint Energy and CERC commercial paper programs iii distributions from CenterPoint Energys interests in Enable and iv if market conditions permit issuances of additional shares of common or preferred stock by CenterPoint Energy We may also use such sources to refinance any outstanding indebtedness as it matures As of December 31 2020 CenterPoint Energy had 134 billion of outstanding indebtedness on a consolidated basis which includes 747 million of nonrecourse Securitization Bonds For information on outstanding indebtedness of Houston Electric and CERC as well as maturities through 2025 see Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements Our future financing activities may be significantly affected by among other things  general economic and capital market conditions  credit availability from financial institutions and other lenders  volatility or fluctuations in distributions from Enables units or volatility in Enables unit price  investor confidence in us and the markets in which we operate  the future performance of our and Enables businesses  integration of Vectrens businesses into CenterPoint Energy including technology systems  maintenance of acceptable credit ratings  market expectations regarding our future earnings and cash flows  our ability to access capital markets on reasonable terms  incremental collateral that may be required due to regulation of derivatives and  provisions of relevant securities laws 21 In addition our future financing activities may also be impacted by our ability to consummate the proposed sale of our Natural Gas businesses in Arkansas and Oklahoma For further information on the proposed sale see  Our potential business strategies and strategic initiatives including merger and acquisition activities and the disposition of assets or businesses may not be completed or perform as expected adversely affecting our financial condition results of operations and cash flows below With respect to impacts related to our investment in Enable see Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the recently announced Enable Merger The Registrants current credit ratings and any changes in credit ratings in 2020 and to date in 2021 are discussed in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Other Matters  Impact on Liquidity of a Downgrade in Credit Ratings in Item 7 of Part II of this report These credit ratings may not remain in effect for any given period of time and one or more of these ratings may be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency The Registrants note that these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy sell or hold their securities Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating Any future reduction or withdrawal of one or more of the Registrants credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on their ability to access capital on acceptable terms An impairment of goodwill longlived assets including intangible assets equity method investments and an impairment or fair value adjustment to CenterPoint Energys Enable Series A Preferred Unit investment could reduce our earnings Longlived assets including intangible assets with finite useful lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable During the year ended December 31 2020 CenterPoint Energy identified and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 185 million in the Indiana Electric reporting unit reducing the carrying value of the reporting unit to its fair value as of March 31 2020 See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further information For investments CenterPoint Energy accounts for under the equity method the impairment test considers whether the fair value of such investment as a whole not the underlying net assets has declined and whether that decline is other than temporary CenterPoint Energy identified and recorded an impairment during the year ended December 31 2020 based on the severity of the decline in Enables common unit price during the three months ended March 31 2020 due to the macroeconomic conditions related in part to the COVID19 pandemic combined with Enables announcement on April 1 2020 to reduce its quarterly distributions per common unit by 50 and the market outlook indicating excess supply of crude oil and natural gas and continued depressed crude oil and natural gas prices impacting the midstream oil and gas industry For further information regarding CenterPoint Energys impairment of its equity investment in Enable please see Notes 10 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements Should the annual goodwill impairment test or another periodic impairment test or an observable transaction including for the Series A Preferred Unit investment indicate the fair value of our assets is less than the carrying value we would be required to take a noncash charge to earnings with a correlative effect on equity and balance sheet leverage as measured by debt to total capitalization A sustained or severe decline in Enables common unit price could result in CenterPoint Energy recording impairment charges again in the future A noncash impairment charge or fair value adjustment could materially adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition If CenterPoint Energy redeems the ZENS prior to their maturity in 2029 its ultimate tax liability and redemption payments would result in significant cash payments which would adversely impact its cash flows Similarly a significant amount of exchanges of ZENS by ZENS holders could adversely impact CenterPoint Energys cash flows CenterPoint Energy has approximately 828 million principal amount of ZENS outstanding as of December 31 2020 CenterPoint Energy owns shares of ZENSRelated Securities equal to approximately 100 of the reference shares used to calculate its obligation to the holders of the ZENS CenterPoint Energy may redeem all of the ZENS at any time at a redemption amount per ZENS equal to the higher of the contingent principal amount per ZENS 56 million in the aggregate or 397 per ZENS as of December 31 2020 or the sum of the current market value of the reference shares attributable to one ZENS at the time of redemption In the event CenterPoint Energy redeems the ZENS in addition to the redemption amount it would be required to pay deferred taxes related to the ZENS CenterPoint Energys ultimate tax liability related to the ZENS and ZENSRelated Securities continues to increase by the amount of the tax benefit realized each year If the ZENS had been redeemed on December 31 2020 deferred taxes of approximately 471 million would have been payable in 2020 based on 2020 tax rates in effect In addition if all the shares of ZENSRelated Securities had been sold on December 31 2020 to fund the aggregate redemption amount capital gains taxes of approximately 159 million would have been payable in 2020 Similarly a significant amount of exchanges of ZENS by ZENS holders could adversely impact CenterPoint Energys cash flows This could happen if CenterPoint Energys creditworthiness were to drop or the market for the ZENS were to become illiquid or for some other reason While funds for the payment of cash upon exchange of ZENS could be obtained from the sale of the shares of ZENSRelated Securities that CenterPoint Energy owns or from other sources ZENS exchanges result in a cash outflow 22 because tax deferrals related to the ZENS and ZENSRelated Securities shares would typically cease when ZENS are exchanged and ZENSRelated Securities shares are sold Dividend requirements associated with CenterPoint Energys Series A Preferred Stock Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock subject it to certain risks CenterPoint Energy has issued 800000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock and 19550000 depositary shares each representing a 120th interest in a share of CenterPoint Energys Series B Preferred Stock which is expected to convert into Common Stock on September 1 2021 CenterPoint Energy has also issued 725000 shares of Series C Preferred Stock of which 625000 shares remain outstanding The Series C Preferred Stock are expected to convert to Common Stock on or around May 7 2021 Any future payments of cash dividends and the amount of any cash dividends CenterPoint Energy pays on its Series A Preferred Stock Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock will depend on among other things its financial condition capital requirements and results of operations and the ability of our subsidiaries and Enable to distribute cash to CenterPoint Energy as well as other factors that CenterPoint Energys Board of Directors or an authorized committee thereof may consider relevant Any failure to pay scheduled dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock when due could materially adversely impact our ability to access capital on acceptable terms and would likely have a material adverse impact on the market price of the Series A Preferred Stock the Series B Preferred Stock Common Stock and CenterPoint Energys debt securities and would prohibit CenterPoint Energy under the terms of the Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock from paying cash dividends on or repurchasing shares of Common Stock subject to limited exceptions until such time as CenterPoint Energy has paid all accumulated and unpaid dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock and the Series B Preferred Stock Further the terms of the Series A Preferred Stock and the Series B Preferred Stock provide that if dividends on any of the respective shares have not been declared and paid for the equivalent of three or more semiannual or six or more quarterly dividend periods whether or not for consecutive dividend periods the holders of such shares voting together as a single class with holders of any and all other series of CenterPoint Energys capital stock on parity with its Series A Preferred Stock or its Series B Preferred Stock as to the payment of dividends and amounts payable on liquidation dissolution or winding up of CenterPoint Energys affairs upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable will be entitled to vote for the election of a total of two additional members of CenterPoint Energys Board of Directors subject to certain terms and limitations Changes in the method of determining LIBOR or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate may adversely affect the cost of capital related to outstanding debt and other financial instruments and may adversely affect the cash distributions received from the Enable Series A Preferred Units LIBOR is the basic rate of interest widely used as a global reference for setting interest rates on variable rate loans and other securities Each of the Registrants credit and term loan facilities including certain facilities or financial instruments entered into by their subsidiaries use LIBOR as a reference rate Additionally on and after February 18 2021 Enable is expected to pay distributions on the Enable Series A Preferred Units with an annual rate equal to threemonth LIBOR plus 85 On July 27 2017 the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom announced that it would phase out LIBOR as a benchmark by the end of 2021 On November 30 2020 the Financial Conduct Authority announced its support for the extension of certain tenors of US dollar LIBOR until June 2023 as well as the replacement of LIBOR by the SOFR While this announcement extends the transition period to June 2023 the Federal Reserve concurrently issued a statement advising banks to stop new US dollar LIBOR issuances by the end of 2021 However because SOFR is a broad US Treasury repo financing rate that represents overnight secured funding transactions it differs fundamentally from LIBOR It is unclear whether other new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021 The future of LIBOR at this time remains uncertain and any changes in the methods by which LIBOR is determined or regulatory activity related to LIBORs phaseout could cause LIBOR to perform differently than in the past or cease to exist Changes in the method of calculating LIBOR or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative rate or benchmark may adversely affect interest rates and result in higher borrowing costs This could materially and adversely affect our results of operations cash flow and liquidity Each of the Registrants credit facilities provide for a mechanism to replace LIBOR with possible alternative benchmarks upon certain benchmark replacement events However we are still currently evaluating the impact of any such potential benchmark replacements or unavailability of LIBOR In addition the overall financial markets may be disrupted as a result of the phaseout or replacement of LIBOR Uncertainty as to the nature of such potential phaseout and alternative benchmark rates or disruption in the financial markets could materially and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 23 Risk Factors Affecting Electric Generation Transmission and Distribution Businesses CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric Rate regulation of Houston Electrics and Indiana Electrics businesses may delay or deny their ability to earn an expected return and fully recover their costs Houston Electrics rates are regulated by certain municipalities and the PUCT and Indiana Electrics rates are regulated by the IURC Their rates are set in comprehensive base rate proceedings ie general rate cases based on an analysis of their invested capital their expenses and other factors in a designated test year Each of these rate proceedings is subject to thirdparty intervention and appeal and the timing of a general base rate proceeding may be out of Houston Electrics and Indiana Electrics control For Houston Electric a general base rate proceeding is required 48 months from the date of the order setting rates in its most recent comprehensive rate proceeding unless the PUCT issues an order extending the deadline to file that general base rate proceeding For Indiana Electric a general base rate proceeding is required prior to the expiration of its TDSIC plan which expires on December 31 2023 Houston Electric and Indiana Electric can make no assurance that their respective base rate proceedings will result in favorable adjustments to their rates in full cost recovery or approval of other requested items including among other things capital structure and ROE Moreover these base rate proceedings have caused in certain instances and in the future could cause Houston Electric and Indiana Electric to recover their investments below their requested levels such as in the most recent Houston Electric general rate case below the national average for utilities or below recently approved levels for other utilities in their respective jurisdictions The rates that Houston Electric and Indiana Electric are allowed to charge may not match their costs at any given time a situation referred to as regulatory lag For Houston Electric and Indiana Electric several interim rate adjustment mechanisms have been implemented to reduce the effects of regulatory lag for example DCRF TCOS TDSIC DSMA and RCRA Mechanism although certain of these mechanisms do not provide for recovery of operations and maintenance expenses These adjustment mechanisms are subject to the applicable regulatory bodys approval and are subject to limitations that may reduce Houston Electrics and Indiana Electrics ability to adjust rates For further information on rate case proceedings and interim rate adjustment mechanisms see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Regulatory Matters in Item 7 of Part II of this report See also The February 2021 Winter Storm Event has caused severe disruptions to our customers and our markets in certain of our jurisdictions and could have a material adverse impact to our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity below for further information Houston Electric and Indiana Electric can make no assurance that filings for such mechanisms will result in favorable adjustments to rates or in full cost recovery Notwithstanding the application of such rate adjustment mechanisms the regulatory process by which rates are determined is subject to change as a result of the legislative process or rulemaking as the case may be and may not always be available or result in rates that will produce recovery of Houston Electrics and Indiana Electrics costs or enable them to earn an expected return Changes to the interim adjustment mechanisms could result in an increase in regulatory lag or otherwise impact Houston Electrics and Indiana Electrics ability to recover their costs in a timely manner Additionally inherent in the regulatory process is some level of risk that jurisdictional regulatory authorities may initiate investigations of the prudence of operating expenses incurred or capital investments made by Houston Electric or Indiana Electric and deny the full recovery of their cost of service in rates To the extent the regulatory process does not allow Houston Electric and Indiana Electric to make a full and timely recovery of appropriate costs their results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected Disruptions at power generation facilities owned by third parties or directives issued by regulatory authorities could interrupt Houston Electrics sales of transmission and distribution services and adversely affect its reputation results of operations financial condition and cash flows Houston Electric transmits and distributes to customers of REPs electric power that the REPs obtain from power generation facilities owned by third parties Houston Electric does not own or operate any power generation facilities In February 2021 the Texas electric system experienced an unprecedented power shortage due to extreme winter weather conditions The states power generation fell short of demand resulting in significant electricity outages across Texas including in Houston Electrics service territory See Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the February 2021 Winter Storm Event If power generation is disrupted or if power generation capacity is inadequate or if ERCOT issues directives to TDUs such as Houston Electric to implement controlled outages both of which recently occurred during the February 2021 Winter Weather Event Houston Electrics sales of transmission and distribution services may be diminished or interrupted and its reputation results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected See also The February 2021 Winter Storm Event has caused severe disruptions to our customers and our markets in certain of our jurisdictions and 24 could have a material adverse impact to our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity below for further information Houston Electrics receivables are primarily concentrated in a small number of REPs and any delay or default in such payments could adversely affect Houston Electrics cash flows financial condition and results of operations Houston Electrics receivables from the distribution of electricity are collected from REPs that supply the electricity Houston Electric distributes to their customers As of December 31 2020 Houston Electric did business with approximately 64 REPs Adverse economic conditions including the impact of COVID19 the February 2021 Winter Storm Event structural problems in the market served by ERCOT or financial difficulties of one or more REPs could impair the ability of these REPs to pay for Houston Electrics services or could cause them to delay such payments Houston Electric depends on these REPs to remit payments on a timely basis Applicable regulatory provisions require that customers be shifted to another REP or a provider of last resort if a REP cannot make timely payments Applicable PUCT regulations significantly limit the extent to which Houston Electric can apply normal commercial terms or otherwise seek credit protection from firms desiring to provide retail electric service in its service territory and Houston Electric thus remains at risk for payments related to services provided prior to the shift to another REP or the provider of last resort A significant portion of Houston Electrics billed receivables from REPs are from affiliates of NRG and Vistra Energy Corp Houston Electrics aggregate billed receivables balance from REPs as of December 31 2020 was 210 million Approximately 31 and 16 of this amount was owed by affiliates of NRG and Vistra Energy Corp respectively Any delay or default in payment by REPs could adversely affect Houston Electrics cash flows financial condition and results of operations If a REP were unable to meet its obligations it could consider among various options restructuring under the bankruptcy laws in which event such REP might seek to avoid honoring its obligations and claims might be made by creditors involving payments Houston Electric had received from such REP Indiana Electrics execution of its generation transition plan including its IRP and its regulated power supply operations are subject to various risks including timely recovery of capital investments increased costs and facility outages or shutdowns Indiana requires each electric utility to perform and submit an IRP every three years unless extended to the IURC that uses economic modeling to consider the costs and risks associated with available resource options to provide reliable electric service for the next 20year period on a periodic basis Indiana Electrics 2016 IRP modeling projected that the lowest cost and least risk generation portfolio to serve customers over the next 20 years involve retirement of a significant portion of its current generating fleet and replacing that generation capacity with other resources Implementation of Indiana Electrics IRP will likely require recovery of new capital investments as well as costs of retiring the current generation fleet including any remaining unrecovered costs of retired assets In February 2018 as part of its electric generation transition plan Indiana Electric received approval from the IURC to construct a 50 MW universal solar array and the plan to retrofit its largest most efficient coalfired generation unit Culley Unit 3 With respect to its 20192020 IRP submitted to the IURC in June 2020 Indiana Electric identified a preferred generation resource that includes the replacement of 730 MW of coalfired generation facilities with a significant portion composed of renewables including solar and wind supported by dispatchable natural gas combustion turbines including a pipeline to serve such natural gas generation as well as storage While the IURC does not approve or reject the IRP the process involves the issuance of a staff report that provides comments on the IRP Depending on comments received on the IRP the filing of any future requests for generating facilities could be delayed Further certain legislative activities such as a prohibition on the construction of new generation assets in excess of a set MW capacity similar to moratorium legislation introduced in 2019 and ultimately defeated or other legislation restricting or delaying new generation could negatively affect Indiana Electrics ability to construct new generation facilities and execution of its capital plan Even if a generation project is approved risks associated with the construction of any new generation exist including the ability to procure resources needed to build at a reasonable cost scarcity of resources and labor ability to appropriately estimate costs of new generation the effects of potential construction delays and cost overruns and the ability to meet capacity requirements Further there is no guarantee that the IURC will approve the requests included in any of Indiana Electrics future filed petitions relating to its IRP For further information on the IRP see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Regulatory Matters in Item 7 of Part II of this report Additionally Indiana Electrics generating facilities are subject to operational risks that could result in unscheduled plant outages unanticipated operation and maintenance expenses increased purchase power costs and inadvertent releases of coal ash andor other contaminants with a significant environmental impact These operational risks can arise from circumstances such as facility shutdowns or malfunctions due to equipment failure or operator error interruption of fuel supply or increased prices of fuel as contracts expire disruptions in the delivery of electricity inability to comply with regulatory or permit requirements labor disputes or natural disasters all of which could adversely affect Indiana Electrics business Further Indiana Electric currently relies on coal for substantially all of its generation capacity Currently its coal supply is purchased largely from a 25 single unrelated party and although the coal supply is under longterm contract the loss of this supplier or transportation interruptions could adversely affect Indiana Electrics results of operations financial condition and cash flows Houston Electric and Indiana Electric as a member of ERCOT and MISO respectively could be subject to higher costs for system improvements as well as fines or other sanctions as a result of FERC mandatory reliability standards Houston Electric and Indiana Electric are members of ERCOT and MISO respectively which serve the electric transmission needs of their applicable regions As a result of their respective participation in ERCOT and MISO Houston Electric and Indiana Electric do not have operational control over their transmission facilities and are subject to certain costs for improvements to these regional electric transmission systems In addition the FERC has jurisdiction with respect to ensuring the reliability of electric transmission service including transmission facilities owned by Houston Electric and other utilities within ERCOT and Indiana Electric and other utilities within MISO respectively The FERC has designated the NERC as the ERO to promulgate standards under FERC oversight for all owners operators and users of the bulk power system The FERC has approved the delegation by the NERC of authority for reliability in ERCOT to the Texas RE a Texas nonprofit corporation and for reliability in the portion of MISO that includes Indiana Electric to ReliabilityFirst Corporation a Delaware nonprofit corporation Compliance with mandatory reliability standards may subject Houston Electric and Indiana Electric to higher operating costs and may result in increased capital expenditures which may not be fully recoverable in rates In addition if Houston Electric or Indiana Electric were to be found to be in noncompliance with applicable mandatory reliability standards they could be subject to sanctions including substantial monetary penalties In connection with the February 2021 Winter Storm Event there have been calls for reform of the Texas electric market which if implemented could have material adverse impacts on Houston Electric Various governmental and regulatory agencies and other entities have called for or are conducting inquiries and investigations into the February 2021 Winter Storm Event and the efforts made by various entities to prepare for and respond to this event including the electricity generation shortfall issues Agencies and entities that may conduct or are conducting such inquiries investigations and other reviews include the United States Congress FERC NERC Texas RE ERCOT Texas government entities and officials such as the Texas Governors office the Texas Legislature the Texas Attorney General the PUCT the City of Houston and other municipal and county entities in Houston Electrics service area among other entities In addition to questions around preparation and response some federal and other officials as well as members of the public and media have called for reviews and reforms of the Texas electric market including whether it should continue to be governed by ERCOT or instead be subject to FERC jurisdiction and regulation by joining an ISO such as MISO as well as the division of the market between power generators TDUs such as Houston Electric and REPs There are significant uncertainties around these discussions and whether any market structure or governance changes will result therefrom but if any such reviews and reform efforts ultimately result in changes to how the Texas electric market is structured or regulated such changes could have a material adverse impact on Houston Electrics business results of operations and financial condition See The February 2021 Winter Storm Event has caused severe disruptions to our customers and our markets in certain of our jurisdictions and could have a material adverse impact to our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity below and Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements for further information Risk Factors Affecting Natural Gas Business CenterPoint Energy and CERC Rate regulation of Natural Gas may delay or deny its ability to earn an expected return and fully recover its costs Natural Gas rates are regulated by certain municipalities in Texas only and state commissions based on an analysis of Natural Gas invested capital expenses and other factors in a test year often either fully or partially historic in comprehensive base rate proceedings subject to periodic review and adjustment Each of these proceedings is subject to thirdparty intervention and appeal and the timing of a general base rate proceeding may be out of Natural Gas control Natural Gas has pending or anticipates the filing of rate cases in Indiana and Minnesota during 2021 Natural Gas can make no assurance that these respective base rate proceedings will result in favorable adjustments to its rates full cost recovery or approval of other requested items including among other things capital structure and ROE Moreover these base rate proceedings could cause Natural Gas to recover its investments at rates below its requested level below the national average for utilities or below recently approved levels for other utilities in those jurisdictions The rates that Natural Gas is allowed to charge may not match its costs at any given time resulting in what is referred to as regulatory lag Though several interim rate adjustment mechanisms have been approved by jurisdictional regulatory authorities and implemented by Natural Gas to reduce the effects of regulatory lag for example GRIP FRP CSIA and DRR such adjustment mechanisms are subject to the applicable regulatory bodys approval which we cannot assure would be 26 approved and are subject to certain limitations that may reduce or otherwise impede Natural Gas ability to adjust its rates or result in rates below those requested by Natural Gas Natural Gas can make no assurance that filings for such mechanisms will result in favorable adjustments to rates Notwithstanding the application of the rate mechanisms discussed above the regulatory process by which rates are determined is subject to change as a result of the legislative process or rulemaking as the case may be and may not always be available or result in rates that will produce recovery of Natural Gas costs or enable Natural Gas to earn an expected return Changes to the interim adjustment mechanisms could result in an increase in regulatory lag or otherwise impact Natural Gas ability to recover its costs in a timely manner Additionally inherent in the regulatory process is some level of risk that jurisdictional regulatory authorities may initiate investigations of the prudence of operating expenses incurred or capital investments made by Natural Gas and deny the full recovery of Natural Gas cost of service or the full recovery of incurred natural gas costs in rates To the extent the regulatory process does not allow Natural Gas to make a full and timely recovery of appropriate costs its results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected For further information on rate case proceedings and interim rate adjustment mechanisms see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Regulatory Matters in Item 7 of Part II of this report Unlike CERC Indiana Gas SIGECOs natural gas distribution business and VEDO must seek approval by the IURC and PUCO as applicable for longterm financing authority This authority allows these utilities the flexibility to enter into various financing arrangements In the event that the IURC or PUCO do not approve these utilities respective financing authorities they may not be able to fully execute their financing plans and their respective financial conditions results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected Access to natural gas supplies and pipeline transmission and storage capacity are essential components of reliable service for Natural Gas customers Natural Gas depends on thirdparty service providers to maintain an adequate supply of natural gas and for available storage and intrastate and interstate pipeline capacity to satisfy its customers needs all of which are critical to system reliability Substantially all of Natural Gas natural gas supply is purchased from intrastate and interstate pipelines If Natural Gas is unable to secure an independent natural gas supply of its own or through its affiliates or if thirdparty service providers fail to timely deliver natural gas to meet Natural Gas requirements the resulting decrease in natural gas supply in Natural Gas service territories could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations cash flows and financial condition Additionally a significant disruption whether through reduced intrastate and interstate pipeline transmission or storage capacity or other events affecting natural gas supply including but not limited to operational failures hurricanes tornadoes floods severe winter weather conditions acts of terrorism or cyberattacks or changes in legislative or regulatory requirements could also adversely affect Natural Gas businesses Further to the extent that Natural Gas natural gas requirements cannot be met through access to or continued use of existing natural gas infrastructure or if additional infrastructure including onshore and offshore exploration and production facilities gathering and processing systems and pipeline and storage capacity is not constructed at a rate that satisfies demand then Natural Gas operations could be negatively affected For additional risks related to the February 2021 Winter Storm Event see The February 2021 Winter Storm Event has caused severe disruptions to our customers and our markets in certain of our jurisdictions and could have a material adverse impact to our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity below and Note 22 to the consolidated condensed financial statements for further information Natural Gas is subject to fluctuations in notional natural gas prices which could affect the ability of its suppliers and customers to meet their obligations or otherwise adversely affect CERCs liquidity results of operations and financial condition Natural Gas is subject to risk associated with changes in the notional price of natural gas Increases in natural gas prices might affect Natural Gas ability to collect balances due from customers and could create the potential for uncollectible accounts expense to exceed the recoverable levels built into tariff rates In addition a sustained period of high natural gas prices could i decrease demand for natural gas in the areas in which Natural Gas operates thereby resulting in decreased sales and revenues and ii increase the risk that Natural Gas suppliers or customers fail or are unable to meet their obligations An increase in natural gas prices would also increase working capital requirements by increasing the investment that must be made to maintain natural gas inventory levels For additional risks related to the February 2021 Winter Storm Event see The February 2021 Winter Storm Event has caused severe disruptions to our customers and our markets in certain of our jurisdictions and could have a material adverse impact to our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity below and Note 22 to the consolidated condensed financial statements for further information 27 A decline in CERCs credit rating could result in CERC having to provide collateral under its shipping arrangements or to purchase natural gas which consequently would increase its cash requirements and adversely affect its financial condition If CERCs credit rating were to decline it might be required to post cash collateral under its shipping arrangements or to purchase natural gas If a credit rating downgrade and the resultant cash collateral requirement were to occur at a time when CERC was experiencing significant working capital requirements or otherwise lacked liquidity CERCs results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected For additional risks related to the February 2021 Winter Storm Event see The February 2021 Winter Storm Event has caused severe disruptions to our customers and our markets in certain of our jurisdictions and could have a material adverse impact to our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity below and Note 22 to the consolidated condensed financial statements for further information Natural Gas must compete with alternate energy sources which could result in less natural gas delivered and have an adverse impact on CERCs results of operations financial condition and cash flows Natural Gas competes primarily with alternate energy sources such as electricity and other fuel sources In some areas intrastate pipelines other natural gas distributors and marketers also compete directly with Natural Gas for natural gas sales to end users In addition as a result of federal regulatory changes affecting interstate pipelines natural gas marketers operating on these pipelines may be able to bypass Natural Gas facilities and market sell andor transport natural gas directly to commercial and industrial customers Any reduction in the amount of natural gas delivered by Natural Gas as a result of competition with alternate energy sources may have an adverse impact on CERCs results of operations financial condition and cash flows Risk Factors Affecting ESGs Business CenterPoint Energy ESGs operations could be adversely affected by a number of factors ESGs business results are dependent on a number of factors The industry in which ESG operates is competitive and many of the contracts are subject to a bidding process Should ESG be unsuccessful in bidding contracts for example federal Indefinite DeliveryIndefinite Quantity contracts results of operations could be impacted Through competitive bidding the volume of contracted work could vary significantly from year to year Further to the extent there are unanticipated cost increases in completion of the contracted work or issues arise where amounts due for work performed may not be collected the profit margin realized on any single project could be reduced Changes in legislation and regulations impacting the sectors in which the customers served by ESG operate could adversely impact operating results Additionally ESGs business is subject to other risks including but not limited to the following the discontinuation of the federal ESPC and UESC programs the inability of customers to finance projects failure to appropriately design construct or operate projects and cancellation of projects by customers or reductions in the scope of the projects ESGs business has performance and warranty obligations some of which are guaranteed by CenterPoint Energy In the normal course of business ESG issues performance bonds and other forms of assurance that commit it to operate facilities pay vendors or subcontractors and support warranty obligations As the parent company CenterPoint Energy has and will from time to time guarantee its subsidiaries commitments These guarantees do not represent incremental consolidated obligations rather they represent parental guarantees of subsidiary obligations to allow the subsidiary the flexibility to conduct business without posting other forms of collateral Neither CenterPoint Energy nor Vectren has been called upon to satisfy any obligations pursuant to these parental guarantees Risk Factors Affecting Our Businesses We are subject to operational and financial risks and liabilities arising from environmental laws and regulations including regulation of CCR and climate change legislation as well as other risks related to the implementation of our carbon emissions reduction targets We could also experience reduced demand for our services including certain local initiatives to prohibit new natural gas service and increase electrification initiatives in jurisdictions served by Natural Gas Our operations are subject to stringent and complex laws and regulations pertaining to the environment As an owner or operator of natural gas pipelines distribution systems and storage steam electric generating facilities and electric transmission and distribution systems and the facilities that support these systems we must comply with these laws and regulations at the federal state and local levels These laws and regulations can restrict or impact our business activities in many ways including among others restricting the use of fossil fuels through future climate legislation or regulation limiting airborne emissions from generating facilities restricting the way we manage wastes including wastewater discharges and air emissions and requiring remedial action or monitoring to mitigate environmental actions caused by our operations or attributable to former 28 operations We may need to spend substantial amounts and devote other resources from time to time to comply with these requirements Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative civil and criminal enforcement measures including the assessment of monetary penalties revocation of permits the imposition of remedial actions and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations Certain environmental statutes impose strict joint and several liability for costs required to clean restore and monitor sites where hazardous substances have been stored disposed or released Moreover it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other waste products into the environment In April 2015 the EPA finalized its CCR Rule which regulates ash as nonhazardous material under the RCRA The final rule allows beneficial reuse of ash and the majority of the ash generated by Indiana Electrics generating plants will continue to be beneficially reused In July 2018 the EPA released its final CCR Rule Phase I Reconsideration which extended the deadline to October 31 2020 for ceasing placement of ash in ponds that exceed groundwater protections standards or that fail to meet location restrictions In August 2019 the EPA proposed additional Part A amendments to its CCR Rule with respect to beneficial reuse of ash and other materials Further Part B amendments which related to alternate liners for CCR surface impoundments and the surface impoundment closure process were published in March 2020 The Part A amendments were finalized in August 2020 and the Part B amendments were finalized in November 2020 and extended the deadline to cease placement of ash in ponds to April 11 2021 The EPA published an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking on legacy CCR surface impoundments in October 2020 and in December 2020 provided new data and requested public comment as part of the Agencys reconsideration of its definition of beneficial reuse The Part A amendments do not restrict Indiana Electrics current beneficial reuse of its fly ash CenterPoint Energy continues to evaluate the Part B amendments to determine potential impacts The potential effects of future amendments to the CCR Rule are uncertain at this time Regulatory agencies have also adopted and from time to time consider adopting new legislation andor modifying existing laws and regulations to reduce GHGs There continues to be a wideranging policy and regulatory debate both nationally and internationally regarding the potential impact of GHGs and possible means for their regulation The EPA has expanded its existing GHG emissions reporting requirements which could also lead to further regulation of GHGs by the EPA The recent trend in environmental regulation has been to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may impact the environment which is expected to continue under the Biden administration For example President Biden has recommitted the United States to the Paris Agreement Shortly after taking office in January 2021 President Biden also issued a series of executive orders designed to address climate change as well as an executive order requiring agencies to review environmental actions taken by the Trump administration The Biden administration has also issued a memorandum to departments and agencies to refrain from proposing or issuing rules until a departmental or agency head appointed or designated by the Biden administration has reviewed and approved the rule Reentry into the Paris Agreement and President Bidens executive orders may result in the development of additional regulations or changes to existing regulations Potential future restrictions include among other things the United States enacting additional GHG regulations and mandated financial emissions and other disclosures The terms on which the United States will be reentering the Paris Agreement are unclear at this time As a distributor and transporter of natural gas Natural Gas revenues operating costs and capital requirements could be adversely affected as a result of any regulatory action that would require installation of new control technologies or a modification of its operations or that would have the effect of reducing the consumption of natural gas Thus there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation and actual future expenditures may be greater than the amounts we currently anticipate Additionally Houston Electrics and Indiana Electrics transmission and distribution businesses revenues could be adversely affected to the extent any resulting regulatory action has the effect of reducing consumption of electricity by ultimate consumers within its service territory Likewise incentives to conserve energy or use energy sources other than natural gas could result in a decrease in demand for our services For further discussion see BusinessEnvironmental Matters in Item 1 and  Risk Factors Affecting Natural Gas Business Natural Gas must compete with alternate energy sources which could result in less natural gas delivered and have an adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows Furthermore in March 2020 we established a goal to reduce carbon emissions directly attributable to our operations 70 from 2005 levels by 2035 and we announced a broad corporate initiative to achieve a net reduction of carbon emissions attributed to customer usage 2030 from 2005 levels by 2040 Our ability to achieve these carbon emission reduction goals depends on various external factors including supportive energy policies alternative fuels programs research and development efforts focused on lowcarbon technologies such as carbon capture customer participation in conservation and energyefficiency programs and low natural gas prices We expect to increase our renewable energy resources portfolio as part of our IRP process and to continue optimizing technology advancements to modernize our systems Any negative opinions with respect to these goals or our environmental practices including any inability to achieve or a scaling back of these goals developed by regulators customers investors or legislators could harm our reputation 29 Evolving investor sentiment related to the use of fossil fuels and initiatives to restrict continued production of fossil fuels may have substantial impacts on CenterPoint Energys electric generation and natural gas businesses For example because Indiana Electrics current generating facilities substantially rely on coal for their operations certain financial institutions choose not to participate in CenterPoint Energys financing arrangements Also certain cities in CenterPoint Energys Natural Gas operational footprint have adopted initiatives to prohibit the construction of new natural gas facilities that would provide service and focus on electrification For example Minneapolis has adopted carbon emission reduction goals in an effort to decrease reliance on fossil gas Also Minnesota cities may consider seeking legislative authority for the ability to enact voluntary enhanced energy standards for all development projects Any such initiatives and legislation could adversely affect CenterPoint Energys results of operations The February 2021 Winter Storm Event has caused severe disruptions to our customers and our markets in certain of our jurisdictions and could have a material adverse impact to our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity In February 2021 certain of our jurisdictions experienced an extreme and unprecedented winter weather event that resulted in prolonged freezing temperatures which impacted and may continue to impact our businesses In Texas the February 2021 Winter Storm Event caused many electric generation facilities to shutdown resulting in electricity generation shortages and high electric prices in the wholesale generation market The electricity generation shortages necessitated ERCOT to direct TDUs including Houston Electric to implement controlled outages in their respective service areas In compliance with ERCOTs directives and emergency procedures Houston Electric implemented controlled electricity outages across its service territory resulting in a substantial number of its customers on certain days over a million residents being without power many for extended periods of time ERCOT has stated that the electric outages were necessary to avoid prolonged largescale statewide blackouts and longterm damage to the electric system in Texas As a result Houston Electrics sales of transmission and distribution services were diminished or interrupted for several days Additionally the electricity generation shortage resulted in wholesale electricity prices increasing to their maximum allowed limit Many REPs may face financial difficulties due to their inability to recover these high prices from their customers and any such financial difficulties may impair the ability of these REPs to pay for Houston Electrics services or could cause them to delay such payments For further information on the concentration of Houston Electrics receivables with REPs see  Houston Electrics receivables are primarily concentrated in a small number of REPs and any delay or default in such payments could adversely affect Houston Electrics cash flows financial condition and results of operations During and in the immediate aftermath of the February 2021 Winter Storm Event there has been focus on the lack of sufficient winterization protection for power generation facilities On February 18 2021 the Governor of Texas requested that the Texas Legislature mandate the winterization of the Texas power system which could include TDUs If any such protections are required in the future the cost of such protections may increase the cost of electricity and reduce consumption of electricity by ultimate consumers in Houston Electrics service territory which could adversely affect Houston Electrics results of operations Any potential decreases in customer usage due to higher electricity prices charged by REPs may not result in increased base rates charged by Houston Electric for its services until its next general base rate proceeding For further information on Houston Electrics regulatory proceedings see  Rate regulation of Houston Electrics and Indiana Electrics businesses may delay or deny their ability to earn an expected return and fully recover their costs Furthermore the February 2021 Winter Storm Event also impacted the wholesale prices CenterPoint Energy and CERC paid for natural gas and their ability to service customers in their Natural Gas service territories including due to the reduction in available natural gas capacity and impacts to CenterPoint Energys and CERCs natural gas supply portfolio activities and the effects of weather on their systems and their ability to transport natural gas among other things CenterPoint Energy and CERC experienced significant impacts as the February 2021 Winter Storm Event impacted the overall natural gas market including resulting in increases in the costs of natural gas supply In particular the February 2021 Winter Storm Event also caused severe disruptions in the markets from which CenterPoint Energy and CERC sourced a significant portion of their natural gas for their utility operations resulting in extraordinary increases in the price of natural gas to CenterPoint Energy and CERC From February 12 2021 to February 22 2021 management estimates CenterPoint Energy spent approximately an incremental 25 billion more on natural gas supplies compared to plan inclusive of an incremental 23 billion more spent by CERC on natural gas supplies compared to plan These amounts are preliminary estimates through February 23 2021 and are subject to final settlement These purchases are generally payable at the end of March 2021 As of February 22 2021 CenterPoint Energy had approximately 21 billion in total liquidity While CenterPoint Energy and CERC will seek to recover these increased gas purchase costs from customers although neither full recovery nor the timing of that recovery is certain in the interim CenterPoint Energy and CERC will seek additional external financing to pay for such natural gas working capital which may consist of short and longterm debt but such external financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all On February 24 2021 CERC received financing commitments totaling 17 billion for a 364day term loan facility to bridge potential working capital needs Any additional external debt financing andor partial or delayed recovery of these natural gas 30 costs may negatively impact CenterPoint Energys or CERCs credit metrics and could lead to a downgrade of CenterPoint Energys or CERCs credit rating The inability of CenterPoint Energy or CERC to recover all or a portion of the increased costs of natural gas or any associated delay in recovery in addition to the increased external financing required to pay for such natural gas could have a material adverse impact on CenterPoint Energys or CERCs financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity In addition to the risks discussed in this risk factor for further information on risks related to  the arranging of future financings on acceptable terms see  If we are unable to arrange future financings on acceptable terms our ability to finance our capital expenditures or refinance outstanding indebtedness could be limited  the ability to seek recovery of the additional costs natural gas see  Rate regulation of Natural Gas may delay or deny its ability to earn an expected return and fully recover its costs  access to natural gas supplies see  Access to natural gas supplies and pipeline transmission and storage capacity are essential components of reliable service for Natural Gass customers  various regulatory investigations litigation or other proceedings see  In connection with the February 2021 Winter Storm Event there have been calls for reform of the Texas electric market which if implemented could have material adverse impacts on Houston Electric  the fluctuations in notional natural gas prices see  Natural Gas is subject to fluctuations in notional natural gas prices which could affect the ability of its suppliers and customers to meet their obligations or otherwise adversely affect CERCs liquidity results of operations and financial condition  the impact of a decline in CERCs credit rating see  A decline in CERCs credit rating could result in CERC having to provide collateral under its shipping arrangements or to purchase natural gas which consequently would increase its cash requirements and adversely affect its financial condition and  potential reforms of the Texas electric market see  In connection with the February 2021 Winter Storm Event there have been calls for reform of the Texas electric market which if implemented could have material adverse impacts on Houston Electrics business CenterPoint Energy may be unable to effectively complete the integration of the businesses acquired in the Merger including the integration of technology systems for which significant time and resources have been allocated thereto CenterPoint Energy continues to integrate certain aspects of CenterPoint Energys and Vectrens businesses The integration of technology systems and processes that CenterPoint Energy uses to plan and report financial information manage work monitor systems respond to outages and perform other critical functions has been and continues to be a complex costly and time consuming process which is expected to be completed in 2021 CenterPoint Energy may experience delays costoverruns or other issues affecting the successful completion of the integration of these technology systems and other related processes The failure to timely efficiently and costeffectively complete the integration could adversely affect CenterPoint Energys results of operations and cash flows In connection with the integration of such technology systems and processes CenterPoint Energy must also successfully design and operate its systems of internal controls to continue to accurately provide reliable financial reports including reporting of its financial condition results of operations or cash flows effectively prevent fraud and operate successfully as a public company If CenterPoint Energys efforts to maintain an effective system of internal controls throughout the integration of its technology systems are not successful it is unable to maintain adequate controls over its financial reporting and processes in the future or it is unable to comply with its obligations under Section 404 of the SarbanesOxley Act of 2002 CenterPoint Energy could be harmed or it may fail to meet its reporting obligations Ineffective internal controls also could cause investors to lose confidence in CenterPoint Energys reported financial information which would likely have a negative effect on among other things the trading prices of its securities Our results of operations financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully operate our facilities or perform certain corporate functions Our performance depends on the successful operation of our facilities Operating these facilities involves many risks inherent in the generation transmission and distribution of electricity and in the delivery of natural gas that could result in substantial losses or other damages These risks include but are not limited to the following  operator error or failure of equipment or processes including failure to follow appropriate safety protocols  the handling of hazardous equipment or materials that could result in serious personal injury loss of life and environmental and property damage 31  operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements  labor disputes  information technology or financial and billing system failures including those due to the implementation and integration of new technology that impair our information technology infrastructure reporting systems or disrupt normal business operations  information technology failure that affects our ability to access customer information or causes us to lose confidential or proprietary data that materially and adversely affects our reputation or exposes us to legal claims and  catastrophic events such as fires earthquakes explosions leaks floods droughts hurricanes ice storms flooding terrorism wildfires pandemic health events or other similar occurrences including any environmental impacts related thereto which catastrophic events may require participation in mutual assistance efforts by us or other utilities to assist in power restoration efforts Such events may result in a decrease or elimination of revenue from our facilities an increase in the cost of operating our facilities or delays in cash collections any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition andor cash flows Our revenues and results of operations are seasonal A significant portion of Houston Electrics revenues is derived from rates that it collects from each REP based on the amount of electricity it delivers on behalf of such REP Similarly Indiana Electrics revenues are derived from rates it charges its customers to provide electricity Natural Gas revenues are primarily derived from natural gas sales Consequently Houston Electrics Indiana Electrics and Natural Gas revenues and results of operations are subject to seasonality weather conditions and other changes in electricity and natural gas usage as applicable Houston Electrics revenues are generally higher during the warmer months As in certain past years unusually mild weather in the warmer months could diminish Houston Electrics results of operations and harm its financial condition Conversely as in certain past years extreme warm weather conditions could increase Houston Electrics results of operations in a manner that would not likely be annually recurring A significant portion of Indiana Electrics sales are for space heating and cooling Consequently as in certain past years Indiana Electrics results of operations may be adversely affected by warmerthannormal heating season weather or colderthannormal cooling season weather while more extreme seasonal weather conditions could increase Indiana Electrics results of operations in a manner that would not likely be annually recurring Natural Gas revenues are customarily higher during the winter months As in certain past years unusually mild weather in the winter months could diminish Natural Gas results of operations and harm its financial condition Conversely as occurred in certain past years extreme cold weather conditions could increase its results of operations in a manner that would not likely be annually recurring For information related to our weather hedges see Note 9a to the consolidated financial statements For additional risks related to the February 2021 Winter Storm Event see The February 2021 Winter Storm Event has caused severe disruptions to our customers and our markets in certain of our jurisdictions and could have a material adverse impact to our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity below and Note 22 to the consolidated condensed financial statements for further information Climate changes could adversely impact financial results from our businesses and result in more frequent and more severe weather events that could adversely affect our results of operations A changing climate creates uncertainty and could result in broad changes both physical and financial in nature to our service territories If climate changes occur that result in warmer temperatures in our service territories financial results from our businesses could be adversely impacted For example Natural Gas could be adversely affected through lower natural gas usage Another possible result of climate change is more frequent and more severe weather events such as hurricanes tornadoes or severe winter weather conditions including ice storms Since certain of our facilities are located along or near the Gulf Coast increased or more severe hurricanes or tornadoes could increase our costs to repair damaged facilities and restore service to our customers For example in 2020 eight named storms occurred along the Gulf Coast Of these eight storms we experienced four named hurricanes in our service territories which impacted our Natural Gas facilities Our electric and Natural Gas operations in our services territories were impacted due to the February 2021 Winter Storm Event For further information on the February 2021 Winter Storm Event see Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements and The February 2021 Winter Storm Event has caused severe disruptions to our customers and our markets in certain of our jurisdictions and could have a material adverse impact to our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity above When we cannot deliver electricity or natural gas to customers or our customers cannot receive our services our financial results can be impacted by lost revenues and we generally must seek approval from regulators to recover restoration costs To the extent we are unable to recover those costs or if higher rates resulting from our recovery of such costs result in reduced demand for our services our future financial results may be adversely impacted Any such decreased energy use may also require us to retire current infrastructure that is no longer needed Further we may be subject to climate change lawsuits which could result in substantial penalties or damages 32 Aging infrastructure may lead to increased costs and disruptions in operations that could negatively impact our financial results We have risks associated with aging infrastructure assets including the failure of equipment or processes and potential breakdowns due to such aging The age of certain of our assets may result in a need for replacement or higher level of maintenance costs because of our risk based federal and state compliant integrity management programs Failure to achieve timely and full recovery of these expenses could adversely impact revenues and could result in increased capital expenditures or expenses In addition the nature of information available on aging infrastructure assets may make inspections maintenance upgrading and replacement of the assets particularly challenging Further with respect to Natural Gas operations if certain pipeline replacements for example castiron or bare steel pipe are not completed timely or successfully government agencies and private parties might allege the uncompleted replacements caused events such as fires explosions or leaks Although we maintain insurance for certain of our facilities our insurance coverage may not be sufficient in the event that a catastrophic loss is alleged to have been caused by a failure to timely complete equipment replacements Insufficient insurance coverage and increased insurance costs could adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flows Our businesses will continue to have to adapt to technological change and may not be successful or may have to incur significant expenditures to adapt to technological change We operate businesses that require sophisticated data collection processing systems software and other technology Some of the technologies supporting the industries we serve are changing rapidly and increasing in complexity New technologies will emerge or grow that may be superior to or may not be compatible with some of our existing technologies and may require us to make significant investments and expenditures so that we can continue to provide costeffective and reliable methods for energy production and delivery Among such technological advances are distributed generation resources eg private solar microturbines fuel cells energy storage devices and more energyefficient buildings and products designed to reduce energy consumption and waste As these technologies become a more costcompetitive option over time whether through cost effectiveness or government incentives and subsidies certain customers may choose to meet their own energy needs and subsequently decrease usage of our systems and services including Indiana Electrics generating facilities becoming less competitive and economical Further certain regulatory and legislative bodies have introduced or are considering requirements andor incentives to reduce energy consumption by certain dates Additionally technological advances driven by federal laws mandating new levels of energy efficiency in enduse electric and natural gas devices or other improvements in or applications of technology could lead to declines in per capita energy consumption Our future success will depend in part on our ability to anticipate and adapt to these technological changes in a costeffective manner to offer on a timely basis reliable services that meet customer demands and evolving industry standards and to recover all or a significant portion of any unrecovered investment in obsolete assets If we fail to adapt successfully to any technological change or obsolescence fail to obtain access to important technologies or incur significant expenditures in adapting to technological change or if implemented technology does not operate as anticipated our businesses operating results financial condition and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected Our potential business strategies and strategic initiatives including merger and acquisition activities and the disposition of assets or businesses may not be completed or perform as expected adversely affecting our financial condition results of operations and cash flows Our financial condition results of operations and cash flows depend in part on our managements ability to implement our business strategies successfully and realize the anticipated benefits therefrom In May 2020 our Board of Directors established a Business Review and Evaluation Committee which was designed to assist the Board of Directors in evaluating and optimizing our businesses assets and ownership interests In October 2020 the Business Review and Evaluation Committee of the Board of Directors completed its review and made final recommendations to the full Board of Directors Our business strategy incorporated the Business Review and Evaluation Committees recommendations to further increase our planned capital expenditures in our electric and Natural Gas businesses to support rate base growth and sell certain of our Natural Gas businesses located in Arkansas and Oklahoma as a means to efficiently finance a portion of such increased capital expenditures among other recommendations From time to time we have made and may continue to make acquisitions or divestitures of businesses and assets including our proposed sale of our Natural Gas businesses in Arkansas and Oklahoma and the Enable Merger form joint ventures or undertake restructurings However suitable acquisition candidates or potential buyers may not continue to be available on terms and conditions we find acceptable or the expected benefits of completed acquisitions may not be realized fully or at all or may not be realized in the anticipated timeframe In particular if proceeds from our proposed sale are less than what we anticipate or if those sales or the Enable Merger are not completed for any reason we may be required to seek alternative methods to finance our proposed capital expenditure program or cut back on such capital expenditure program 33 For additional risks related to the Enable Merger see the risks listed under the Risk Factors Affecting CenterPoint Energys Interests in Enable Midstream Partners LP and Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the Enable Merger If we are unable to make acquisitions or if those acquisitions do not perform as anticipated our future growth may be adversely affected Further any completed or future acquisitions involve substantial risks including the following  acquired businesses or assets may not produce revenues earnings or cash flow at anticipated levels  acquired businesses or assets could have environmental permitting or other problems for which contractual protections prove inadequate  we may assume liabilities that were not disclosed to us that exceed our estimates or for which our rights to indemnification from the seller are limited  we may be unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully and realize anticipated economic operational and other benefits in a timely manner which could result in substantial costs and delays or other operational technical or financial problems and  acquisitions or the pursuit of acquisitions could disrupt our ongoing businesses distract management divert resources and make it difficult to maintain current business standards controls and procedures We are exposed to risks related to reduction in energy consumption due to factors such as unfavorable economic conditions in our service territories and changes in customers perceptions from incidents of other utilities involving natural gas pipelines Our businesses are affected by reduction in energy consumption due to factors including economic climate and market conditions in our service territories energy efficiency initiatives use of alternative technologies and changes in our customers perceptions regarding natural gas usage as a result of incidents of other utilities involving natural gas pipelines which could impact our ability to grow our customer base and our rate of growth Growth in customer accounts and growth of customer usage each directly influence demand for electricity and natural gas and the need for additional delivery facilities Customer growth and customer usage are affected by a number of factors outside our control such as mandated energy efficiency measures demandside management goals distributed generation resources and economic and demographic conditions including population changes job and income growth housing starts new business formation and the overall level of economic activity Declines in demand for electricity and natural gas in our service territories due to pipeline incidents of other utilities increased electricity and natural gas prices as experienced during the February 2021 Winter Storm Event and economic downturns among other factors could reduce overall usage and lessen cash flows especially as industrial customers reduce production and therefore consumption of electricity and natural gas Although Houston Electrics and Indiana Electrics transmission and distribution businesses are subject to regulated allowable rates of return and recovery of certain costs under periodic adjustment clauses overall declines in electricity delivered and used as a result of economic downturn or recession could reduce revenues and cash flows thereby diminishing results of operations Additionally the significant decline in energy and commodity prices that occurred during 2020 if sustained into 2021 could cause the rate of economic employment andor population growth in certain of our service territories to decline In particular Houston Texas has a higher percentage of employment tied to the energy sector relative to other regions of the country A reduction in the rate of economic employment andor population growth could result in lower growth and reduced demand for and usage of electricity and natural gas in such service territories As such sustained low energy and commodity prices could have an adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity Some or all of these factors could result in a lack of growth or decline in customer demand for electricity or number of customers and may result in our failure to fully realize anticipated benefits from significant capital investments and expenditures which could have a material adverse effect on their financial position results of operations and cash flows Risk Factors Affecting CenterPoint Energys Interests in Enable Midstream Partners LP CenterPoint Energy CenterPoint Energys cash flows will be adversely impacted if it receives less cash distributions from Enable than it currently expects whether as a result of Enables performance or otherwise or if it reduces its ownership in Enable CenterPoint Energy holds a substantial limited partner interest in Enable 537 of the outstanding common units representing limited partner interests in Enable as of December 31 2020 as well as 50 of the management rights in Enable GP and a 40 interest in the incentive distribution rights held by Enable GP As of December 31 2020 CenterPoint Energy owned an aggregate of 14520000 Enable Series A Preferred Units representing limited partner interests in Enable Accordingly CenterPoint Energys future earnings results of operations cash flows and financial condition will be affected by the performance of Enable the amount of cash distributions it receives from Enable and the value of its interests in Enable Enable has historically been expected to pay a minimum quarterly distribution of 02875 per unit or 115 per unit on an annualized basis on its outstanding common units to the extent it has sufficient cash from operations after establishment of cash 34 reserves and payment of fees and expenses including payments to Enable GP and its affiliates referred to as available cash Enable may not have sufficient available cash each quarter to enable it i to pay distributions on the Enable Series A Preferred Units or ii maintain or increase the distributions on its common units On April 1 2020 in response to COVID19 and economic conditions impacting the oil and gas industry Enable announced a reduction in its quarterly distributions per common unit from 03305 distributed for the fourth quarter 2019 to 016525 representing a 50 reduction This reduction has resulted in and is expected to result in additional quarterly distributions to CenterPoint Energy that fall below the expected minimum quarterly distribution of 02875 per common unit This reduction in Enables quarterly distributions per common unit reduces its common unit distributions to CenterPoint Energy by approximately 155 million per year assuming no further reductions To the extent such economic conditions persist or further deteriorate quarterly distributions on Enables common units may be subject to further reductions For further discussion regarding CenterPoint Energys impairment of its equity investment in Enable please see An impairment of goodwill longlived assets including intangible assets equity

0625 per Enable Series A Preferred Unit or 250 per Enable Series A Preferred Unit on an annualized basis until February 17 2021 Thereafter Enable is expected to pay a distribution on the Enable Series A Preferred Units with an annual rate equal to threemonth LIBOR plus 85 Distributions on each Enable Series A Preferred Unit are not mandatory and are noncumulative in the event distributions are not declared on the Enable Series A Preferred Units Additionally distributions on the Enable Series A Preferred Units reduce the amount of available cash Enable has to pay distributions on its common units The amount of cash Enable can distribute on its common units and the Enable Series A Preferred Units will principally depend upon the amount of cash it generates from its operations which will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on among other things the fees and gross margins it realizes with respect to the volume of natural gas NGLs and crude oil that it handles and the prices of levels of production of and demand for natural gas NGLs and crude oil Please refer to Enables operational regulatory and financial risks and other factors set forth in its SEC filings that may have a material impact on its performance and cash distributions and hence the value of CenterPoint Energys interests in Enable Additionally CenterPoint Energys process of evaluating and optimizing the various businesses assets and ownership interests currently held by it considered among other things various plans proposals and other strategic alternatives with respect to Enable and CenterPoint Energys investment in Enable In February 2021 CenterPoint Energy announced its support of the Enable Merger which is expected to close in the second half of 2021 subject to customary closing conditions including HartScottRodino antitrust clearance See Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements for further information CenterPoint Energy may not realize any or all of the anticipated strategic financial operational or other benefits from the Enable Merger if completed or from any disposition or reduction of its resulting investment in Energy Transfer There can be no assurances that any disposal of Energy Transfer common units or Energy Transfer Series G Preferred Units will be completed Any disposal of such securities may involve significant costs and expenses including in connection with any public offering a significant underwriting discount There can be no assurances that CenterPoint Energy will be able to reinvest any proceeds from the disposition of any Energy Transfer common units or Energy Transfer Series G Preferred Units if any when received as a result of the closing of the Enable Merger in a manner that provides for a similar rate of return as those securities We cannot be certain of the precise value of any merger consideration we may receive in the Enable Merger because the exchange ratio is fixed and the market price of Energy Transfers common units may fluctuate At the time the Enable Merger is completed each issued and outstanding Enable common unit we own will be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration of 08595 of one common unit representing limited partner interests in Energy Transfer The exchange ratio for the merger consideration is fixed and there will be no adjustment to the merger consideration for changes in the market price of Energy Transfers common units or Enables common units prior to the completion of the Enable Merger If the Enable Merger is completed there will be a time lapse between the Enable Merger Agreement date and the date on which we are entitled to and actually receive the merger consideration The market value of Energy Transfers common units may fluctuate during this period as a result of a variety of factors including general market and economic conditions changes in Energy Transfers businesses operations and prospects and regulatory considerations Such factors are difficult to predict and in many cases may be beyond Enables and Energy Transfers control The actual value of any merger consideration we receive upon the completion of the Enable Merger will depend on the market value of the Energy Transfer common units at that time This market value may differ possibly materially from the market value of Energy Transfers common units at the time the merger agreement was entered into or at any other time 35 The Enable Merger may not be completed and the Enable Merger Agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms The Enable Merger is subject to a number of conditions that must be satisfied or waived prior to its completion including i the receipt of the required approvals from Enables unitholders ii the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the HartScottRodino Act iii the absence of any governmental order or law that prohibits or makes illegal the consummation of the Enable Merger iv Energy Transfer common units issuable in connection with the Enable Merger having been authorized for listing on the New York Stock Exchange subject to official notice of issuance and v Energy Transfers registration statement on Form S4 having been declared effective by the SEC under the Securities Act The obligation of each party to consummate the Enable Merger is also conditioned upon the other partys representations and warranties being true and correct subject to certain materiality exceptions and the other party having performed in all material respects its obligations under the Enable Merger Agreement Enables obligation to consummate the Enable Merger is further conditioned upon the receipt of a customary tax opinion of counsel that for US federal income tax purposes subject to certain exceptions i it should not recognize any income or gain as a result of the Enable Merger and ii no gain or loss should be recognized by holders of Enables common units or Series A Preferred Units as a result of the Enable Merger These conditions to the completion of the Enable Merger may not be satisfied or waived in a timely manner or at all and accordingly the Enable Merger may be delayed or may not be completed Moreover if the Enable Merger is not completed by November 30 2021 either Energy Transfer or Enable may choose not to proceed with the Enable Merger and the parties can mutually decide to terminate the Enable Merger agreement at any time before or after approval by Enables common unitholders In addition Energy Transfer and Enable may elect to terminate the Enable Merger Agreement in certain other circumstances as further detailed in the Enable Merger Agreement If the Enable Merger Agreement is terminated under specified circumstances Enable may be required to pay Energy Transfer a termination fee Furthermore if the Enable Merger is not completed for any reason Enables future businesses and financial results may be adversely affected including among other things Enable may experience negative reactions from the financial markets including negative impacts on the market price of its common units Enable will be subject to business uncertainties while the Enable Merger is pending which could adversely affect its businesses Uncertainties about the effect of the Enable Merger on employees and customers may have an adverse effect on Enable These uncertainties may impair its ability to attract retain and motivate key personnel until the merger is completed and for a period of time thereafter and could cause customers and others that deal with Enable to seek to change their existing business relationships Employee retention may be particularly challenging during the pendency of the Enable Merger as employees may experience uncertainty about their roles with Energy Transfer following the Enable Merger In addition the Enable Merger Agreement restricts Enable from entering into certain corporate transactions and taking other specified actions without the consent of Energy Transfer and generally requires Enables to continue its operations in the ordinary course until completion of the Enable Merger These restrictions may prevent Enable from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the Enable Merger The common units representing limited partner interests in Energy Transfer to be received by us upon completion of the Enable Merger will have different rights than Enables common units Upon completion of the Enable Merger we will no longer be unitholders of Enable Instead we will become Energy Transfer unitholders and while our rights as Energy Transfer unitholders will continue to be governed by the laws of the state of Delaware such rights will be subject to and governed by the terms of the Energy Transfer Certificate of Limited Partnership as amended and the Third Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of Energy Transfer as amended The laws of the state of Delaware and terms of the Energy Transfer certificate of limited partnership and the Energy Transfer Third Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership are in some respects different than the terms of Enables Certificate of Limited Partnership and its Partnership Agreement which currently govern our rights General Risk Factors Affecting Our Businesses andor CenterPoint Energys Interests in Enable Midstream Partners LP Cyberattacks physical security breaches acts of terrorism or other disruptions could adversely impact our reputation results of operations financial condition andor cash flows We are subject to cyber and physical security risks related to adversaries attacking information technology systems network infrastructure technology and facilities used to conduct almost all of our businesses which includes among other things i managing operations and other business processes and ii protecting sensitive information maintained in the normal 36 course of business For example the operation of our electric generation transmission and distribution systems are dependent on not only physical interconnection of our facilities but also on communications among the various components of our systems and thirdparty systems This reliance on information and communication between and among those components has increased since deployment of the intelligent grid smart devices and operational technologies across our businesses Further certain of the various internal systems we use to conduct our businesses are highly integrated Consequently a cyberattack or unauthorized access in any one of these systems could potentially impact the other systems Similarly our business operations are interconnected with external networks and facilities The distribution of natural gas to our customers requires communications with Enables pipeline facilities and thirdparty systems The gathering processing and transportation of natural gas from Enables gathering processing and pipeline facilities and crude oil gathering pipeline systems also rely on communications among its facilities and with thirdparty systems that may be delivering natural gas or crude oil into or receiving natural gas or crude oil and other products from Enables facilities Disruption of those communications whether caused by physical disruption such as storms or other natural disasters by failure of equipment or technology or by manmade events such as cyberattacks or acts of terrorism may disrupt our or Enables ability to conduct operations and control assets Cyberattacks including phishing attacks and threats from the use of malicious code such as malware ransomware and viruses and unauthorized access could also result in the loss or unauthorized use of confidential proprietary or critical infrastructure data or security breaches of other information technology systems that could disrupt operations and critical business functions adversely affect reputation increase costs and subject us to possible legal claims and liability Further third parties including vendors suppliers and contractors who perform certain services for us or administer and maintain our sensitive information could also be targets of cyberattacks and unauthorized access We are not fully insured against all cybersecurity risks any of which could adversely affect our reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition andor cash flows As domestic and global cyber threats are ongoing and increasing in sophistication magnitude and frequency our critical energy infrastructure may be targets of statesponsored attacks terrorist activities or otherwise that could disrupt our respective business operations Furthermore experts have observed an increase in the volume and the sophistication of cyberattacks since the beginning of the COVID19 pandemic which could lead to additional disruptions For information about our cybersecurity risks related to COVID19 please see We face risks related to COVID19 and other health epidemics and outbreaks including economic regulatory legal workforce and cyber security risks which could adversely impact our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity below Any such disruptions could result in significant costs to repair damaged facilities restore service and implement increased security measures which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition andor cash flows Failure to maintain the security of personally identifiable information could adversely affect us In connection with our businesses we and our vendors suppliers and contractors collect and retain personally identifiable information for example information of our customers shareholders suppliers and employees and there is an expectation that we and such third parties will adequately protect that information The regulatory environment surrounding information security and data privacy is increasingly demanding New laws and regulations governing data privacy and the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information pose increasingly complex compliance challenges and elevate our costs Any failure by us to comply with these laws and regulations including as a result of a security or privacy breach could result in significant costs fines and penalties and liabilities for us A significant theft loss or fraudulent use of the personally identifiable information we maintain or failure of our vendors suppliers and contractors to use or maintain such data in accordance with contractual provisions and other legal requirements could adversely impact our reputation and could result in significant costs fines and penalties and liabilities for us Additionally if we acquire a company that has violated or is not in compliance with applicable data protection laws we may incur significant liabilities and penalties as a result Our insurance coverage may not be sufficient Insufficient insurance coverage and increased insurance costs could adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flows We currently have insurance in place such as general liability and property insurance to cover certain of our facilities in amounts that we consider appropriate Such policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles and do not include business interruption coverage Insurance coverage may not be available in the future at current costs or on commercially reasonable terms and the insurance proceeds received for any loss of or any damage to any of our facilities may not be sufficient to fully cover or restore the loss or damage without negative impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows Costs damages and other liabilities related to recent events and incidents that affected other utilities such as wildfires and explosions among other things have exceeded or could exceed such utilities insurance coverage Further as a result of these recent events and incidents the marketplace for insurance coverage may be unavailable or limited in capacity or any such available coverage may be deemed by us to be cost prohibitive under current conditions Any such coverage if available may not be eligible for recovery whether in full or in part by us through the rates charged by our utility businesses 37 In common with other companies in its line of business that serve coastal regions Houston Electric does not have insurance covering its transmission and distribution system other than substations because Houston Electric believes it to be cost prohibitive and insurance capacity to be limited Historically Houston Electric has been able to recover the costs incurred in restoring its transmission and distribution properties following hurricanes or other disasters through issuance of storm restoration bonds or a change in its regulated rates or otherwise In the future any such recovery may not be granted Therefore Houston Electric may not be able to restore any loss of or damage to any of its transmission and distribution properties without negative impact on its results of operations financial condition and cash flows We face risks related to COVID19 and other health epidemics and outbreaks including economic regulatory legal workforce and cyber security risks which could adversely impact our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity The COVID19 pandemic is a rapidly evolving situation that is adversely affecting current global economic activities and conditions An extended slowdown of economic growth decreased demand for commodities andor material changes in governmental or regulatory policy in the United States has resulted in and could continue to result in lower growth including customer growth and reduced demand for and usage of electricity and natural gas in our service territories as customer facilities close remain closed or potentially close again We have experienced reduced demand and usage among our electric and natural gas commercial and industrial customers as well as a decrease in revenues from disconnections and reconnections due to the disconnect moratoriums across our service territories due to COVID19 which have either expired or may expire during the second quarter of 2021 in certain of the Registrants service territories The ability of our customers contractors and suppliers to meet their obligations to us including payment obligations has also been negatively affected under the current economic conditions As a result of the disconnect moratoriums across our Natural Gas service territories and other payment deferrals or arrangements days outstanding on receivables and uncollectible accounts have increased resulting in an increase to allowance for credit losses To the extent these conditions in our service territories persist our bad debt expense from uncollectible accounts could continue to increase negatively impacting our financial condition results of operations and cash flows REPs could encounter financial difficulties including bankruptcies which could impair their ability to pay for Houston Electrics services or could cause them to delay such payments adversely affecting Houston Electrics cash flows and liquidity Additionally our state and local regulatory agencies in response to a federal mandate or otherwise could impose restrictions on the rates we charge to provide our services including the inability to implement approved rates or delay actions with respect to our rate cases and filings The COVID19 pandemic may affect our ability to timely satisfy regulatory requirements such as recordkeeping andor timely reporting requirements For further information on COVID19 regulatory matters please see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements which information is incorporated herein by reference With respect to our supply chain while we have not experienced significant disruptions or challenges from the COVID19 pandemic to the extent we experience such disruptions in our supply chain that limit our ability to obtain materials and equipment necessary for our businesses whether through delayed order fulfillment limited production or unavailability due to COVID19 we may be unable to perform our operations timely or as anticipated which could result in service or construction delays or increased costs Furthermore in the event key officers or a substantial portion of our workforce were to be impacted by COVID19 for an extended period of time we may face challenges with respect to our services or operations and we may not be able to execute our capital plan as anticipated There is considerable uncertainty regarding the extent to which COVID19 will continue to spread even with the availability of a vaccine therefor and the extent and duration of governmental and other measures implemented to try to slow the spread of COVID19 such as largescale travel bans and restrictions border closures quarantines shelterinplace orders and business and government shutdowns Restrictions of this nature have caused and may continue to cause us our suppliers and other business counterparties to experience operational delays shortages of employees facility shutdowns or business closures We have modified certain business and workforce practices including those related to employee travel employee work locations and participation in meetings events and conferences to conform to government restrictions and best practices encouraged by governmental and regulatory authorities However the quarantine of personnel or the inability to access our facilities or customer sites could adversely affect our operations While certain of our personnel have been and may continue to be quarantined our operations and corporate functions have not been adversely affected to date As of the date of this Form 10K we have increased the permitted occupancy of certain of our offices and facilities with the rest of our officebased personnel continuing to work remotely under alternate work arrangements Where we must maintain a presence in the field we have adjusted our operational protocols to minimize exposure and risk to our field personnel customers and the communities we serve including among other things modifying our work schedules and reporting locations delaying certain work types such as maintenance and capital projects and adjusting project scope and scale to adhere to safety protocols while continuing to maintain the work activities necessary for safe and reliable service to our customers with increased safety precautions but we cannot assure that such adjustments and precautions will be sufficient to minimize exposure to and risk from COVID19 Also we have a limited number of highly skilled employees for some of our operations If a large proportion of our employees in those critical positions were to contract COVID19 at the same time we would rely upon our business continuity plans in an effort to continue operations at our facilities but there is no certainty that 38 such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the adverse impact to our operations that could result from shortages of highly skilled employees Additionally in the event that customers contractors employees or others were to allege that they contracted COVID19 because of actions we took or failed to take we could face claims lawsuits and potential legal liability In addition to the reasonableness of our actions and efforts to comply with applicable COVID19 guidance our exposure and ultimate liability would depend upon the applicability of workers compensation the availability of insurance coverage and limitations on liability being considered or enacted at the state and federal level Experts have observed an increase in the volume and the sophistication of cyberattacks since the beginning of the COVID19 pandemic Any technology system breaches andor data privacy incidents could disrupt our operations or result in the loss or exposure of confidential or sensitive customer employee or company information and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations As many of our employees and thirdparty service providers work remotely in accordance with government mandates or guidelines we face heightened cyber security and privacy risks related to unauthorized system access aggressive social engineering tactics and adversaries attacking the information technology systems network infrastructure technology and facilities used to conduct our business The increase in the remote working arrangements of our employees as a result of the COVID19 pandemic has required enhancements and modifications to our information technology infrastructure for example virtual private network or VPN and remote collaboration systems and any failures of these technologies including thirdparty service providers that facilitate working remotely could limit our ability to conduct our ordinary operations and expose us to increased risk or impact of a cyberattack We will continue to monitor developments affecting our employees customers and operations At this time however we cannot predict the extent or duration of the COVID19 pandemic or its effects on national state and local economies including the impact on our ability to access capital markets our supply chain our business strategies and plans and our workforce nor can we estimate the potential adverse impact from COVID19 on our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity Our success depends upon our ability to attract effectively transition motivate and retain key employees and identify and develop talent to succeed senior management We depend on senior executive officers and other key personnel Our success depends on our ability to attract effectively transition and retain key personnel The inability to recruit and retain or effectively transition key personnel or the unexpected loss of key personnel may adversely affect our operations In addition because of the reliance on our management team our future success depends in part on our ability to identify and develop talent to succeed senior management The retention of key personnel and appropriate senior management succession planning will continue to be critically important to the successful implementation of our strategies Failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce and maintain good labor relations could adversely impact the operations of our facilities and our results of operations Our businesses are dependent on recruiting retaining and motivating employees Certain circumstances such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements a mismatch of existing skillsets to future needs or the unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges such as a lack of resources loss of knowledge or a lengthy time period associated with skill development Our costs including costs to replace employees productivity costs and safety costs may rise Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate our businesses particularly the specialized skills and knowledge required to construct and operate generation facilities a technologyenabled power grid and transmission and distribution facilities among other facilities If we are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce our results of operations could be negatively affected Furthermore the operations of our facilities depends on good labor relations with our employees and several of our businesses have entered into and have in place collective bargaining agreements with different labor unions comprising approximately 36 of our workforce We have several separate bargaining units each with a unique collective bargaining agreement described further in Note 8j to the consolidated financial statements which information is incorporated herein by reference The collective bargaining agreements with OPEIU Local 12 and Mankato related to Natural Gas employees in Minnesota are scheduled to expire in May 2021 and March 2021 respectively and negotiations are currently in progress and expected to be completed before the May 2021 and March 2021 expirations Any failure to reach an agreement on new labor contracts or to negotiate these labor contracts might result in strikes boycotts or other labor disruptions These potential labor disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our businesses results of operations andor cash flows Labor disruptions strikes or significant negotiated wage and benefit increases whether due to union activities employee turnover or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our businesses results of operations andor cash flows 39 Changing demographics poor investment performance of pension plan assets and other factors adversely affecting the calculation of pension liabilities could unfavorably impact our results of operations liquidity and financial position CenterPoint Energy and its subsidiaries maintain qualified defined benefit pension plans covering certain of its employees Costs associated with these plans are dependent upon a number of factors including the investment returns on plan assets the level of interest rates used to calculate the funded status of the plan contributions to the plan the number of plan participants and government regulations with respect to funding requirements and the calculation of plan liabilities Funding requirements may increase and CenterPoint Energy may be required to make unplanned contributions in the event of a decline in the market value of plan assets a decline in the interest rates used to calculate the present value of future plan obligations or government regulations that increase minimum funding requirements or the pension liability In addition to affecting CenterPoint Energys funding requirements these factors could adversely affect our results of operations liquidity and financial position We may be significantly affected by changes in federal income tax laws and regulations including any comprehensive federal tax reform legislation Our businesses are impacted by US federal income tax policy Under the Biden administration with the Senate and House of Representatives controlled by the Democratic Party comprehensive federal tax reform legislation could be enacted that may significantly change the federal income tax laws applicable to domestic businesses including changes that may increase the federal income tax rate and impact investment incentives and deductions for depreciation and interest among other deductions While CenterPoint Energy and its subsidiaries cannot assess the overall impact of any such potential legislation on our businesses it is possible that our results of operations financial conditions or cash flows could be negatively impacted Furthermore with any enacted federal tax reform legislation it is uncertain how state commissions and local municipalities may require us to respond to the effects of such tax legislation including determining the treatment of EDIT and other increases and decreases in our revenue requirements As such potential regulatory actions in response to any enacted tax legislation could adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows We are involved in numerous legal proceedings the outcomes of which are uncertain and resolutions adverse to us could negatively affect our financial results The Registrants are subject to numerous legal proceedings the most significant of which are summarized in Note 16 to the Registrants respective consolidated financial statements Litigation is subject to many uncertainties and the Registrants cannot predict the outcome of all matters with assurance Additionally under some circumstances the Registrants could potentially have claims filed against them or incur liabilities associated with assets and businesses no longer owned by them as a result of sales divestitures or other transfers to third parties who may be unable to fulfill their indemnity obligations to the Registrants Final resolution of these matters or any potential future claims or liabilities may require additional expenditures over an extended period of time that may be in excess of established insurance or reserves and may have a material adverse effect on the Registrants financial results Our businesses may be adversely affected by the intentional misconduct of our employees We are committed to living our core values of safety integrity accountability initiative and respect and complying with all applicable laws and regulations Despite that commitment and our efforts to prevent misconduct it is possible for employees to engage in intentional misconduct fail to uphold our core values and violate laws and regulations for individual gain through contract or procurement fraud misappropriation bribery or corruption fraudulent relatedparty transactions and serious breaches of our Ethics and Compliance Code and Standards of ConductBusiness Ethics policy among other policies If such intentional misconduct by employees should occur it could result in substantial liability higher costs increased regulatory scrutiny and negative public perceptions any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows Item 1B Unresolved Staff Comments None 40 Item 2 Properties The following discussion is based on the Registrants
