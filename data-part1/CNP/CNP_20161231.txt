Transmission  Distribution Houston Electric is a transmission and distribution electric utility that operates wholly within the state of Texas Neither Houston Electric nor any other subsidiary of CenterPoint Energy makes direct retail or wholesale sales of electric energy or owns or operates any electric generating facilities 1 Electric Transmission On behalf of REPs Houston Electric delivers electricity from power plants to substations from one substation to another and to retail electric customers taking power at or above 69 kilovolts in locations throughout Houston Electrics certificated service territory Houston Electric constructs and maintains transmission facilities and provides transmission services under tariffs approved by the PUCT Electric Distribution In ERCOT end users purchase their electricity directly from certificated REPs Houston Electric delivers electricity for REPs in its certificated service area by carrying lowervoltage power from the substation to the retail electric customer Houston Electrics distribution network receives electricity from the transmission grid through power distribution substations and delivers electricity to end users through distribution feeders Houston Electrics operations include construction and maintenance of distribution facilities metering services outage response services and call center operations Houston Electric provides distribution services under tariffs approved by the PUCT PUCT rules and market protocols govern the commercial operations of distribution companies and other market participants Rates for these existing services are established pursuant to rate proceedings conducted before municipalities that have original jurisdiction and the PUCT ERCOT Market Framework Houston Electric is a member of ERCOT Within ERCOT prices for wholesale generation and retail electric sales are unregulated but services provided by transmission and distribution companies such as Houston Electric are regulated by the PUCT ERCOT serves as the regional reliability coordinating council for member electric power systems in most of Texas ERCOT membership is open to consumer groups investor and municipallyowned electric utilities rural electric cooperatives independent generators power marketers river authorities and REPs The ERCOT market includes most of the State of Texas other than a portion of the panhandle portions of the eastern part of the state bordering Arkansas and Louisiana and the area in and around El Paso The ERCOT market represents approximately 90 of the demand for power in Texas and is one of the nations largest power markets The ERCOT market included available generating capacity of over 78000 megawatts as of December 31 2016  Currently there are only limited direct current interconnections between the ERCOT market and other power markets in the United States and Mexico The ERCOT market operates under the reliability standards set by the NERC and approved by the FERC Within ERCOT these reliability standards are administered by the TRE The PUCT has primary jurisdiction over the ERCOT market to ensure the adequacy and reliability of electricity supply across the states main interconnected power transmission grid The ERCOT ISO is responsible for operating the bulk electric power supply system in the ERCOT market Its responsibilities include ensuring that electricity production and delivery are accurately accounted for among the generation resources and wholesale buyers and sellers Houston Electrics electric transmission business along with those of other owners of transmission facilities in Texas supports the operation of the ERCOT ISO The transmission business has planning design construction operation and maintenance responsibility for the portion of the transmission grid and for the loadserving substations it owns primarily within its certificated area Houston Electric participates with the ERCOT ISO and other ERCOT utilities to plan design obtain regulatory approval for and construct new transmission lines necessary to increase bulk power transfer capability and to remove existing constraints on the ERCOT transmission grid Restructuring of the Texas Electric Market In 1999 the Texas legislature adopted the Texas Electric Choice Plan Texas electric restructuring law Pursuant to that legislation integrated electric utilities operating within ERCOT were required to unbundle their integrated operations into separate retail sales power generation and transmission and distribution companies The legislation provided for a transition period to move to the new market structure and provided a mechanism for the formerly integrated electric utilities to recover stranded and certain other costs resulting from the transition to competition Those costs were recoverable after approval by the PUCT either through the issuance of securitization bonds or through the implementation of a competition transition charge as a rider to the utilitys tariff Houston Electrics integrated utility business was restructured in accordance with the Texas electric restructuring law and its generating stations were sold to third parties Ultimately Houston Electric was authorized to recover a total of approximately 5 billion in stranded costs other charges and related interest Most of that amount was recovered through the issuance of transition bonds by special purpose subsidiaries of Houston Electric The transition bonds are repaid through charges imposed on customers in Houston Electrics service territory As of December 31 2016  approximately 19 billion aggregate principal amount of transition bonds were outstanding 2 Customers Houston Electric serves nearly all of the HoustonGalveston metropolitan area At December 31 2016  Houston Electrics customers consisted of approximately 64 REPs which sell electricity to more than 24 million metered customers in Houston Electrics certificated service area and municipalities electric cooperatives and other distribution companies located outside Houston Electrics certificated service area Each REP is licensed by and must meet minimum creditworthiness criteria established by the PUCT Sales to REPs that are affiliates of NRG represented approximately 34 35 and 37 of Houston Electrics transmission and distribution revenues in 2016  2015 and 2014  respectively Sales to REPs that are affiliates of Energy Future Holdings represented approximately 11 10 and 10 of Houston Electrics transmission and distribution revenues in 2016  2015 and 2014  respectively Houston Electrics aggregate billed receivables balance from REPs as of December 31 2016 was 193 million Approximately 33 and 12 of this amount was owed by affiliates of NRG and Energy Future Holdings respectively Houston Electric does not have longterm contracts with any of its customers It operates using a continuous billing cycle with meter readings being conducted and invoices being distributed to REPs each business day AMS In May 2012 Houston Electric substantially completed the deployment of an AMS having installed approximately 22 million smart meters To recover the cost of the AMS the PUCT approved a monthly surcharge payable by REPs initially over 12 years and later reduced to six years as a result of DOE grant funds The surcharge expired in 2015 and 2016 for residential customers and certain nonresidential customers respectively and is set to expire in 2017 for the remaining nonresidential customers The surcharge amounts and duration are subject to adjustment in future proceedings to reflect actual costs incurred and to address required changes in scope Competition There are no other electric transmission and distribution utilities in Houston Electrics service area For another provider of transmission and distribution services to provide such services in Houston Electrics territory it would be required to obtain a certificate of convenience and necessity from the PUCT and depending on the location of the facilities may also be required to obtain franchises from one or more municipalities We know of no other party intending to enter this business in Houston Electrics service area at this time Distributed generation ie power generation located at or near the point of consumption could result in a reduction of demand for Houston Electrics electric distribution services but has not been a significant factor to date Seasonality A significant portion of Houston Electrics revenues is derived from rates that it collects from each REP based on the amount of electricity it delivers on behalf of that REP Thus Houston Electrics revenues and results of operations are subject to seasonality weather conditions and other changes in electricity usage with revenues generally being higher during the warmer months Properties All of Houston Electrics properties are located in Texas Its properties consist primarily of highvoltage electric transmission lines and poles distribution lines substations service centers service wires and meters Most of Houston Electrics transmission and distribution lines have been constructed over lands of others pursuant to easements or along public highways and streets under franchise agreements and as permitted by law All real and tangible properties of Houston Electric subject to certain exclusions are currently subject to  the lien of a Mortgage and Deed of Trust the Mortgage dated November 1 1944 as supplemented and  the lien of a General Mortgage the General Mortgage dated October 10 2002 as supplemented which is junior to the lien of the Mortgage As of December 31 2016  Houston Electric had approximately 26 billion aggregate principal amount of general mortgage bonds outstanding under the General Mortgage including approximately 118 million held in trust to secure pollution control bonds for which we are obligated Additionally as of December 31 2016  Houston Electric had approximately 102 million aggregate principal amount of first mortgage bonds outstanding under the Mortgage Houston Electric may issue additional general 3 mortgage bonds on the basis of retired bonds 70 of property additions or cash deposited with the trustee Approximately 41 billion of additional first mortgage bonds and general mortgage bonds in the aggregate could be issued on the basis of retired bonds and 70 of property additions as of December 31 2016  However Houston Electric has contractually agreed that it will not issue additional first mortgage bonds subject to certain exceptions Electric Lines  Overhead As of December 31 2016  Houston Electric owned 28702 pole miles of overhead distribution lines and 3692 circuit miles of overhead transmission lines including 287 circuit miles operated at 69000 volts 2188 circuit miles operated at 138000 volts and 1217 circuit miles operated at 345000 volts Electric Lines  Underground As of December 31 2016  Houston Electric owned 23937 circuit miles of underground distribution lines and 26 circuit miles of underground transmission lines including two circuit miles operated at 69000 volts and 24 circuit miles operated at 138000 volts Substations As of December 31 2016  Houston Electric owned 232 major substation sites having a total installed rated transformer capacity of 60854 megavolt amperes Service Centers Houston Electric operates 14 regional service centers located on a total of 292 acres of land These service centers consist of office buildings warehouses and repair facilities that are used in the business of transmitting and distributing electricity Franchises Houston Electric holds nonexclusive franchises from certain incorporated municipalities in its service territory In exchange for the payment of fees these franchises give Houston Electric the right to use the streets and public rightsofway of these municipalities to construct operate and maintain its transmission and distribution system and to use that system to conduct its electric delivery business and for other purposes that the franchises permit The terms of the franchises with various expiration dates typically range from 20 to 40 years Natural Gas Distribution CERC Corps NGD engages in regulated intrastate natural gas sales to and natural gas transportation and storage for approximately 34 million residential commercial industrial and transportation customers in Arkansas Louisiana Minnesota Mississippi Oklahoma and Texas The largest metropolitan areas served in each state by NGD are Houston Texas Minneapolis Minnesota Little Rock Arkansas Shreveport Louisiana Biloxi Mississippi and Lawton Oklahoma In 2016  approximately 37 of NGDs total throughput was to residential customers and approximately 63 was to commercial and industrial and transportation customers The table below reflects the number of NGD customers by state as of December 31 2016  Residential Commercial Industrial Total Customers Arkansas 379117 48161 427278 Louisiana 230475 16842 247317 Minnesota 778731 69856 848587 Mississippi 112992 12548 125540 Oklahoma 89419 10785 100204 Texas 1592804 97614 1690418 Total NGD 3183538 255806 3439344 NGD also provides unregulated services in Minnesota consisting of residential appliance repair and maintenance services along with HVAC equipment sales Seasonality The demand for intrastate natural gas sales to residential customers and natural gas sales and transportation for commercial and industrial customers is seasonal In 2016  approximately 66 of NGDs total throughput occurred in the first and fourth quarters These patterns reflect the higher demand for natural gas for heating purposes during the colder months 4 Supply and Transportation In 2016  NGD purchased virtually all of its natural gas supply pursuant to contracts with remaining terms varying from a few months to four years Major suppliers in 2016 included the following Supplier Percent of Supply Volumes BP Energy CompanyBP Canada Energy Marketing 177 Macquarie Energy 163 Tenaska Marketing Ventures 140 Sequent Energy Management 80 Kinder Morgan Tejas PipelineKinder Morgan Texas Pipeline 71 One Nation Energy Solutions 33 Laclede Energy Resources 29 Mieco 26 CES 25 Twin Eagle Resource Management 22 Numerous other suppliers provided the remaining 234 of NGDs natural gas supply requirements NGD transports its natural gas supplies through various intrastate and interstate pipelines under contracts with remaining terms including extensions varying from one to fifteen years NGD anticipates that these gas supply and transportation contracts will be renewed or replaced prior to their expiration NGD actively engages in commodity price stabilization pursuant to annual gas supply plans presented to andor filed with each of its state regulatory authorities These price stabilization activities include use of storage gas and contractually establishing structured prices eg fixed price costless collars and caps with our physical gas suppliers Its gas supply plans generally call for 5075 of winter supplies to be stabilized in some fashion The regulations of the states in which NGD operates allow it to pass through changes in the cost of natural gas including savings and costs of financial derivatives associated with the indexpriced physical supply to its customers under purchased gas adjustment provisions in its tariffs Depending upon the jurisdiction the purchased gas adjustment factors are updated periodically ranging from monthly to semiannually The changes in the cost of gas billed to customers are subject to review by the applicable regulatory bodies NGD uses various thirdparty storage services or owned natural gas storage facilities to meet peakday requirements and to manage the daily changes in demand due to changes in weather NGD may also supplement contracted supplies and storage from time to time with stored LNG and propaneair plant production NGD owns and operates an underground natural gas storage facility with a capacity of 70 Bcf It has a working capacity of 20 Bcf available for use during the heating season and a maximum daily withdrawal rate of 50 MMcf It also owns eight propaneair plants with a total production rate of 180000 Dth per day and onsite storage facilities for 12 million gallons of propane 10 Bcf natural gas equivalent It owns a LNG plant facility with a 12 milliongallon LNG storage tank 10 Bcf natural gas equivalent and a production rate of 72000 Dth per day On an ongoing basis NGD enters into contracts to provide sufficient supplies and pipeline capacity to meet its customer requirements However it is possible for limited service disruptions to occur from time to time due to weather conditions transportation constraints and other events As a result of these factors supplies of natural gas may become unavailable from time to time or prices may increase rapidly in response to temporary supply constraints or other factors NGD has had AMAs associated with its utility distribution service in Arkansas Louisiana Mississippi Oklahoma and Texas Generally AMAs are contracts between NGD and an asset manager that are intended to transfer the working capital obligation and maximize the utilization of the assets In these agreements NGD agrees to release transportation and storage capacity to other parties to manage natural gas storage supply and delivery arrangements for NGD and to use the released capacity for other purposes when it is not needed for NGD NGD is compensated by the asset manager through payments made over the life of the agreements based in part on the results of the asset optimization NGD has an obligation to purchase its winter storage requirements that have been released to the asset manager under these AMAs NGD has received approval from the state regulatory commissions in Arkansas Louisiana Mississippi and Oklahoma to retain a share of the AMA proceeds NGD currently has AMAs in Arkansas north Louisiana and Oklahoma that extend through 2020 5 Assets As of December 31 2016  NGD owned approximately 74000 linear miles of natural gas distribution mains varying in size from onehalf inch to 24 inches in diameter Generally in each of the cities towns and rural areas served by NGD it owns the underground gas mains and service lines metering and regulating equipment located on customers premises and the district regulating equipment necessary for pressure maintenance With a few exceptions the measuring stations at which NGD receives gas are owned operated and maintained by others and its distribution facilities begin at the outlet of the measuring equipment These facilities including odorizing equipment are usually located on land owned by suppliers Competition NGD competes primarily with alternate energy sources such as electricity and other fuel sources In some areas intrastate pipelines other gas distributors and marketers also compete directly for gas sales to end users In addition as a result of federal regulations affecting interstate pipelines natural gas marketers operating on these pipelines may be able to bypass NGDs facilities and market and sell andor transport natural gas directly to commercial and industrial customers Energy Services CERC offers competitive variable and fixedpriced physical natural gas supplies primarily to commercial and industrial customers and electric and natural gas utilities through CES and its subsidiary CEIP In 2016  CES marketed approximately 777 Bcf of natural gas related energy services and transportation to approximately 31000 customers including approximately 8 Bcf to affiliates in 31 states These totals include approximately 13000 customers and 175 Bcf of natural gas related to the acquisition of Continuum which closed in April 2016 and was fully integrated into CES by the end of 2016 CES customers vary in size from small commercial customers to large utility companies Not included in the 2016 customer count are approximately 60000 natural gas customers that are served under residential and small commercial choice programs invoiced by their host utility These customers are not included in customer count so as not to distort the significant margin impact from the remaining customer base In January 2017 CES completed the acquisition of AEM For information related to this acquisition see Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements CES offers a variety of natural gas management services to gas utilities large industrial customers electric generators smaller commercial and industrial customers municipalities educational institutions and hospitals These services include load forecasting supply acquisition daily swing volume management invoice consolidation storage asset management firm and interruptible transportation administration and forward price management CES also offers a portfolio of physical delivery services designed to meet customers supply and price risk management needs These customers are served directly through interconnects with various interstate and intrastate pipeline companies and portably through our mobile energy solutions business In addition to offering natural gas management services CES procures and optimizes transportation and storage assets CES maintains a portfolio of natural gas supply contracts and firm transportation and storage agreements to meet the natural gas requirements of its customers CES aggregates supply from various producing regions and offers contracts to buy natural gas with terms ranging from one month to over five years In addition CES actively participates in the spot natural gas markets in an effort to balance daily and monthly purchases and sales obligations Natural gas supply and transportation capabilities are leveraged through contracts for ancillary services including physical storage and other balancing arrangements As described above CES offers its customers a variety of load following services In providing these services CES uses its customers purchase commitments to forecast and arrange its own supply purchases storage and transportation services to serve customers natural gas requirements As a result of the variance between this forecast activity and the actual monthly activity CES will either have too much supply or too little supply relative to its customers purchase commitments These supply imbalances arise each month as customers natural gas requirements are scheduled and corresponding natural gas supplies are nominated by CES for delivery to those customers CES processes and risk control environment are designed to measure and value imbalances on a realtime basis to ensure that CES exposure to commodity price risk is kept to a minimum The value assigned to these imbalances is calculated daily and is known as the aggregate VaR Our risk control policy which is overseen by our Risk Oversight Committee defines authorized and prohibited trading instruments and trading limits CES is a physical marketer of natural gas and uses a variety of tools including pipeline and storage capacity financial instruments and physical commodity purchase contracts to support its sales CES optimizes its use of these 6 various tools to minimize its supply costs and does not engage in speculative commodity trading The VaR limit within which CES currently operates a 4 million maximum set by the board of directors is consistent with CES operational objective of matching its aggregate sales obligations including the swing associated with load following services with its supply portfolio in a manner that minimizes its total cost of supply In 2016  CES VaR averaged 02 million with a high of 10 million Assets CEIP owns and operates over 200 miles of intrastate pipeline in Louisiana and Texas In addition CES leases transportation capacity on various interstate and intrastate pipelines and storage to service its shippers and end users Competition CES competes with regional and national wholesale and retail gas marketers including the marketing divisions of natural gas producers and utilities In addition CES competes with intrastate pipelines for customers and services in its market areas Midstream Investments Our Midstream Investments business segment consists of CERC Corps equity method investment in Enable Enable is a publicly traded MLP jointly controlled by CERC Corp and OGE Enable Enable was formed to own operate and develop strategically located natural gas and crude oil infrastructure assets Enable serves current and emerging production areas in the United States including several unconventional shale resource plays and local and regional enduser markets in the United States Enables assets and operations are organized into two reportable segments i gathering and processing which primarily provides natural gas gathering processing and fractionation services and crude oil gathering for its producer customers and ii transportation and storage which provides interstate and intrastate natural gas pipeline transportation and storage services primarily to natural gas producers utilities and industrial customers Enables natural gas gathering and processing assets are located in OklahomaTexas Arkansas Louisiana and Mississippi and serve natural gas production in the Anadarko Arkoma and ArkLaTex basins Enable also owns a crude oil gathering business located in North Dakota that commenced initial operations in November 2013 to serve shale development in the Bakken Shale formation of the Williston Basin Enables natural gas transportation and storage assets extend from western Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle to Alabama and from Louisiana to Illinois Enables Gathering and Processing segment Enable provides gathering compression treating dehydration processing and NGLs fractionation for producers who are active in the areas in which Enable operates Enables superheader system is intended to optimize the economics of its natural gas processing and to improve system utilization and reliability Enables gathering and processing systems compete with gatherers and processors of all types and sizes including those affiliated with various producers other major pipeline companies and various independent midstream entities In the process of selling NGLs Enable competes against other natural gas processors extracting and selling NGLs Enables primary competitors are master limited partnerships who are active in the regions where it operates Enables Transportation and Storage segment Enable provides feebased interstate and intrastate transportation and storage services across nine states Enables transportation and storage assets were designed and built to serve large natural gas and electric utility companies in its areas of operation Enables interstate pipelines compete with other interstate and intrastate pipelines Enables intrastate pipeline system competes with numerous interstate and intrastate pipelines including several of the interconnected pipelines discussed above as well as other natural gas storage facilities The principal elements of competition among pipelines are rates terms of service and flexibility and reliability of service For information related to CERC Corps equity method investment in Enable see Notes 2b 10 and 19 to our consolidated financial statements Other Operations Our Other Operations business segment includes office buildings and other real estate used in our business operations and other corporate operations that support all of our business operations 7 Financial Information About Segments For financial information about our segments see Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements which note is incorporated herein by reference REGULATION We are subject to regulation by various federal state and local governmental agencies including the regulations described below Federal Energy Regulatory Commission The FERC has jurisdiction under the NGA and the NGPA as amended to regulate the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce and natural gas sales for resale in interstate commerce that are not first sales The FERC regulates among other things the construction of pipeline and related facilities used in the transportation and storage of natural gas in interstate commerce including the extension expansion or abandonment of these facilities The FERC has authority to prohibit market manipulation in connection with FERCregulated transactions and to impose significant civil and criminal penalties for statutory violations and violations of the FERCs rules or orders Our Energy Services business segment markets natural gas in interstate commerce pursuant to blanket authority granted by the FERC Houston Electric is not a public utility under the Federal Power Act and therefore is not generally regulated by the FERC although certain of its transactions are subject to limited FERC jurisdiction The FERC has certain responsibilities with respect to ensuring the reliability of electric transmission service including transmission facilities owned by Houston Electric and other utilities within ERCOT The FERC has designated the NERC as the ERO to promulgate standards under FERC oversight for all owners operators and users of the bulk power system Electric Entities The ERO and the FERC have authority to a impose fines and other sanctions on Electric Entities that fail to comply with approved standards and b audit compliance with approved standards The FERC has approved the delegation by the NERC of authority for reliability in ERCOT to the TRE Houston Electric does not anticipate that the reliability standards proposed by the NERC and approved by the FERC will have a material adverse impact on its operations To the extent that Houston Electric is required to make additional expenditures to comply with these standards it is anticipated that Houston Electric will seek to recover those costs through the transmission charges that are imposed on all distribution service providers within ERCOT for electric transmission provided As a public utility holding company under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 we and our consolidated subsidiaries are subject to reporting and accounting requirements and are required to maintain certain books and records and make them available for review by the FERC and state regulatory authorities in certain circumstances State and Local Regulation  Electric Transmission  Distribution Houston Electric conducts its operations pursuant to a certificate of convenience and necessity issued by the PUCT that covers its present service area and facilities The PUCT and certain municipalities have the authority to set the rates and terms of service provided by Houston Electric under costofservice rate regulation Houston Electric holds nonexclusive franchises from certain incorporated municipalities in its service territory In exchange for payment of fees these franchises give Houston Electric the right to use the streets and public rightsofway of these municipalities to construct operate and maintain its transmission and distribution system and to use that system to conduct its electric delivery business and for other purposes that the franchises permit The terms of the franchises with various expiration dates typically range from 20 to 40 years Houston Electrics distribution rates charged to REPs for residential customers are primarily based on amounts of energy delivered whereas distribution rates for a majority of commercial and industrial customers are primarily based on peak demand All REPs in Houston Electrics service area pay the same rates and other charges for transmission and distribution services This regulated delivery charge includes the transmission and distribution rate which includes municipal franchise fees a distribution recovery mechanism for recovery of incremental distributioninvested capital above that which is already reflected in the base distribution rate a nuclear decommissioning charge associated with decommissioning the South Texas nuclear generating facility an EECR charge a surcharge related to the implementation of AMS and charges associated with securitization of regulatory assets stranded costs and restoration costs relating to Hurricane Ike Transmission rates charged to distribution companies are based on amounts of energy transmitted under postage stamp rates that do not vary with the distance the energy is being transmitted All distribution companies in ERCOT pay Houston Electric the same rates and other charges for transmission services 8 For a discussion of certain of Houston Electrics ongoing regulatory proceedings see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Regulatory Matters in Item 7 of Part II of this report which discussion is incorporated herein by reference State and Local Regulation  Natural Gas Distribution In almost all communities in which NGD provides natural gas distribution services it operates under franchises certificates or licenses obtained from state and local authorities The original terms of the franchises with various expiration dates typically range from 10 to 30 years although franchises in Arkansas are perpetual NGD expects to be able to renew expiring franchises In most cases franchises to provide natural gas utility services are not exclusive Substantially all of NGD is subject to costofservice rate regulation by the relevant state public utility commissions and in Texas by the Railroad Commission and those municipalities served by NGD that have retained original jurisdiction In certain of its jurisdictions NGD has in effect annual rate adjustment mechanisms that provide for changes in rates dependent upon certain changes in invested capital earned returns on equity or actual margins realized For a discussion of certain of NGDs ongoing regulatory proceedings see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Regulatory Matters in Item 7 of Part II of this report which discussion is incorporated herein by reference Department of Transportation In December 2006 Congress enacted the 2006 Act which reauthorized the programs adopted under the 2002 Act These programs included several requirements related to ensuring pipeline safety and a requirement to assess the integrity of pipeline transmission facilities in areas of high population concentration Pursuant to the 2006 Act PHMSA at the DOT issued regulations effective February 12 2010 requiring operators of gas distribution pipelines to develop and implement integrity management programs similar to those required for gas transmission pipelines but tailored to reflect the differences in distribution pipelines Operators of natural gas distribution systems were required to write and implement their integrity management programs by August 2 2011 Our natural gas distribution systems met this deadline Pursuant to the 2002 Act and the 2006 Act PHMSA has adopted a number of rules concerning among other things distinguishing between gathering lines and transmission facilities requiring certain design and construction features in new and replaced lines to reduce corrosion and requiring pipeline operators to amend existing written operations and maintenance procedures and operator qualification programs PHMSA also updated its reporting requirements for natural gas pipelines effective January 1 2011 In December 2011 Congress passed the 2011 Act This act increases the maximum civil penalties for pipeline safety administrative enforcement actions requires the DOT to study and report on the expansion of integrity management requirements and the sufficiency of existing gathering line regulations to ensure safety requires pipeline operators to verify their records on maximum allowable operating pressure and imposes new emergency response and incident notification requirements In 2016 the 2016 Act reauthorized PHMSAs pipeline safety programs through 2019 and provided limited new authority including the ability to issue emergency orders to set inspection requirements for certain underwater pipelines and to promulgate minimum safety standards for natural gas storage facilities as well as to provide increased transparency into the status of asyetincomplete PHMSA actions required by the 2011 Act We anticipate that compliance with PHMSAs regulations performance of the remediation activities by CERCs natural gas distribution companies and intrastate pipelines and verification of records on maximum allowable operating pressure will continue to require increases in both capital expenditures and operating costs The level of expenditures will depend upon several factors including age location and operating pressures of the facilities In particular the cost of compliance with the DOTs integrity management rules will depend on integrity testing and the repairs found to be necessary by such testing Changes to the amount of pipe subject to integrity management whether by expansion of the definition of the type of areas subject to integrity management procedures or of the applicability of such procedures outside of those defined areas may also affect the costs we incur Implementation of the 2011 and 2016 Acts by PHMSA may result in other regulations or the reinterpretation of existing regulations that could impact our compliance costs In addition we may be subject to the DOTs enforcement actions and penalties if we fail to comply with pipeline regulations 9 Midstream Investments  Rate and Other Regulation Federal state and local regulation may

add an antimanipulation provision that makes it unlawful for any entity to engage in prohibited behavior as prescribed in FERC rules which were subsequently issued in FERC Order No 670 The EPAct of 2005 also amends the NGA and the NGPA to give the FERC authority to impose civil penalties for violations of these statutes and FERCs regulations rules and orders of up to 1 million per day per violation subject to periodic adjustment to account for inflation Should Enable fail to comply with all applicable FERCadministered statutes rules regulations and orders it could be subject to substantial penalties and fines In addition the CFTC is directed under the CEA to prevent price manipulations for the commodity and futures markets including the energy futures markets Pursuant to the DoddFrank Act and other authority the CFTC has adopted antimarket manipulation regulations that prohibit fraud and price manipulation in the commodity and futures markets The CFTC also has statutory authority to seek civil penalties of up to the greater of 1 million or triple the monetary gain to the violator for violations of the antimarket manipulation sections of the CEA These maximum penalty levels are also subject to periodic adjustment to account for inflation Intrastate Natural Gas Pipeline and Storage Regulation Intrastate natural gas transportation is largely regulated by the state in which the transportation takes place However an intrastate natural gas pipeline system may transport natural gas in interstate commerce provided that the rates terms and conditions of such transportation service comply with FERC regulation and Section 311 of the NGPA and Part 284 of the FERCs regulations Rates for service pursuant to Section 311 of the NGPA are generally subject to review and approval by the FERC at least once every five years Failure to observe the service limitations applicable to transportation services provided under Section 311 failure to comply with the rates approved by the FERC for Section 311 service or failure to comply with the terms and conditions of service established in the pipelines FERCapproved Statement of Operating Conditions could result in the assertion of federal NGA jurisdiction by the FERC andor the imposition of administrative civil and criminal penalties as described under Interstate Natural Gas Pipeline Regulation above Natural Gas Gathering Pipeline Regulation Section 1b of the NGA exempts natural gas gathering facilities from the jurisdiction of the FERC Although the FERC has not made formal determinations with respect to all of the facilities Enable considers to be gathering facilities Enable believes that its natural gas pipelines meet the traditional tests that the FERC has used to determine that a pipeline is a gathering pipeline and is therefore not subject to FERC jurisdiction The distinction however has been the subject of substantial litigation and the FERC determines whether facilities are gathering facilities on a casebycase basis so the classification and regulation of Enables gathering facilities is subject to change based on future determinations States may regulate gathering pipelines State regulation generally includes various safety environmental and in some circumstances antidiscrimination requirements and in some instances complaintbased rate regulation Enables gathering operations may be subject to ratable take and common purchaser statutes in the states in which they operate Enables gathering operations could be adversely affected should they be subject in the future to the application of state or federal regulation of rates and services Enables gathering operations could also be subject to additional safety and operational regulations relating to the design construction testing operation replacement and maintenance of gathering facilities We cannot predict what effect if any such changes might have on Enables operations but the industry could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased costs depending on future legislative and regulatory changes 10 Crude Oil Gathering Regulation Enable provides interstate transportation on its crude oil gathering system in North Dakota pursuant to a public tariff in accordance with FERC regulatory requirements Crude oil gathering pipelines that provide interstate transportation service may be regulated as a common carrier by the FERC under the ICA the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and the rules and regulations promulgated under those laws The ICA and FERC regulations require that rates for interstate service pipelines that transport crude oil and refined petroleum products collectively referred to as petroleum pipelines and certain other liquids be just and reasonable and nondiscriminatory or not conferring any undue preference upon any shipper FERC regulations also require interstate common carrier petroleum pipelines to file with the FERC and publicly post tariffs stating their interstate transportation rates and terms and conditions of service Safety and Health Regulation Certain of Enables facilities are subject to pipeline safety regulations PHMSA regulates safety requirements in the design construction operation and maintenance of jurisdictional natural gas and hazardous liquid pipeline facilities All natural gas transmission facilities such as Enables interstate natural gas pipelines are subject to PHMSAs regulations but natural gas gathering pipelines are subject only to the extent they are classified as regulated gathering pipelines In addition several NGL pipeline facilities and crude oil pipeline facilities are regulated as hazardous liquids pipelines Pursuant to various federal statutes including the NGPSA the DOT through PHMSA regulates pipeline safety and integrity NGL and crude oil pipelines are subject to regulation by PHMSA under the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Act which requires PHMSA to develop prescribe and enforce minimum federal safety standards for the transportation of hazardous liquids by pipeline and comparable state statutes with respect to design installation testing construction operation replacement and management of pipeline facilities Should Enable fail to comply with DOT or comparable state regulations it could be subject to penalties and fines If future DOT pipeline regulations were to require that Enable expand its integrity management program to currently unregulated pipelines costs associated with compliance may have a material effect on its operations ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Our operations and the operations of Enable are subject to stringent and complex laws and regulations pertaining to the environment As an owner or operator of natural gas pipelines distribution systems and storage electric transmission and distribution systems and the facilities that support these systems we must comply with these laws and regulations at the federal state and local levels These laws and regulations can restrict or impact our business activities in many ways such as  restricting the way we can handle or dispose of wastes  limiting or prohibiting construction activities in sensitive areas such as wetlands coastal regions or areas inhabited by endangered species  requiring remedial action to mitigate environmental conditions caused by our operations or attributable to former operations  enjoining the operations of facilities with permits issued pursuant to such environmental laws and regulations and  impacting the demand for our services by directly or indirectly affecting the use or price of natural gas To comply with these requirements we may need to spend substantial amounts and devote other resources from time to time to among other activities  construct or acquire new facilities and equipment  acquire permits for facility operations  modify upgrade or replace existing and proposed equipment and  clean or decommission waste management areas fuel storage facilities and other locations Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative civil and criminal enforcement measures including the assessment of monetary penalties the imposition of remedial actions and the issuance of orders enjoining 11 future operations Certain environmental statutes impose strict joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where hazardous substances have been stored disposed or released Moreover it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other waste products into the environment The recent trend in environmental regulation has been to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may impact the environment For example the EPA has established air emission control requirements for natural gas and NGL production processing and transportation activities which may affect Enables midstream operations These include New Source Performance Standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds and the NESHAPS to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with natural gas production and processing activities There can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate We try to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and plan accordingly to maintain compliance with changing environmental laws and regulations and to ensure the costs of such compliance are reasonable Based on current regulatory requirements and interpretations we do not believe that compliance with federal state or local environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows In addition we believe that our current environmental remediation activities will not materially interrupt or diminish our operational ability We cannot assure you that future events such as changes in existing laws the promulgation of new laws or the development or discovery of new facts or conditions will not cause us to incur significant costs The following is a discussion of material current environmental and safety laws and regulations that relate to our operations We believe that we are in substantial compliance with these environmental laws and regulations Global Climate Change There is increasing attention being paid in the United States and worldwide to the issue of climate change As a result from time to time regulatory agencies have considered the modification of existing laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations addressing the emissions of GHG on the state federal or international level Some of the proposals would require industrial sources to meet stringent new standards that would require substantial reductions in GHG emissions CERCs revenues operating costs and capital requirements could be adversely affected as a result of any regulatory action that would require installation of new control technologies or a modification of its operations or would have the effect of reducing the consumption of natural gas Our electric transmission and distribution business in contrast to some electric utilities does not generate electricity and thus is not directly exposed to the risk of high capital costs and regulatory uncertainties that face electric utilities that burn fossil fuels to generate electricity Nevertheless Houston Electrics revenues could be adversely affected to the extent any resulting regulatory action has the effect of reducing consumption of electricity by ultimate consumers within its service territory Likewise incentives to conserve energy or use energy sources other than natural gas could result in a decrease in demand for our services Conversely regulatory actions that effectively promote the consumption of natural gas because of its lower emissions characteristics would be expected to beneficially affect CERC and its natural gasrelated businesses At this point in time however it would be speculative to try to quantify the magnitude of the impacts from possible new regulatory actions related to GHG emissions either positive or negative on our businesses To the extent climate changes occur our businesses may be adversely impacted though we believe any such impacts are likely to occur very gradually and hence would be difficult to quantify To the extent global climate change results in warmer temperatures in our service territories financial results from our natural gas distribution business could be adversely affected through lower gas sales On the other hand warmer temperatures in our electric service territory may increase our revenues from transmission and distribution through increased demand for electricity for cooling Another possible result of climate change is more frequent and more severe weather events such as hurricanes or tornadoes Since many of our facilities are located along or near the Gulf Coast increased or more severe hurricanes or tornadoes could increase our costs to repair damaged facilities and restore service to our customers When we cannot deliver electricity or natural gas to customers or our customers cannot receive our services our financial results can be impacted by lost revenues and we generally must seek approval from regulators to recover restoration costs To the extent we are unable to recover those costs or if higher rates resulting from our recovery of such costs result in reduced demand for our services our future financial results may be adversely impacted Air Emissions Our operations are subject to the federal Clean Air Act and comparable state laws and regulations These laws and regulations regulate emissions of air pollutants from various industrial sources including processing plants and compressor stations and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements Such laws and regulations may require preapproval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce air emissions or result in the increase of existing air emissions 12 We may be required to obtain and strictly comply with air permits containing various emissions and operational limitations or utilize specific emission control technologies to limit emissions Failure to comply with these requirements could result in monetary penalties injunctions conditions or restrictions on operations and potentially criminal enforcement actions We may be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment in connection with obtaining and maintaining operating permits and approvals for air emissions The EPA has established new air emission control requirements for natural gas and NGLs production processing and transportation activities Under the NESHAPS the EPA established maximum achievable control technology for stationary internal combustion engines sometimes referred to as the RICE MACT rule Compressors and back up electrical generators used by our Natural Gas Distribution business segment and back up electrical generators used by our Electric Transmission  Distribution business segment are substantially compliant with these laws and regulations Water Discharges Our operations are subject to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 as amended also known as the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws and regulations These laws and regulations impose detailed requirements and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into waters of the United States The unpermitted discharge of pollutants including discharges resulting from a spill or leak incident is prohibited The Clean Water Act and regulations implemented thereunder also prohibit discharges of dredged and fill material in wetlands and other waters of the United States unless authorized by an appropriately issued permit Any unpermitted release of petroleum or other pollutants from our pipelines or facilities could result in fines or penalties as well as significant remedial obligations Hazardous Waste Our operations generate wastes including some hazardous wastes that are subject to the federal RCRA and comparable state laws which impose detailed requirements for the handling storage treatment transport and disposal of hazardous and solid waste RCRA currently exempts many natural gas gathering and field processing wastes from classification as hazardous waste Specifically RCRA excludes from the definition of hazardous waste waters produced and other wastes associated with the exploration development or production of crude oil and natural gas However these oil and gas exploration and production wastes are still regulated under state law and the less stringent nonhazardous waste requirements of RCRA Moreover ordinary industrial wastes such as paint wastes waste solvents laboratory wastes and waste compressor oils may be regulated as hazardous waste The transportation of natural gas in pipelines may also generate some hazardous wastes that would be subject to RCRA or comparable state law requirements Liability for Remediation CERCLA also known as Superfund and comparable state laws impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons responsible for the release of hazardous substances into the environment Such classes of persons include the current and past owners or operators of sites where a hazardous substance was released and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances at offsite locations such as landfills Although petroleum as well as natural gas is excluded from CERCLAs definition of a hazardous substance in the course of our ordinary operations we generate wastes that may fall within the definition of a hazardous substance CERCLA authorizes the EPA and in some cases third parties to take action in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur Under CERCLA we could be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up and restoring sites where hazardous substances have been released for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies Liability for Preexisting Conditions For information about preexisting environmental matters please see Note 15d 13 EMPLOYEES As of December 31 2016  we had 7727

operations through subsidiaries primarily Houston Electric and CERC We also own interests in Enable The following along with any additional legal proceedings identified or incorporated by reference in Item 3 of this report summarizes the principal risk factors associated with the businesses conducted by our subsidiaries and our interests in Enable Risk Factors Associated with Our Consolidated Financial Condition As a holding company with no operations of our own we will depend on distributions from our subsidiaries and from Enable to meet our payment obligations and to pay dividends on our common stock and provisions of applicable law or contractual restrictions could limit the amount of those distributions We derive all of our operating income from and hold all of our assets through our subsidiaries including our interests in Enable As a result we depend on distributions from our subsidiaries and Enable to meet our payment obligations and to pay dividends on our common stock In general our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to provide us with funds for our payment obligations whether by dividends distributions loans or otherwise In addition provisions of applicable law such as those limiting the legal sources of dividends limit our subsidiaries ability to make payments or other distributions to us and our subsidiaries could agree to contractual restrictions on their ability to make distributions For a discussion 15 of risks that may impact the amount of cash distributions we receive with respect to our interests in Enable please read   Additional Risk Factors Affecting Our Interests in Enable Midstream Partners LP  Our cash flows will be adversely impacted if we receive less cash distributions from Enable than we currently expect Our right to receive any assets of any subsidiary and therefore the right of our creditors to participate in those assets will be effectively subordinated to the claims of that subsidiarys creditors including trade creditors In addition even if we were a creditor of any subsidiary our rights as a creditor would be subordinated to any security interest in the assets of that subsidiary and any indebtedness of the subsidiary senior to that held by us If we are unable to arrange future financings on acceptable terms our ability to refinance existing indebtedness could be limited Our businesses are capital intensive in nature We depend on longterm debt to finance a portion of our capital expenditures and refinance our existing debt and on shortterm borrowings through our revolving credit facilities and commercial paper programs to satisfy liquidity needs to the extent not satisfied by cash flow from our business operations As of December 31 2016 we had 86 billion of outstanding indebtedness on a consolidated basis which includes 23 billion of nonrecourse Securitization Bonds As of December 31 2016 approximately 850 million principal amount of this debt is required to be paid through 2019 This amount excludes principal repayments of approximately 13 billion on Securitization Bonds for which dedicated revenue streams exist Our future financing activities may be significantly affected by among other things  general economic and capital market conditions  credit availability from financial institutions and other lenders  volatility or fluctuations in distributions from Enables units or volatility in Enables unit price  investor confidence in us and the markets in which we operate  maintenance of acceptable credit ratings  market expectations regarding our future earnings and cash flows  our ability to access capital markets on reasonable terms  our exposure to GenOn formerly known as RRI Energy Inc Reliant Energy and RRI a whollyowned subsidiary of NRG in connection with certain indemnification obligations  incremental collateral that may be required due to regulation of derivatives and  provisions of relevant tax and securities laws As of December 31 2016 Houston Electric had approximately 26 billion aggregate principal amount of general mortgage bonds outstanding under the General Mortgage including approximately 118 million held in trust to secure pollution control bonds for which we are obligated Additionally as of December 31 2016 Houston Electric had approximately 102 million aggregate principal amount of first mortgage bonds outstanding under the Mortgage Houston Electric may issue additional general mortgage bonds on the basis of retired bonds 70 of property additions or cash deposited with the trustee Approximately 41 billion of additional first mortgage bonds and general mortgage bonds in the aggregate could be issued on the basis of retired bonds and 70 of property additions as of December 31 2016 However Houston Electric has contractually agreed that it will not issue additional first mortgage bonds subject to certain exceptions Our current credit ratings are discussed in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Other Matters  Impact on Liquidity of a Downgrade in Credit Ratings in Item 7 of Part II of this report These credit ratings may not remain in effect for any given period of time and one or more of these ratings may be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency We note that these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our securities Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating Any future reduction or withdrawal of one or more of our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our ability to access capital on acceptable terms 16 An impairment of goodwill longlived assets including intangible assets and equity and cost method investments could reduce our earnings Goodwill is recorded when the purchase price of a business exceeds the fair market value of the tangible and separately measurable intangible net assets Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require us to test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or when events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill might be impaired Longlived assets including intangible assets with finite useful lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable For investments we account for under the equity or cost method the impairment test considers whether the fair value of such investment as a whole not the underlying net assets has declined and whether that decline is other than temporary For example during the year ended December 31 2015 we determined that an other than temporary decrease in the value of our equity investment in Enable had occurred This determination was based on the sustained low Enable common unit price and further declines in such price during the year as well as the market outlook for continued depressed crude oil and natural gas prices impacting the midstream oil and gas industry We wrote down the value of our investment in Enable to its estimated fair value which resulted in impairment charges of 1225 million for the year ended December 31 2015 Additionally we recorded our share 621 million of impairment charges Enable recorded for goodwill and longlived assets for a total impairment charge of 1846 million If Enables unit price distributions or earnings were to decline to levels below those used in our impairment tests in 2015 and that decline is deemed to be other than temporary we could determine that we are unable to recover the carrying value of our equity investment in Enable Considerable judgment is used in determining if an impairment loss is other than temporary and the amount of any impairment A sustained low Enable common unit price could result in our recording further impairment charges in the future If we determine that an impairment is indicated we would be required to take an immediate noncash charge to earnings with a correlative effect on equity and balance sheet leverage as measured by debt to total capitalization Poor investment performance of the pension plan factors adversely affecting the calculation of pension liabilities and increasing health care costs could unfavorably impact our results of operations liquidity and financial position We maintain a qualified defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees Our costs of providing this plan are dependent upon a number of factors including the investment returns on plan assets the level of interest rates used to calculate the funded status of the plan our contributions to the plan and government regulations with respect to funding requirements and the calculation of plan liabilities Funding requirements may increase and we may be required to make unplanned contributions in the event of a decline in the market value of plan assets a decline in the interest rates used to calculate the present value of future plan obligations or government regulations that increase minimum funding requirements or the pension liability In addition to affecting our funding requirements each of these factors could adversely affect our results of operations liquidity and financial position Further increasing health care costs and the effects of health care reform or any future legislative changes could also materially affect our benefit programs and costs Our costs of providing employee benefits and related funding requirements could also increase materially in the future should there be a material reduction in the amount of the recovery of these costs through our rates or should significant delays develop in the timing of the recovery of such costs which could adversely affect our financial results The use of derivative contracts in the normal course of business by us our subsidiaries or Enable could result in financial losses that could negatively impact our results of operations and those of our subsidiaries or Enable We and our subsidiaries use derivative instruments such as swaps options futures and forwards to manage our commodity weather and financial market risks Enable may also use such instruments from time to time to manage its commodity and financial market risk We our subsidiaries or Enable could recognize financial losses as a result of volatility in the market values or ineffectiveness of these contracts or should a counterparty fail to perform In the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources the valuation of these financial instruments can involve managements judgment or use of estimates As a result changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these contracts Risk Factors Affecting Our Electric Transmission  Distribution Business Rate regulation of Houston Electrics business may delay or deny Houston Electrics ability to earn a reasonable return and fully recover its costs Houston Electrics rates are regulated by certain municipalities and the PUCT based on an analysis of its invested capital its expenses and other factors in a test year in comprehensive base rate proceedings subject to periodic review and adjustment using 17 mechanisms like those discussed below Each of these rate proceedings is subject to thirdparty intervention and appeal and the timing of a general base rate proceeding may be out of Houston Electrics control The rates that Houston Electric is allowed to charge may not match its costs at any given time which is referred to as regulatory lag Though several interim adjustment mechanisms have been implemented to reduce the effects of regulatory lag such adjustment mechanisms are subject to the applicable regulatory bodys approval and are subject to limitations that may reduce Houston Electrics ability to adjust rates For example the DCRF mechanism adjusts an electric utilitys rates for increases in net distributioninvested capital eg distribution plant and intangible plant and communication equipment since its last comprehensive base rate proceeding but Houston Electric may make a DCRF filing only once per year and up to four times between comprehensive rate proceedings The TCOS mechanism allows a transmission service provider to update its wholesale transmission rates to reflect changes in transmissionrelated invested capital but is only available twice a year Houston Electric can make no assurance that filings for such mechanisms will result in favorable adjustments to rates Further the regulatory process by which rates are determined is subject to change as a result of the legislative process or rulemaking as the case may be and may not always be available or result in rates that will produce recovery of Houston Electrics costs or enable Houston Electric to earn a reasonable return In addition changes to the interim adjustment mechanisms could result in an increase in regulatory lag or otherwise impact Houston Electrics ability to recover its costs in a timely manner To the extent the regulatory process does not allow Houston Electric to make a full and timely recovery of appropriate costs its results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected Disruptions at power generation facilities owned by third parties could interrupt Houston Electrics sales of transmission and distribution services Houston Electric transmits and distributes to customers of REPs electric power that the REPs obtain from power generation facilities owned by third parties Houston Electric does not own or operate any power generation facilities If power generation is disrupted or if power generation capacity is inadequate Houston Electrics sales of transmission and distribution services may be diminished or interrupted and its results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected Houston Electrics revenues and results of operations are seasonal A significant portion of Houston Electrics revenues is derived from rates that it collects from each REP based on the amount of electricity it delivers on behalf of such REP Thus Houston Electrics revenues and results of operations are subject to seasonality weather conditions and other changes in electricity usage with revenues generally being higher during the warmer months Unusually mild weather in the warmer months could diminish our results of operations and harm our financial condition Conversely extreme warm weather conditions could increase our results of operations in a manner that would not likely be annually recurring The AMS deployed throughout Houston Electrics service territory may experience unexpected problems with respect to the timely receipt of accurate metering data Houston Electric has deployed an AMS throughout its service territory The deployment consisted among other elements of replacing existing meters with new electronic meters that record metering data at 15minute intervals and wirelessly communicate that information to Houston Electric over a bidirectional communications system installed for that purpose The AMS integrates equipment and computer software from various vendors to eliminate the need for physical meter readings to be taken at consumers premises such as monthly readings for billing purposes and special readings associated with a customers change in REPs or the connection or disconnection of electric service Unanticipated difficulties could be encountered during the operation of the AMS including failures or inadequacy of equipment or software difficulties in integrating the various components of the AMS changes in technology cybersecurity issues and factors outside the control of Houston Electric which could result in delayed or inaccurate metering data that might lead to delays or inaccuracies in the calculation and imposition of delivery or other charges which could have a material adverse effect on Houston Electrics results of operations financial condition and cash flows Houston Electric could be subject to higher costs and fines or other sanctions as a result of mandatory reliability standards The FERC has jurisdiction with respect to ensuring the reliability of electric transmission service including transmission facilities owned by Houston Electric and other utilities within ERCOT The FERC has designated the NERC as the ERO to promulgate standards under FERC oversight for all owners operators and users of the bulk power system The FERC has approved the delegation by the NERC of authority for reliability in ERCOT to the TRE a functionally independent division of ERCOT Compliance with the mandatory reliability standards may subject Houston Electric to higher operating costs and may result in increased capital expenditures In addition if Houston Electric were to be found to be in noncompliance with applicable mandatory reliability standards it could be subject to sanctions including substantial monetary penalties 18 A substantial portion of Houston Electrics receivables is concentrated in a small number of REPs and any delay or default in payment could adversely affect Houston Electrics cash flows financial condition and results of operations Houston Electrics receivables from the distribution of electricity are collected from REPs that supply the electricity Houston Electric distributes to their customers As of December 31 2016 Houston Electric did business with approximately 64 REPs Adverse economic conditions structural problems in the market served by ERCOT or financial difficulties of one or more REPs could impair the ability of these REPs to pay for Houston Electrics services or could cause them to delay such payments Houston Electric depends on these REPs to remit payments on a timely basis Applicable regulatory provisions require that customers be shifted to another REP or a provider of last resort if a REP cannot make timely payments Applicable PUCT regulations significantly limit the extent to which Houston Electric can apply normal commercial terms or otherwise seek credit protection from firms desiring to provide retail electric service in its service territory and Houston Electric thus remains at risk for payments related to services provided prior to the shift to another REP or the provider of last resort The PUCT revised its regulations in 2009 to i increase the financial qualifications required of REPs that began selling power after January 1 2009 and ii authorize utilities to defer bad debts resulting from defaults by REPs for recovery in a future rate case A significant portion of Houston Electrics billed receivables from REPs are from affiliates of NRG and Energy Future Holdings Houston Electrics aggregate billed receivables balance from REPs as of December 31 2016 was 193 million Approximately 33 and 12 of this amount was owed by affiliates of NRG and Energy Future Holdings respectively In April 2014 Energy Future Holdings publicly disclosed that it and the substantial majority of its direct and indirect subsidiaries excluding Oncor Electric Delivery Company LLC and its subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware Any delay or default in payment by REPs could adversely affect Houston Electrics cash flows financial condition and results of operations If a REP were unable to meet its obligations it could consider among various options restructuring under the bankruptcy laws in which event such REP might seek to avoid honoring its obligations and claims might be made by creditors involving payments Houston Electric had received from such REP Risk Factors Affecting Our Natural Gas Distribution and Energy Services Businesses Rate regulation of CERCs business may delay or deny CERCs ability to earn a reasonable return and fully recover its costs CERCs rates for NGD are regulated by certain municipalities in Texas only and state commissions in the context of comprehensive base rate proceedings ie general rate cases based on an analysis of NGDs invested capital expenses and other factors in a test year often either fully or partially historic subject to periodic review and adjustment A general rate case is also a very complex and resource intensive proceeding with a relatively long timeline for completion Thus the rates that CERC is allowed to charge may not match its costs at any given time resulting in what is referred to as regulatory lag Though several interim rate adjustment mechanisms have been approved by jurisdictional regulatory authorities and implemented by NGD to reduce the effects of regulatory lag such adjustment mechanisms are subject to the applicable regulatory bodys approval and are subject to certain limitations that may reduce NGDs ability to adjust its rates Arkansas enacted legislation in 2015 allowing public utilities to elect to have their rates regulated pursuant to a FRP but such legislation provides for a utilitys base rates to be adjusted once a year In each of Louisiana Mississippi and Oklahoma NGD makes annual filings utilizing various formula rate mechanisms that adjust rates based on a comparison of authorized return to actual return to achieve the allowed return rates in those jurisdictions Additionally in Minnesota the MPUC implemented a full revenue decoupling pilot program in 2015 which separates approved revenues from the amount of natural gas used by its customers The effectiveness of these filings and programs depends on the approval of the applicable state regulatory body In Texas NGDs Houston South Texas BeaumontEast Texas and Texas Coast divisions each submit annual GRIP filings to recover the incremental capital investments made in the preceding year NGD must file a general rate case no later than five years after the initial GRIP implementation date NGD can make no assurances that such filings will result in favorable adjustments to its rates Notwithstanding the application of the rate mechanisms discussed above the regulatory process in which rates are determined may not always result in rates that will produce full recovery of NGDs costs and enable NGD to earn a reasonable return on its invested capital Additionally inherent in the regulatory process is some level of risk that jurisdictional regulatory authorities may initiate investigations of the prudence of operating expenses incurred or capital investments made by NGD and deny the full recovery of NGDs cost of service or the full recovery of incurred natural gas costs in rates To the extent the regulatory process does not allow NGD to make a full and timely recovery of appropriate costs its results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 19 CERCs natural gas distribution and energy services businesses including transportation and storage are subject to fluctuations in notional natural gas prices as well as geographic and seasonal natural gas price differentials which could affect the ability of CERCs suppliers and customers to meet their obligations or otherwise adversely affect CERCs liquidity and results of operations and financial condition CERC is subject to risk associated with changes in the notional price of natural gas as well as geographic and seasonal natural gas price differentials Increases in natural gas prices might affect CERCs ability to collect balances due from its customers and for NGD could create the potential for uncollectible accounts expense to exceed the recoverable levels built into CERCs tariff rates In addition a sustained period of high natural gas prices could i decrease demand for natural gas in the areas in which CERC operates thereby resulting in decreased sales and revenues and ii increase the risk that CERCs suppliers or customers fail or are unable to meet their obligations An increase in natural gas prices would also increase CERCs working capital requirements by increasing the investment that must be made in order to maintain natural gas inventory levels Additionally a decrease in natural gas prices could increase the amount of collateral that CERC must provide under its hedging arrangements A decline in CERCs credit rating could result in CERC having to provide collateral under its shipping or hedging arrangements or to purchase natural gas If CERCs credit rating were to decline it might be required to post cash collateral under its shipping or hedging arrangements or to purchase natural gas If a credit rating downgrade and the resultant cash collateral requirement were to occur at a time when CERC was experiencing significant working capital requirements or otherwise lacked liquidity CERCs results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected CERCs revenues and results of operations are seasonal A substantial portion of CERCs revenues is derived from natural gas sales Thus CERCs revenues and results of operations are subject to seasonality weather conditions and other changes in natural gas usage with revenues being higher during the winter months Unusually mild weather in the winter months could diminish our results of operations and harm our financial condition Conversely extreme cold weather conditions could increase our results of operations in a manner that would not likely be annually recurring The states in which CERC provides regulated local natural gas distribution may either through legislation or rules adopt restrictions regarding organization financing and affiliate transactions that could have significant adverse impacts on CERCs ability to operate From time to time proposals have been put forth in some of the states in which CERC does business to give state regulatory authorities increased jurisdiction and scrutiny over organization capital structure intracompany relationships and lines of business that could be pursued by registered holding companies and their affiliates that operate in those states Some of these frameworks attempt to regulate financing activities acquisitions and divestitures and arrangements between the utilities and their affiliates and to restrict the level of nonutility business that can be conducted within the holding company structure Additionally they may impose recordkeeping record access employee training and reporting requirements related to affiliate transactions and reporting in the event of certain downgrading of the utilitys credit rating These regulatory frameworks could have adverse effects on CERCs ability to conduct its utility operations to finance its business and to provide costeffective utility service In addition if more than one state adopts restrictions on similar activities it may be difficult for CERC and us to comply with competing regulatory requirements CERCs businesses must compete with alternate energy sources which could result in CERC marketing less natural gas which could have an adverse impact on CERCs results of operations financial condition and cash flows CERC competes primarily with alternate energy sources such as electricity and other fuel sources In some areas intrastate pipelines other natural gas distributors and marketers also compete directly with CERC for natural gas sales to end users In addition as a result of federal regulatory changes affecting interstate pipelines natural gas marketers operating on these pipelines may be able to bypass CERCs facilities and market sell andor transport natural gas directly to commercial and industrial customers Any reduction in the amount of natural gas marketed sold or transported by CERC as a result of competition may have an adverse impact on CERCs results of operations financial condition and cash flows 20 Risk Factors Affecting Our Interests in Enable Midstream Partners LP We hold a substantial limited partnership interest in Enable 541 of Enables outstanding limited partnership interests as of December 31 2016 as well as 50 of the management rights in Enables general partner and a 40 interest in the incentive distribution rights held by Enables general partner As of December 31 2016 we owned an aggregate of 14520000 Series A Preferred Units in Enable Accordingly our future earnings results of operations cash flows and financial condition will be affected by the performance of Enable the amount of cash distributions we receive from Enable and the value of our interests in Enable Factors that may have a material impact on Enables performance and cash distributions and hence the value of our interests in Enable include the risk factors outlined below as well as the risks described elsewhere under Risk Factors that are applicable to Enable Our cash flows will be adversely impacted if we receive less cash distributions from Enable than we currently expect Both CERC Corp and OGE hold their limited partnership interests in Enable in the form of both common units and subordinated units We also hold Series A Preferred Units in Enable For its Series A Preferred Units Enable is expected to pay 0625 per Series A Preferred Unit or 250 per Series A Preferred Unit on an annualized basis However distributions on each Series A Preferred Unit are not mandatory and are noncumulative in the event distributions are not declared on the Series A Preferred Units Enable is expected to pay a minimum quarterly distribution of 02875 per unit or 115 per unit on an annualized basis on its outstanding common and subordinated units to the extent it has sufficient cash from operations after establishment of cash reserves and payment of fees and expenses including payments to its general partner and its affiliates referred to as available cash The principal difference between Enables common units and subordinated units is that in any quarter during the applicable subordination period holders of the subordinated units are not entitled to receive any distribution of available cash until the common units have received the minimum quarterly distribution plus any arrearages in the payment of the minimum quarterly distribution on common units from prior quarters If Enable does not pay distributions on its subordinated units its subordinated units will not accrue arrearages for those unpaid distributions Accordingly if Enable is unable to pay its minimum quarterly distribution the amount of cash distributions we receive from Enable may be adversely affected Enable may not have sufficient available cash each quarter to enable it to pay the minimum quarterly distribution or to pay distributions on the Series A Preferred Units Additionally distributions on the Series A Preferred Units reduce the amount of available cash Enable has to pay distributions on its common and subordinated units The amount of cash Enable can distribute on its common and subordinated units and its Series A Preferred Units will principally depend upon the amount of cash it generates from its operations which will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on among other things  the fees and gross margins it realizes with respect to the volume of natural gas NGLs and crude oil that it handles  the prices of levels of production of and demand for natural gas NGLs and crude oil  the volume of natural gas NGLs and crude oil it gathers compresses treats dehydrates processes fractionates transports and stores  the relationship among prices for natural gas NGLs and crude oil  cash calls and settlements of hedging positions  margin requirements on open price risk management assets and liabilities  the level of competition from other midstream energy companies  adverse effects of governmental and environmental regulation  the level of its operation and maintenance expenses and general and administrative costs and  prevailing economic conditions In addition the actual amount of cash Enable will have available for distribution will depend on other factors including  the level and timing of its capital expenditures  the cost of acquisitions 21  its debt service requirements and other liabilities  fluctuations in its working capital needs  its ability to borrow funds and access capital markets  restrictions contained in its debt agreements  the amount of cash reserves established by its general partner  distributions paid on its Series A Preferred Units and  other business risks affecting its cash levels The amount of cash Enable has available for distribution to us on its common and subordinated units and Series A Preferred Units depends primarily on its cash flow rather than on its profitability which may prevent Enable from making distributions even during periods in which Enable records net income The amount of cash Enable has available for distribution on its common and subordinated units and Series A Preferred Units depends primarily upon its cash flows and not solely on profitability which will be affected by noncash items As a result Enable may make cash distributions during periods when it records losses for financial accounting purposes and may not make cash distributions during periods when it records net earnings for financial accounting purposes Enables Series A Preferred Units are required to be redeemed in certain circumstances if they are not eligible for trading on the NYSE and Enable may not have sufficient funds to redeem its Series A Preferred Units if required to do so As a holder of Enables Series A Preferred Units we may request that Enable list those units for trading on the NYSE If Enable is unable to list the Series A Preferred Units in certain circumstances it will be required to redeem the Series A Preferred Units There can be no assurance that Enable would have sufficient financial resources available to satisfy its obligation to redeem the Series A Preferred Units In addition mandatory redemption of the Series A Preferred Units could have a material adverse effect on Enables business financial position results of operations and ability to make quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders We are not able to exercise control over Enable which entails certain risks Enable is controlled jointly by CERC Corp and OGE who each own 50 of the management rights in the general partner of Enable The board of directors of Enables general partner is composed of an equal number of directors appointed by OGE and by us the president and chief executive officer of Enables general partner and three directors who are independent as defined under the independence standards established by the NYSE Accordingly we are not able to exercise control over Enable  Although we jointly control Enable with OGE we may have conflicts of interest with Enable that could subject us to claims that we have breached our fiduciary duty to Enable and its unitholders CERC Corp and OGE each own 50 of the management rights in Enables general partner as well as limited partnership interests in Enable and interests in the incentive distribution rights held by Enables general partner We also hold Series A Preferred Units in Enable Conflicts of interest may arise between us and Enable and its unitholders Our joint control of the general partner of Enable may increase the possibility of claims of breach of fiduciary duties including claims of conflicts of interest related to Enable In resolving these conflicts we may favor our own interests and the interests of our affiliates over the interests of Enable and its unitholders as long as the resolution does not conflict with Enables partnership agreement These circumstances could subject us to claims that in favoring our own interests and those of our affiliates we breached a fiduciary duty to Enable or its unitholders Enables contracts are subject to renewal risks As contracts with its existing suppliers and customers expire Enable may have to negotiate extensions or renewals of those contracts or enter into new contracts with other suppliers and customers Enable may be unable to extend or renew existing contracts or enter into new contracts on favorable commercial terms if at all Depending on prevailing market conditions at the time of an extension or renewal gathering and processing customers with fee based contracts may desire to enter into contracts under different fee arrangements Approximately 87 of Enables gross margin was generated from feebased contracts during the year ended December 31 2016 Likewise Enables transportation and storage customers may choose not to extend or renew expiring contracts 22 based on the economics of the related areas of production To the extent Enable is unable to renew or replace its expiring contracts on terms that are favorable if at all or successfully manage its overall contract mix over time its financial position results of operations and ability to make cash distributions could be adversely affected Enable depends on a small number of customers for a significant portion of its gathering and processing services revenues and its transportation and storage services revenues The loss of or reduction in volumes from these customers could result in a decline in sales of its gathering and processing or transportation and storage services and adversely affect its financial position results of operations and ability to make cash distributions For the year ended December 31 2016 49 of Enables gathered natural gas volumes were attributable to the affiliates of Continental Vine GeoSouthern XTO Energy and Apache and 51 of its transportation and storage service revenues were attributable to affiliates of CenterPoint Energy Spire XTO Energy American Electric Power Company and OGE The loss of all or even a portion of the gathering and processing or transportation and storage services for any of these customers the failure to extend or replace these contracts or the extension or replacement of these contracts on less favorable terms as a result of competition or otherwise could adversely affect Enables financial position results of operations and ability to make cash distributions Enables businesses are dependent in part on the drilling and production decisions of others Enables businesses are dependent on the drilling and production of natural gas and crude oil Enable has no control over the level of drilling activity in its areas of operation or the amount of natural gas NGL or crude oil reserves associated with wells connected to its systems In addition as the rate at which production from wells currently connected to its systems naturally declines over time Enables gross margin associated with those wells will also decline To maintain or increase throughput levels on its gathering and transportation systems and the asset utilization rates at its natural gas processing plants Enables customers must continually obtain new natural gas NGL and crude oil supplies The primary factors affecting Enables ability to obtain new supplies of natural gas NGLs and crude oil and attract new customers to its assets are the level of successful drilling activity near its systems its ability to compete for volumes from successful new wells and its ability to expand its capacity as needed If Enable is not able to obtain new supplies of natural gas NGLs and crude oil to replace the natural decline in volumes from existing wells throughput on its gathering processing transportation and storage facilities will decline which could adversely affect its financial position results of operations and ability to make cash distributions Enable has no control over producers or their drilling and production decisions which are affected by among other things  the availability and cost of capital  prevailing and projected commodity prices including the prices of natural gas NGLs and crude oil  demand for natural gas NGLs and crude oil  levels of reserves  geological considerations  environmental or other governmental regulations including the availability of drilling permits and the regulation of hydraulic fracturing and  the availability of drilling rigs and other costs of production and equipment Fluctuations in energy prices can also greatly affect the development of new natural gas NGL and crude oil reserves Drilling and production activity generally decreases as commodity prices decrease In general terms the prices of natural gas NGLs crude oil and other hydrocarbon products fluctuate in response to changes in supply and demand market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond Enables control Because of these factors even if new natural gas NGL or crude oil reserves are known to exist in areas served by Enables assets producers may choose not to develop those reserves Declines in natural gas NGL or crude oil prices can have a negative impact on exploration development and production activity and if sustained could lead to decreases in such activity In early 2016 natural gas and crude oil prices dropped to their lowest levels in over 10 years Both natural gas and crude oil prices increased moderately in the second half of 2016 Sustained low natural gas NGL or crude oil prices could also lead producers to shut in production from their existing wells Sustained reductions in exploration or production activity in Enables areas of operation could lead to further reductions in the utilization of its systems which could adversely affect Enables financial position results of operations and ability to make cash distributions 23 In addition it may be more difficult to maintain or increase the current volumes on Enables gathering systems and processing plants as several of the formations in the unconventional resource plays in which it operates generally have higher initial production rates and steeper production decline curves than wells in more conventional basins Should Enable determine that the economics of its gathering assets do not justify the capital expenditures needed to grow or maintain volumes associated therewith Enable may reduce such capital expenditures which could cause revenues associated with these assets to decline over time In addition to capital expenditures to support growth the steeper production decline curves associated with unconventional resource plays may require Enable to incur higher maintenance capital expenditures relative to throughput over time which will reduce its distributable cash flow Because of these and other factors even if new reserves are known to exist in areas served by Enables assets producers may choose not to develop those reserves Reductions in drilling activity would result in Enables inability to maintain the current levels of throughput on its systems and could adversely affect its financial position results of operations and ability to make cash distributions Enables industry is highly competitive and increased competitive pressure could adversely affect its financial position results of operations and ability to make cash distributions Enable competes with similar enterprises in its respective areas of operation The principal elements of competition are rates terms of service and flexibility and reliability of service Enables competitors include large energy companies that have greater financial resources and access to supplies of natural gas NGLs and crude oil than Enable Some of these competitors may expand or construct gathering processing transportation and storage systems that would create additional competition for the services Enable provides to its customers Excess pipeline capacity in the regions served by Enables interstate pipelines could also increase competition and adversely impact Enables ability to renew or enter into new contracts with respect to its available capacity when existing contracts expire In addition Enables customers that are significant producers of natural gas or crude oil may develop their own gathering processing transportation and storage systems in lieu of using Enables systems Enables ability to renew or replace existing contracts with its customers at rates sufficient to maintain current revenues and cash flows could be adversely affected by the activities of its competitors and customers Further natural gas utilized as a fuel competes with other forms of energy available to end users including electricity coal and liquid fuels Increased demand for such forms of energy at the expense of natural gas could lead to a reduction in demand for natural gas gathering processing transportation and storage services All of these competitive pressures could adversely affect Enables financial position results of operations and ability to make cash distributions Enable may not be able to recover the costs of its substantial planned investment in capital improvements and additions and the actual cost of such improvements and additions may be significantly higher than it anticipates Enables business plan calls for investment in capital improvements and additions In Enables Form 10K for the year ended December 31 2016 Enable stated that it expects that its expansion capital could range from approximately 455 million to 575 million and its maintenance capital could range from approximately 95 million to 125 million for the year ending December 31 2017 In the second quarter of 2016 Enable delayed the completion of the Wildhorse Plant a cryogenic processing facility that it plans to connect to its superheader system in Garvin County Oklahoma Enable also plans to construct natural gas gathering and compression infrastructure to support producer activity The construction of additions or modifications to Enables existing systems and the construction of new midstream assets involves numerous regulatory environmental political and legal uncertainties many of which are beyond Enables control and may require the expenditure of significant amounts of capital which may exceed its estimates These projects may not be completed at the planned cost on schedule or at all The construction of new pipeline gathering treating processing compression or other facilities is subject to construction cost overruns due to labor costs costs of equipment and materials such as steel labor shortages or weather or other delays inflation or other factors which could be material In addition the construction of these facilities is typically subject to the receipt of approvals and permits from various regulatory agencies Those agencies may not approve the projects in a timely manner if at all or may impose restrictions or conditions on the projects that could potentially prevent a project from proceeding lengthen its expected completion schedule andor increase its anticipated cost Moreover Enables revenues and cash flows may not increase immediately upon the expenditure of funds on a particular project For instance if Enable expands an existing pipeline or constructs a new pipeline the construction may occur over an extended period of time and Enable may not receive any material increases in revenues or cash flows until the project is completed In addition Enable may construct facilities to capture anticipated future growth in production in a region in which such growth does not materialize As a result the new facilities may not be able to achieve Enables expected investment return which could adversely affect its financial position results of operations and ability to make cash distributions 24 In connection with Enables capital investments Enable may estimate or engage a third party to estimate potential reserves in areas to be developed prior to constructing facilities in those areas To the extent Enable relies on estimates of future production in deciding to construct additions to its systems those estimates may prove to be inaccurate due to numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating future production As a result new facilities may not be able to attract sufficient throughput to achieve expected investment return which could adversely affect Enables financial position results of operations and ability to make cash distributions In addition the construction of additions to existing gathering and transportation assets may require new rightsofway prior to construction Those rightsofway to connect new natural gas supplies to existing gathering lines may be unavailable and Enable may not be able to capitalize on attractive expansion opportunities Additionally it may become more expensive to obtain new rightsofway or to renew existing rightsofway If the cost of renewing or obtaining new rightsofway increases Enables financial position results of operations and ability to make cash distributions could be adversely affected Natural gas NGL and crude oil prices are volatile and changes in these prices could adversely affect Enables financial position results of operations and ability to make cash distributions Enables financial position results of operations and ability to make cash distributions could be negatively affected by adverse movements in the prices of natural gas NGLs and crude oil depending on factors that are beyond Enables control These factors include demand for these commodities which fluctuates with changes in market and economic conditions and other factors including the impact of seasonality and weather general economic conditions the level of domestic and offshore natural gas production and consumption the availability of imported natural gas LNG NGLs and crude oil actions taken by foreign natural gas and oil producing nations the availability of local intrastate and interstate transportation systems the availability and marketing of competitive fuels the impact of energy conservation efforts technological advances affecting energy consumption and the extent of governmental regulation and taxation In early 2016 natural gas and crude oil prices dropped to their lowest levels in over 10 years Both natural gas and crude oil prices increased moderately in the second half of 2016 Enables natural gas processing arrangements expose it to commodity price fluctuations In 2016 8 46 and 46 of Enables processing plant inlet volumes consisted of keepwhole arrangements percentofproceeds or percentofliquids and feebased respectively Under a typical keepwhole arrangement Enable processes raw natural gas extracts the NGLs replaces the extracted NGLs with a Btu equivalent amount of natural gas delivers the processed and replacement natural gas to the producer retains the NGLs and sells the NGLs for its own account If Enable is unable to sell the NGLs extracted for more than the cost of the replacement natural gas the margins on its sale of goods will be negatively affected Under a typical percentofproceeds processing arrangement Enable purchases raw natural gas at a cost that is based on the amount of natural gas and NGLs contained in the raw natural gas Enable then processes the raw natural gas extracts the NGLs and sells the processed natural gas and NGLs for its own account If Enable is unable to sell the processed natural gas and NGLs for more than the cost of the raw natural gas the margins on its sale of goods will be negatively affected Under a typical percentofliquids processing arrangement and a typical feebased arrangement Enable purchases a portion of the raw natural gas that is equivalent to the amount of NGLs it contains processes the raw natural gas extracts the NGLs returns the processed natural gas to the producer and sells the NGLs for its own account If Enable is unable to sell the processed natural gas and NGLs for more than the cost of raw natural gas the margins on its sale of goods will be negatively affected At any given time Enables overall portfolio of processing contracts may reflect a net short position in natural gas meaning that Enable is a net buyer of natural gas and a net long position in NGLs meaning that Enable is a net seller of NGLs As a result Enables gross margin could be adversely impacted to the extent the price of NGLs decreases in relation to the price of natural gas Enable is exposed to credit risks of its customers and any material nonpayment or nonperformance by its key customers could adversely affect its financial position results of operations and ability to make cash distributions Some of Enables customers may experience financial problems that could have a significant effect on their creditworthiness Severe financial problems encountered by its customers could limit Enables ability to collect amounts owed to it or to enforce performance of obligations under contractual arrangements In addition many of Enables customers finance their activities through cash flow from operations the incurrence of debt or the issuance of equity The combination of reduction of cash flow resulting from declines in commodity prices a reduction in borrowing bases under reservebased credit facility and the lack of availability of debt or equity financing may result in a significant reduction of its customers liquidity and limit their ability to make payment or perform on their obligations to Enable Furthermore some of Enables customers may be highly leveraged and subject to their own operating and regulatory risks which increases the risk that they may default on their obligations to Enable Financial problems experienced by Enables customers could result in the impairment of its assets reduction of its operating cash flows and may also reduce or curtail their future use of its products and services which could reduce Enables revenues 25 Enable provides certain transportation and storage services under fixedprice negotiated rate contracts that are not subject to adjustment even if its cost to perform such services exceeds the revenues received from such contracts and as a result Enables costs could exceed its revenues received under such contracts Enable has been authorized by the FERC to provide transportation and storage services at its facilities at negotiated rates Generally negotiated rates are in excess of the maximum recourse rates allowed by the FERC but it is possible that costs to perform services under negotiated rate contracts will exceed the revenues obtained under these agreements If this occurs it could decrease the cash flow realized by Enables systems and therefore decrease the cash it has available for distribution As of December 31 2016 approximately 54 of Enables contracted firm transportation capacity and 44 of its contracted firm storage capacity was subscribed under such negotiated rate contracts These contracts generally do not include provisions allowing for adjustment for increased costs due to inflation pipeline safety activities or other factors that are not tied to an applicable tracking mechanism authorized by the FERC Successful recovery of any shortfall of revenue representing the difference between recourse rates if higher and negotiated rates is not assured under current FERC policies If thirdparty pipelines and other facilities interconnected to Enables gathering processing or transportation facilities become partially or fully unavailable for any reason Enables financial position results of operations and ability to make cash distributions could be adversely affected Enable depends upon thirdparty pipelines to deliver natural gas to and take natural gas from its natural gas transportation systems and upon thirdparty pipelines to take crude oil from its crude oil gathering systems Enable also depends on thirdparty facilities to transport and fractionate NGLs that are delivered to the third party at the tailgates of Enables processing plants Fractionation is the separation of the heterogeneous mixture of extracted NGLs into individual components for enduse sale For example an outage or disruption on certain pipelines or fractionators operated by a third party could result in the shutdown of certain of Enables processing plants and gathering systems and a prolonged outage or disruption could ultimately result in a reduction in the volume of natural gas Enable gathers and NGLs it is able to produce Additionally Enable depends on third parties to provide electricity for compression at many of its facilities Since Enable does not own or operate any of these thirdparty pipelines or other facilities their continuing operation is not within its control If any of these thirdparty pipelines or other facilities become partially or fully unavailable for any reason Enables financial position results of operations and ability to make cash distributions could be adversely affected Enable does not own all of the land on which its pipelines and facilities are located which could disrupt its operations Enable does not own all of the land on which its pipelines and facilities have been constructed and it is therefore subject to the possibility of more onerous terms andor increased costs to retain necessary land use if it does not have valid rightsofway or if such rightsofway lapse or terminate Enable may obtain the rights to construct and operate its pipelines on land owned by third parties and governmental agencies for a specific period of time A loss of these rights through Enables inability to renew rightofway contracts or otherwise could cause it to cease operations temporarily or permanently on the affected land increase costs related to the construction and continuing operations elsewhere and adversely affect its financial position results of operations and ability to make cash distributions Enable conducts a portion of its operations through joint ventures which subject it to additional risks that could adversely affect the success of these operations and Enables financial position results of operations and ability to make cash distributions Enable conducts a portion of its operations through joint ventures with third parties including Spectra Energy Partners LP DCP Midstream Partners LP Trans Louisiana Gas Pipeline Inc and Pablo Gathering LLC Enable may also enter into other joint venture arrangements in the future These third parties may have obligations that are important to the success of the joint venture such as the obligation to pay their share of capital and other costs of the joint venture The performance of these thirdparty obligations including the ability of the third parties to satisfy their obligations under these arrangements is outside Enables control If these parties do not satisfy their obligations under these arrangements Enables business may be adversely affected Enables joint venture arrangements may involve risks not otherwise present when operating assets directly including for example  Enables joint venture partners may share certain approval rights over major decisions  Enables joint venture partners may not pay their share of the joint ventures obligations leaving Enable liable for their shares of joint venture liabilities 26  Enable may be unable to control the amount of cash it will receive from the joint venture  Enable may incur liabilities as a result of an action taken by its joint venture partners  Enable may be required to devote significant management time to the requirements of and matters relating to the joint ventures  Enables insurance policies may not fully cover loss or damage incurred by both Enable and its joint venture partners in certain circumstances  Enables joint venture partners may be in a position to take actions contrary to its instructions or requests or contrary to its policies or objectives and  disputes between Enable and its joint venture partners may result in delays litigation or operational impasses The risks described above or the failure to continue Enables joint ventures or to resolve disagreements with its joint venture partners could adversely affect its ability to transact the business that is the subject of such joint venture which would in turn adversely affect Enables financial position results of operations and ability to make cash distributions The agreements under which Enable formed certain joint ventures may subject it to various risks limit the actions it may take with respect to the assets subject to the joint venture and require Enable to grant rights to its joint venture partners that could limit its ability to benefit fully from future positive developments Some joint ventures require Enable to make significant capital expenditures If Enable does not timely meet its financial commitments or otherwise does not comply with its joint venture agreements its rights to participate exercise operator rights or otherwise influence or benefit from the joint venture may be adversely affected Certain of Enables joint venture partners may have substantially greater financial resources than Enable has and Enable may not be able to secure the funding necessary to participate in operations its joint venture partners propose thereby reducing its ability to benefit from the joint venture Enables ability to grow is dependent on its ability to access external financing sources Enable expects that it will distribute all of its available cash to its unitholders As a result Enable is expected to rely primarily upon external financing sources including commercial bank borrowings and the issuance of debt and equity securities to fund acquisitions and expansion capital expenditures As a result to the extent Enable is unable to finance growth externally Enables cash distribution policy will significantly impair its ability to grow In addition because Enable is expected to distribute all of its available cash its growth may not be as fast as businesses that reinvest their available cash to expand ongoing operations To the extent Enable issues additional units in connection with any acquisitions or expansion capital expenditures the payment of distributions on those additional units may increase the risk that Enable will be unable to maintain or increase its per unit distribution level which in turn may impact the available cash that it has to distribute on each unit There are no limitations in Enables partnership agreement on its ability to issue additional units including units ranking senior to the common units The incurrence of additional commercial borrowings or other debt by Enable to finance its growth strategy would result in increased interest expense which in turn may negatively impact the available cash that Enable has to distribute to its unitholders Enable depends on access to the capital markets to fund its expansion capital expenditures Historically unit prices of midstream master limited partnerships have experienced periods of volatility In addition because Enables common units are yieldbased securities rising market interest rates could impact the relative attractiveness of its common units to investors As a result of capital market volatility Enable may be unable to issue equity or debt on satisfactory terms or at all which may limit its ability to expand its operations or make future acquisitions Enables debt levels may limit its flexibility in obtaining additional financing and in pursuing other business opportunities As of December 31 2016 Enable had approximately 30 billion of longterm debt outstanding excluding the premiums on their senior notes Enable has a 175 billion revolving credit facility for working capital capital expenditures and other partnership purposes including acquisitions of which 11 billion was available as of February 1 2017 Enable will continue to have the ability to incur additional debt subject to limitations in its credit facilities The levels of Enables debt could have important consequences including the following  the ability to obtain additional financing if necessary for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions or other purposes may be impaired or the financing may not be available on favorable terms if at all 27  a portion of cash flows will be required to make interest payments on the debt reducing the funds that would otherwise be available for operations future business opportunities and distributions  Enables debt level will make it more vulnerable to competitive pressures or a downturn in its business or the economy generally and  Enables debt level may limit its flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions Enables ability to service its debt will depend upon among other things its future financial and operating performance which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions commodity prices and financial business regulatory and other factors some of which are beyond Enables control If operating results are not sufficient to service current or future indebtedness Enable may be forced to take actions such as reducing distributions reducing or delaying business activities acquisitions investments or capital expenditures selling assets restructuring or refinancing debt or seeking additional equity capital These actions may not be effected on satisfactory terms or at all Enables credit facilities contain operating and financial restrictions including covenants and restrictions that may be affected by events beyond Enables control which could adversely affect its financial condition results of operations and ability to make distributions Enables credit facilities contain customary covenants that among other things limit its ability to  permit its subsidiaries to incur or guarantee additional debt  incur or permit to exist certain liens on assets  dispose of assets  merge or consolidate with another company or engage in a change of control  enter into transactions with affiliates on nonarms length terms and  change the nature of its business Enables credit facilities also require it to maintain certain financial ratios Enables ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond its control and we cannot assure you that it will meet those ratios In addition Enables credit facilities contain events of default customary for agreements of this nature Enables ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in its credit facilities may be affected by events beyond its control including prevailing economic financial and industry conditions If market or other economic conditions deteriorate Enables ability to comply with these covenants may be impaired If Enable violates any of the restrictions covenants ratios or tests in its credit facilities a significant portion of its indebtedness may become immediately due and payable In addition Enables lenders commitments to make further loans to it under the revolving credit facility may be suspended or terminated Enable might not have or be able to obtain sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments Enable may be unable to obtain or renew permits necessary for its operations which could inhibit its ability to do business Performance of Enables operations require that Enable obtains and maintains a number of federal and state permits licenses and approvals with terms and conditions containing a significant number of prescriptive limits and performance standards in order to operate All of these permits licenses approval limits and standards require a significant amount of monitoring record keeping and reporting in order to demonstrate compliance with the underlying permit license approval limit or standard Noncompliance or incomplete documentation of Enables compliance status may result in the imposition of fines penalties and injunctive relief A decision by a government agency to deny or delay the issuance of a new or existing material permit or other approval or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit or other approval could adversely affect Enables ability to initiate or continue operations at the affected location or facility and on its financial condition results of operations and ability to make cash distributions Additionally in order to obtain permits and renewals of permits and other approvals in the future Enable may be required to prepare and present data to governmental authorities pertaining to the potential adverse impact that any proposed pipeline or processingrelated activities may have on the environment individually or in the aggregate including on public and Indian lands 28 Certain approval procedures may require preparation of archaeological surveys endangered species studies and other studies to assess the environmental impact of new sites or the expansion of existing sites Compliance with these regulatory requirements is expensive and significantly lengthens the time required to prepare applications and to receive authorizations Costs of compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations are significant and the cost of compliance with future environmental laws and regulations may adversely affect Enables financial position results of operations and ability to make cash distributions Enable is subject to extensive federal state and local environmental statutes rules and regulations relating to air quality water quality waste management wildlife conservation natural resources and health and safety that could among other things delay or increase its costs of construction restrict or limit the output of certain facilities andor require additional pollution control equipment and otherwise increase costs For instance in May 2016 the EPA issued final New Source Performance Standards governing methane emissions imposing more stringent controls on methane and volatile organic compounds emissions at new and modified oil and natural gas production processing storage and transmission facilities These rules have required changes to Enables operations including the installation of new equipment to control emissions The EPA has also announced that it intends to impose methane emission standards for existing sources and has issued information collection requests to companies with production gathering and boosting gas processing storage and transmission facilities Additionally several states are pursuing similar measures to regulate emissions of methane from new and existing sources There are significant capital operating and other costs associated with compliance with these environmental statutes rules and regulations As a result of this continued regulatory focus future federal and state regulations relating to Enables gathering and processing transmission and storage operations remain a possibility and could result in increased compliance costs on its operations Furthermore if new or more stringent federal state or local legal restrictions are adopted in areas where Enables oil and natural gas exploration and production customers operate they could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration development or production activities and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells some or all of which could adversely affect demand for Enables services to those customers There is inherent risk of the incurrence of environmental costs and liabilities in Enables operations due to its handling of natural gas NGLs crude oil and produced water as well as air emissions related to its operations and historical industry operations and waste disposal practices These matters are subject to stringent and complex federal state and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection including the discharge of materials into the environment and the protection of plants wildlife and natural and cultural resources These laws and regulations can restrict or impact Enables business activities in many ways such as restricting the way it can handle or dispose of wastes or requiring remedial action to mitigate pollution conditions that may be caused by its operations or that are attributable to former operators Joint and several strict liability may be incurred without regard to fault under certain of these environmental laws and regulations in connection with discharges or releases of wastes on under or from Enables properties and facilities many of which have been used for midstream activities for a number of years oftentimes by third parties not under its control Private parties including the owners of the properties through which Enables gathering systems pass and facilities where its wastes are taken for reclamation or disposal may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage For example an accidental release from one of Enables pipelines could subject it to substantial liabilities arising from environmental cleanup and restoration costs claims made by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury and property damage and fines or penalties for related violations of environmental laws or regulations Enable may be unable to recover these costs from insurance Moreover the possibility exists that stricter laws regulations or enforcement policies could significantly increase compliance costs and the cost of any remediation that may become necessary Further stricter requirements could negatively impact Enables customers production and operations resulting in less demand for its services Increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing could result in reductions or delays in natural gas production by Enables customers which could adversely affect its financial position results of operations and ability to make cash distributions Hydraulic fracturing is common practice that is used by many of Enables customers to stimulate production of natural gas and crude oil from dense subsurface rock formations The hydraulic fracturing process involves the injection of water sand and chemicals under pressure into targeted subsurface formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production Hydraulic fracturing typically is regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions In addition certain federal agencies have proposed additional laws and regulations to more closely regulate the hydraulic fracturing process For example in May 2016 the EPA issued final new source performance standard requirements that impose more stringent controls on methane and volatile organic compounds emissions from oil and gas development and production operations including hydraulic fracturing and other well completion activity The EPA also released the final results of its comprehensive research study on the potential adverse impacts that hydraulic fracturing may have on drinking water resources in December 2016 The EPA concluded that hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking water resources under some circumstances including large volume spills and inadequate mechanical 29 integrity of wells The results of EPAs study could spur action towards federal legislation and regulation of hydraulic fracturing or similar production operations In past sessions Congress has considered but not passed legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the Safe Drinking Water Act and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process The EPA has issued the Safe Water Drinking Act permitting guidance for hydraulic fracturing operations involving the use of diesel fuel in fracturing fluids in those states where the EPA is the permitting authority Additionally the Bureau of Land Management issued final rules to regulate hydraulic fracturing on federal lands in March 2015 Although these rules were struck down by a federal court in Wyoming in June 2016 an appeal of the decision is still pending Some states have adopted and other states are considering adopting legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting public disclosure or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities Local government also may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular in some cases banning hydraulic fracturing entirely If new or more stringent federal state or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where Enables oil and natural gas exploration and production customers operate they could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration development or production activities and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells some or all of which activities could adversely affect demand for Enables services to those customers State and federal regulatory agencies recently have focused on a possible connection between the operation of injection wells used for oil and gas waste disposal and seismic activity Similar concerns have been raised that hydraulic fracturing may also contribute to seismic activity When caused by human activity such events are called induced seismicity In March 2016 the United States Geological Survey identified six states with the most significant hazards from induced seismicity including Oklahoma Kansas Texas Colorado New Mexico and Arkansas In light of these concerns some state regulatory agencies have modified their regulations or issued orders to address induced seismicity For example the OCC has implemented volume reduction plans and at times required shutins for disposal wells injecting wastewater from oil and gas operations into the Arbuckle formation The OCC also recently released well completion seismicity guidelines for operators in the South Central Oklahoma Oil Province and the Sooner Trend Anadarko Basin Canadian and Kingfisher Counties that call for hydraulic fracturing operations to be suspended following earthquakes of certain magnitudes in the vicinity Certain environmental and other groups have also suggested that additional federal state and local laws and regulations may be needed to more closely regulate the hydraulic fracturing process Enable cannot predict whether additional federal state or local laws or regulations applicable to hydraulic fracturing will be enacted in the future and if so what actions any such laws or regulations would require or prohibit Increased regulation and attention given to induced seismicity could lead to greater opposition to and litigation concerning oil and gas activities utilizing hydraulic fracturing or injection wells for waste disposal Additional legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays or increased operating costs for Enables customers which in turn could reduce the demand for Enables services Other governmental agencies including the DOE have evaluated or are evaluating various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing These ongoing or proposed studies depending on their degree of pursuit and any meaningful results obtained could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the Safe Drinking Water Act or other regulatory mechanisms Enables operations are subject to extensive regulation by federal state and local regulatory authorities Changes or additional regulatory measures adopted by such authorities could adversely affect Enables financial position results of operations and ability to make cash distributions The rates charged by several of Enables pipeline systems including for interstate gas transportation service provided by its intrastate pipelines are regulated by the FERC Enables pipeline operations that are not regulated by the FERC may be subject to state and local regulation applicable to intrastate natural and transportation services The relevant states in which Enable operates include North Dakota Oklahoma Arkansas Louisiana Texas Missouri Kansas Mississippi Tennessee and Illinois The FERC and state regulatory agencies also regulate other terms and conditions of the services Enable may offer If one of these regulatory agencies on its own initiative or due to challenges by third parties were to lower its tariff rates or deny any rate increase or other material changes to the types or terms and conditions of service Enable might propose or offer the profitability of Enables pipeline businesses could suffer If Enable were permitted to raise its tariff rates for a particular pipeline there might be significant delay between the time the tariff rate increase is approved and the time that the rate increase actually goes into effect which could also limit its profitability Furthermore competition from other pipeline systems may prevent Enable from raising its tariff rates even if regulatory agencies permit it to do so The regulatory agencies that regulate Enables systems periodically implement new rules regulations and terms and conditions of services subject to their jurisdiction New initiatives or orders may adversely affect the rates charged for Enables services or otherwise adversely affect its financial position results of operations and cash flows and ability to make cash distributions 30 A change in the jurisdictional characterization of some of Enables assets by federal state or local regulatory agencies or a change in policy by those agencies may result in increased regulation of its assets which may cause its revenues to decline and operating expenses to increase Enables natural gas gathering and intrastate transportation operations are generally exempt from the jurisdiction of the FERC under the NGA but FERC regulation may indirectly impact these businesses and the markets for products derived from these businesses The FERCs policies and practices across the range of its oil and natural gas regulatory activities including for example its policies on interstate open access transportation ratemaking capacity release and market center promotion may indirectly affect intrastate markets In recent years the FERC has pursued procompetitive policies in its regulation of interstate oil and natural gas pipelines However we cannot assure you that the FERC will continue to pursue this approach as it considers matters such as pipeline rates and rules and policies that may indirectly affect the intrastate natural gas transportation business Although the FERC has not made a formal determination with respect to all of Enables facilities it considers to be gathering facilities Enable believes that its natural gas gathering pipelines meet the traditional tests that the FERC has used to determine that a pipeline is a gathering pipeline and are therefore not subject to FERC jurisdiction The distinction between FERCregulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services however has been the subject of substantial litigation and the FERC determines whether facilities are gathering facilities on a casebycase basis so the classification and regulation of Enables gathering facilities is subject to change based on future determinations by the FERC the courts or Congress If the FERC were to consider the status of an individual facility and determine that the facility andor services provided by it are not exempt from FERC regulation under the NGA and that the facility provides interstate service the rates for and terms and conditions of services provided by such facility would be subject to regulation by the FERC under the NGA or the NGPA Such regulation could decrease revenue increase operating costs and depending upon the facility in question could adversely affect Enables financial condition results of operations and ability to make cash distributions In addition if any of Enables facilities were found to have provided services or otherwise operated in violation of the NGA or the NGPA this could result in the imposition of substantial civil penalties as well as a requirement to disgorge revenues collected for such services in excess of the maximum rates established by the FERC Natural gas gathering may receive greater regulatory scrutiny at the state level therefore Enables natural gas gathering operations could be adversely affected should they become subject to the application of state regulation of rates and services Enables gathering operations could also be subject to safety and operational regulations relating to the design construction testing operation replacement and maintenance of gathering facilities We cannot predict what effect if any such changes might have on Enables operations but Enable could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased costs depending on future legislative and regulatory changes Other Risk Factors Affecting Our Businesses or Our Interests in Enable Midstream Partners LP We are subject to operational and financial risks and liabilities arising from environmental laws and regulations Our operations and the operations of Enable are subject to stringent and complex laws and regulations pertaining to the environment As an owner or operator of natural gas pipelines distribution systems and storage electric transmission and distribution systems and the facilities that support these systems we must comply with these laws and regulations at the federal state and local levels These laws and regulations can restrict or impact our business activities in many ways such as  restricting the way we can handle or dispose of wastes  limiting or prohibiting construction activities in sensitive areas such as wetlands coastal regions or areas inhabited by endangered species  requiring remedial action to mitigate environmental conditions caused by our operations or attributable to former operations  enjoining the operations of facilities with permits issued pursuant to such environmental laws and regulations and  impacting the demand for our services by directly or indirectly affecting the use or price of natural gas To comply with these requirements we may need to spend substantial amounts and devote other resources from time to time to  construct or acquire new facilities and equipment  acquire permits for facility operations 31  modify or replace existing and proposed equipment and  clean or decommission waste management areas fuel storage facilities and other locations Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative civil and criminal enforcement measures including the assessment of monetary penalties the imposition of remedial actions and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations Certain environmental statutes impose strict joint and several liability for costs required to clean and restore sites where hazardous substances have been stored disposed or released Moreover it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other waste products into the environment The recent trend in environmental regulation has been to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may impact the environment and thus there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation and actual future expenditures may be greater than the amounts we currently anticipate Our insurance coverage may not be sufficient Insufficient insurance coverage and increased insurance costs could adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flows We currently have general liability and property insurance in place to cover certain of our facilities in amounts that we consider appropriate Such policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles and do not include business interruption coverage Insurance coverage may not be available in the future at current costs or on commercially reasonable terms and the insurance proceeds received for any loss of or any damage to any of our facilities may not be sufficient to restore the loss or damage without negative impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows In common with other companies in its line of business that serve coastal regions Houston Electric does not have insurance covering its transmission and distribution system other than substations because Houston Electric believes it to be cost prohibitive In the future Houston Electric may not be able to recover the costs incurred in restoring its transmission and distribution properties following hurricanes or other disasters through issuance of storm restoration bonds or a change in its regulated rates or otherwise or any such recovery may not be timely granted Therefore Houston Electric may not be able to restore any loss of or damage to any of its transmission and distribution properties without negative impact on its results of operations financial condition and cash flows Our operations and Enables operations are subject to all of the risks and hazards inherent in the gathering processing transportation and storage of natural gas and crude oil including  damage to pipelines and plants related equipment and surrounding properties caused by hurricanes tornadoes floods fires and other natural disasters acts of terrorism and actions by third parties  inadvertent damage from construction vehicles farm and utility equipment  leaks of natural gas NGLs crude oil and other hydrocarbons or losses of natural gas NGLs and crude oil as a result of the malfunction of equipment or facilities  ruptures fires and explosions and  other hazards that could also result in personal injury and loss of life pollution and suspension of operations Enable currently has general liability and property insurance in place to cover certain of its facilities in amounts that Enable considers appropriate Such policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles Enable is not fully insured against all risks inherent in its business These risks could result in substantial losses due to personal injury andor loss of life severe damage to and destruction of property plant and equipment and pollution or other environmental damage These risks may also result in curtailment or suspension of Enables operations A natural disaster or other hazard affecting the areas in which Enable operates could have a material adverse effect on Enables operations Enable does not have business interruption insurance coverage for all of its operations Insurance coverage may not be available in the future at current costs or on commercially reasonable terms and the insurance proceeds received for any loss of or any damage to any of Enables facilities may not be sufficient to restore the loss or damage without negative impact on its results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions 32 We Houston Electric and CERC could incur liabilities associated with businesses and assets that we have transferred to others Under some circumstances we Houston Electric and CERC could incur liabilities associated with assets and businesses we Houston Electric and CERC no longer own These assets and businesses were previously owned by Reliant Energy a predecessor of Houston Electric directly or through subsidiaries and include  merchant energy energy trading and REP businesses transferred to RRI or its subsidiaries in connection with the organization and capitalization of RRI prior to its initial public offering in 2001 and now owned by affiliates of NRG and  Texas electric generating facilities transferred to a subsidiary of Texas Genco in 2002 later sold to a third party and now owned by an affiliate of NRG In connection with the organization and capitalization of RRI now GenOn and Texas Genco now an affiliate of NRG those companies andor their subsidiaries assumed liabilities associated with various assets and businesses transferred to them and agreed to certain indemnity agreements of CenterPoint Energy entities Such indemnities have applied in cases such as the litigation arising out of sales of natural gas in California and other markets the last remaining case involving CenterPoint Energy is now on appeal following the district courts summary judgment in favor of CES a subsidiary of CERC Corp and various asbestos and other environmental matters that arise from time to time GenOn has publicly disclosed that it may be unable to continue as a going concern and is exploring various options including negotiations with creditors and lessors refinancing potential sale of assets as well as the possibility of filing for protection under Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code If any of the indemnifying entities were unable to meet their indemnity obligations or satisfy a liability that has been assumed or if claims in one or more of these lawsuits were successfully asserted against us we Houston Electric or CERC could incur liability and be responsible for satisfying the liability In connection with our sale of Texas Genco the separation agreement was amended to provide that Texas Genco would no longer be liable for and we would assume and agree to indemnify Texas Genco against liabilities that Texas Genco originally assumed in connection with its organization to the extent and only to the extent that such liabilities are covered by certain insurance policies held by us and in certain of the asbestos lawsuits we have agreed to continue to defend such claims to the extent they are covered by insurance maintained by us subject to reimbursement of the costs of such defense by an NRG affiliate Cyberattacks physical security breaches acts of terrorism or other disruptions could adversely impact our or Enables results of operations financial condition andor cash flows We and Enable are subject to cyber and physical security risks related to adversaries attacking information technology systems network infrastructure and facilities used to i manage operations and other business processes and ii protect sensitive information maintained in the normal course of business The operation of our electric transmission and distribution system is dependent on not only physical interconnection of our facilities but also on communications among the various components of our system Such reliance on information and communication between and among those components has increased since deployment of smart meters and the intelligent grid Similarly our and Enables business operations are interconnected with external networks and facilities The distribution of natural gas to our customers requires communications with Enables pipeline facilities and thirdparty systems The gathering processing and transportation of natural gas from Enables gathering processing and pipeline facilities and crude oil gathering pipeline systems also rely on communications among its facilities and with thirdparty systems that may be delivering natural gas or crude oil into or receiving natural gas or crude oil and other products from Enables facilities Disruption of those communications whether caused by physical disruption such as storms or other natural phenomena by failure of equipment or technology or by manmade events such as cyberattacks or acts of terrorism may disrupt our or Enables ability to conduct operations and control assets Cyberattacks and unauthorized access could also result in the loss of confidential proprietary or critical infrastructure data or security breaches of other information technology systems that could disrupt operations and critical business functions adversely affect reputation increase costs and subject us or Enable to possible legal claims and liability Neither we nor Enable is fully insured against all cybersecurity risks any of which could have a material adverse effect on either our or Enables results of operations financial condition and cash flows In addition our and Enables critical energy infrastructure may be targets of terrorist activities that could disrupt our respective business operations Any such disruptions could result in significant costs to repair damaged facilities and implement increased security measures which could have a material adverse effect on either our or Enables results of operations financial condition and cash flows 33 Failure to maintain the security of personally identifiable information could adversely affect us In connection with our business we collect and retain personally identifiable information of our customers shareholders and employees Our customers shareholders and employees expect that we will adequately protect their personal information and the United States regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding A significant theft loss or fraudulent use of customer shareholder employee or CenterPoint Energy data by cybercrime or otherwise could adversely impact our reputation and could result in significant costs fines and litigation Our results of operations financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully operate our facilities or perform certain corporate functions Our performance depends on the successful operation of our facilities Operating these facilities involves many risks including  operator error or failure of equipment or processes  operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements  labor disputes  information technology or financial system failures that impair our information technology infrastructure reporting systems or disrupt normal business operations  information technology failure that affects our ability to access customer information or causes us to lose confidential or proprietary data that materially and adversely affects our reputation or exposes us to legal claims and  catastrophic events such as fires earthquakes explosions leaks floods droughts hurricanes terrorism pandemic health events or other similar occurrences Such events may result in a decrease or elimination of revenue from our facilities an increase in the cost of operating our facilities or delays in cash collections any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition andor cash flows Our success depends upon our ability to attract effectively transition and retain key employees and identify and develop talent to succeed senior management We depend on our senior executive officers and other key personnel Our success depends on our ability to attract effectively transition and retain key personnel The inability to recruit and retain or effectively transition key personnel or the unexpected loss of key personnel may adversely affect our operations In addition because of the reliance on our management team our future success depends in part on our ability to identify and develop talent to succeed senior management The retention of key personnel and appropriate senior management succession planning will continue to be critically important to the successful implementation of our strategies Failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could adversely impact our results of operations Our business is dependent on our ability to recruit retain and motivate employees Certain circumstances such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements a mismatch of existing skillsets to future needs or the unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges such as a lack of resources loss of knowledge or a lengthy time period associated with skill development Our costs including costs to replace employees productivity costs and safety costs may rise Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate our business If we are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce our results of operations could be negatively affected Climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for our services or Enables services Regulatory agencies have from time to time considered adopting legislation including modification of existing laws and regulations to reduce GHGs and there continues to be a wideranging policy and regulatory debate both nationally and 34 internationally regarding the potential impact of GHGs and possible means for their regulation Following a finding by the EPA that certain GHGs represent an endangerment to human health the EPA adopted two sets of rules regulating GHG emissions under the Clean Air Act one that requires a reduction in emissions of GHGs from motor vehicles and another that regulates emissions of GHGs from certain large stationary sources The EPA has also expanded its existing GHG emissions reporting requirements These permitting and reporting requirements could lead to further regulation of GHGs by the EPA As a distributor and transporter of natural gas or a consumer of natural gas in its pipeline and gathering businesses CERCs or Enables revenues operating costs and capital requirements as applicable could be adversely affected as a result of any regulatory action that would require installation of new control technologies or a modification of its operations or would have the effect of reducing the consumption of natural gas Our electric transmission and distribution business in contrast to some electric utilities does not generate electricity and thus is not directly exposed to the risk of high capital costs and regulatory uncertainties that face electric utilities that burn fossil fuels to generate electricity Nevertheless Houston Electrics revenues could be adversely affected to the extent any resulting regulatory action has the effect of reducing consumption of electricity by ultimate consumers within its service territory Likewise incentives to conserve energy or use energy sources other than natural gas could result in a decrease in demand for our services Climate changes could result in more frequent and more severe weather events which could adversely affect the results of operations of our businesses To the extent climate changes occur our businesses may be adversely impacted though we believe any such impacts are likely to occur very gradually and hence would be difficult to quantify with specificity To the extent global climate change results in warmer temperatures in our service territories financial results from our natural gas distribution businesses could be adversely affected through lower gas sales and Enables natural gas gathering processing and transportation and crude oil gathering businesses could experience lower revenues Another possible result of climate change is more frequent and more severe weather events such as hurricanes or tornadoes Since many of our facilities are located along or near the Gulf Coast increased or more severe hurricanes or tornadoes could increase our costs to repair damaged facilities and restore service to our customers When we cannot deliver electricity or natural gas to customers or our customers cannot receive our services our financial results can be impacted by lost revenues and we generally must seek approval from regulators to recover restoration costs To the extent we are unable to recover those costs or if higher rates resulting from our recovery of such costs result in reduced demand for our services our future financial results may be adversely impacted We may be negatively impacted by changes in federal income tax policy The Executive and Legislative Branches of the United States Federal government have made public statements in support of comprehensive tax reform plans including significant changes to corporate income tax laws We are currently unable to predict whether these reform discussions will result in any significant changes to existing tax laws or if any such changes would have a cumulative positive or negative impact on us or our regulatory activities It is possible that changes in the United States federal income tax laws could have an adverse effect on our or Enables results of operations financial condition and cash flows CERC and Enable may incur significant costs and liabilities resulting from pipeline integrity and other similar programs and related repairs The DOT has adopted regulations requiring pipeline operators to develop integrity management programs for transportation pipelines located in high consequence areas which are those areas where a leak or rupture could do the most harm The regulations require pipeline operators including CERC and Enable to among other things  perform ongoing assessments of pipeline integrity  develop a baseline plan to prioritize the assessment of a covered pipeline segment  identify and characterize applicable threats that could impact a high consequence area  improve data collection integration and analysis  develop processes for performance management record keeping management of change and communication  repair and remediate pipelines as necessary and  implement preventive and mitigating action 35 Recent regulatory proposals from PHMSA would expand the scope of its safety reporting and recordkeeping requirements for both natural gas and hazardous liquids including crude oil and NGLs pipelines as well as underground natural gas storage facilities These proposals if finalized would impose additional costs on us and Enable In March 2016 PHMSA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking detailing proposed revisions to the safety standards applicable to natural gas transmission and gathering pipelines The proposed rules include significant modifications which if adopted will result in significant operational and integrity management changes These include requiring reconfirmation of the Maximum Allowable Operating Pressures in pipelines without reliable records creating new material verification procedures adding a new moderate consequence area and tightening repair criteria for pipelines in both high and moderate consequence areas Other modifications include adding recordkeeping and data collection obligations and new requirements for monitoring gas quality and managing corrosion The proposed rules also would expand the scope of gas gathering lines subject to PHMSA regulation including imposing minimum safety standards on certain larger currently exempt gathering lines while subjecting all gatheringline operators to recordkeeping and annual reporting requirements from which they are currently exempt Other proposed changes such as the modification to the definition of a transmission line some recordkeeping requirements and some material verification obligations also may impact distribution pipelines although PHMSA states that such farreaching applicability is not its intent PHMSA is currently reviewing thousands of public comments submitted in July 2016 Because the impact of these proposed rules remains uncertain we are still monitoring and evaluating the effect of these proposed requirements on operations PHMSA also issued a similar notice of proposed rulemaking for hazardous liquid pipelines in October 2015 Both of these notices of proposed rulemaking would require inspections of pipeline areas affected by severe weather natural disasters or similar events In addition the proposed hazardous liquid rule would extend PHMSA reporting requirements to all gathering lines require periodic inline inspections of pipelines outside of high consequence areas require use of leak detection systems on all hazardous liquid pipelines modify applicable repair criteria and set a timeline for pipelines subject to integrity management requirements to be capable of accommodating inline inspection tools PHMSA issued the final rule for hazardous liquid pipelines on January 13 2017 but the rules eventual implementation and effectiveness are uncertain as a result of a January 20 2017 regulatory freeze We will continue to monitor the status of this rulemaking and the effect of these proposed requirements on operations On December 14 2016 PHMSA announced an interim final rule to impose industrydeveloped recommendations as enforceable safety standards for downhole underground equipment including wells wellbore tubing and casing at both interstate and intrastate underground natural gas storage facilities This rule went into effect on January 18 2017 with a compliance deadline of January 18 2018 Both CERC and Enable own and operate underground storage facilities that will be subject to this rules provisions which include procedures and practices for operations maintenance threat identification monitoring assessment site security emergency response and preparedness training and recordkeeping States may also impose more stringent standards on intrastate storage facilities CERC and Enable continue to assess the potential impact of this newly announced rule Although many of CERCs and Enables pipelines fall within a class that is currently not subject to the requirements in PHMSAs recent proposals they may nonetheless incur significant cost and liabilities associated with repair remediation prevention or mitigation measures associated with their nonexempt pipelines which are subject to existing requirements Work associated with PHMSA requirements is part of CERCs and Enables normal integrity management program and neither expect to incur any extraordinary costs during 2017 to complete the testing required by existing DOT regulations and their state counterparts CERC and Enable have not estimated the costs for any repair remediation preventive or mitigation actions that may be determined to be necessary as a result of the testing program which could be substantial or any lost cash flows resulting from shutting down their pipelines during the pendency of such repairs Should CERC or Enable fail to comply with DOT or comparable state regulations they could be subject to penalties and fines Aging infrastructure may lead to increased costs and disruptions in operations that could negatively impact our financial results CenterPoint Energy has risks associated with aging infrastructure assets The age of certain of our assets may result in a need for replacement or higher level of maintenance costs as a result of our risk based federal and state compliant integrity management programs Failure to achieve timely recovery of these expenses could adversely impact revenues and could result in increased capital expenditures or expenses The operation of our facilities depends on good labor relations with our employees Several of our businesses have entered into and have in place collective bargaining agreements with different labor unions There are seven separate bargaining units in CenterPoint Energy each with a unique collective bargaining agreement In 2016 Houston Electric entered into a renegotiated collective bargaining agreement with the IBEW Local 66 which is scheduled to expire in 2020 and CERC entered into two renegotiated collective bargaining agreements with Professional Employees 36 International Union Local 12 which are scheduled to expire in 2021 Two collective bargaining agreements with United Steelworkers Local 227 and United Steelworkers Local 131 are scheduled to expire in June and July of 2017 respectively The collective bargaining agreements with Gas Workers Union Local 340 and the IBEW Local 949 are scheduled to expire in April and December of 2020 respectively Any failure to reach an agreement on new labor contracts or to negotiate these labor contracts might result in strikes boycotts or other labor disruptions These potential labor disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our businesses results of operations andor cash flows Labor disruptions strikes or significant negotiated wage and benefit increases whether due to union activities employee turnover or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our businesses results of operations andor cash flows Our businesses will continue to have to adapt to technological change and may not be successful or may have to incur significant expenditures to adapt to technological change We operate in businesses that require sophisticated data collection processing systems software and other technology Some of the technologies supporting the industries we serve are changing rapidly We expect that new technologies will emerge or grow that may be superior to or may not be compatible with some of our existing technologies and may require us to make significant expenditures so that we can continue to provide costeffective and reliable methods of energy delivery Among such technological advances are distributed generation resources eg rooftop solar energy storage devices and more energyefficient buildings and products designed to reduce consumption As these technologies become a more costcompetitive option over time certain customers may choose to meet their own energy needs and subsequently decrease usage of our systems and services Our future success will depend in part on our ability to anticipate and adapt to these technological changes in a costeffective manner and to offer on a timely basis reliable services that meet customer demands and evolving industry standards If we fail to adapt successfully to any technological change or obsolescence or fail to obtain access to important technologies or incur significant expenditures in adapting to technological change our businesses operating results financial condition and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected Our or Enables potential business strategies and strategic initiatives including merger and acquisition activities and the disposition of assets or businesses may not be completed or perform as expected From time to time we and Enable have made and may continue to make acquisitions or divestitures of businesses and assets form joint ventures or undertake restructurings However suitable acquisition candidates or potential buyers may not continue to be available on terms and conditions we or Enable as the case may be find acceptable or the expected benefits of completed acquisitions may not be realized fully or at all or may not be realized in the anticipated timeframe If we or Enable are unable to make acquisitions or if those acquisitions do not perform as anticipated our and Enables future growth may be adversely affected Any completed or future acquisitions involve substantial risks including the following  acquired businesses or assets may not produce revenues earnings or cash flow at anticipated levels  acquired businesses or assets could have environmental permitting or other problems for which contractual protections prove inadequate  we or Enable may assume liabilities that were not disclosed to us that exceed our estimates or for which our rights to indemnification from the seller are limited  we or Enable may be unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully and realize anticipated economic operational and other benefits in a timely manner which could result in substantial costs and delays or other operational technical or financial problems and  acquisitions or the pursuit of acquisitions could disrupt ongoing businesses distract management divert resources and make it difficult to maintain current business standards controls and procedures For example the success of CERCs acquisitions of Continuum and AEM will depend in part on its ability to realize the expected benefits including operating efficiencies cost savings and customer retention from integrating Continuum and AEM with its existing energy services business The integration process could be costly and time consuming and may result in the following challenges among others  unanticipated disruptions issues or costs in integrating financial and accounting information technology communications and other systems 37  potential inconsistencies in procedures practices policies controls and standards  possible differences in compensation arrangements management perspectives and corporate culture and  loss of or difficulties retaining valuable employees or thirdparty relationships Even with the successful integration of the businesses CERC may not achieve the expected results CERC anticipates that its acquisitions of Continuum and AEM will be accretive to earnings in 2017 Any of the factors addressed above could decrease or delay the projected accretive effect of the transaction Failure to fully realize the expected benefits could adversely affect CERCs results of operations financial condition and cash flows In February 2016 we announced that we were exploring the use of a REIT business model for all or part of our utility businesses We have completed our evaluation and have decided not to pursue forming a REIT structure for our utility business or any part thereof at this time We also announced that we were evaluating strategic alternatives for our investment in Enable including a sale or spinoff qualifying under Section 355 of the US Internal Revenue Code and we continue to evaluate our alternatives including retaining our investment There can be no assurances that these evaluations will result in any specific action and we do not intend to disclose further developments on these initiatives unless and until our board of directors approves a specific action or as otherwise required Our business could be negatively affected as a result of the actions of activist shareholders Publicly traded companies have increasingly become subject to campaigns by activist investors advocating corporate actions such as financial restructuring increased borrowing special dividends stock repurchases or even sales of assets or the entire company It is possible that activist shareholders may attempt to effect such changes or acquire control over us Responding to proxy contests and other actions by activist shareholders can be costly and timeconsuming disrupt our operations and divert the attention of our board of directors and senior management from the pursuit of business strategies which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition Additionally perceived uncertainties as to our future direction as a result of shareholder activism or changes to the composition of the board of directors may lead to the perception of a change in the direction of the business instability or lack of continuity This may be exploited by our competitors cause concern to our current or potential customers and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel Our bylaws designate the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas or if such court lacks jurisdiction the state district court of Harris County Texas as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our shareholders which could limit our shareholders flexibility in obtaining a judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors officers or employees Our bylaws provide that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas or if such court lacks jurisdiction the state district court of Harris County Texas will be the sole and exclusive forum for i any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf ii any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director officer or other employee of ours to us or our shareholders iii any action asserting a claim against us or any director officer or other employee of ours pursuant to any provision of our articles of incorporation or bylaws as either may be amended from time to time or the Texas Business Organizations Code and iv any action asserting a claim against us or any director officer or other employee of ours governed by the internal affairs doctrine These exclusive forum provisions may limit a shareholders ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors officers or other employees or agents which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors officers employees or agents Alternatively if a court were to find these provisions of our bylaws inapplicable to or unenforceable in respect of one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions which could adversely affect our business and financial condition We are involved in numerous legal proceedings the outcome of which are uncertain and resolutions adverse to us could negatively affect our financial results We are subject to numerous legal proceedings the most significant of which are summarized in Note14 of the consolidated financial statements Litigation is subject to many uncertainties and we cannot predict the outcome of individual matters with assurance Final resolution of these matters may require additional expenditures over an extended period of time that may be in excess of established reserves and may have a material adverse effect on our financial results 38 We are exposed to risks related to reduction in energy consumption due to factors including unfavorable economic conditions in our service territories energy efficiency initiatives and use of alternative technologies Our businesses are affected by reduction in energy consumption due to factors including economic climate in our service territories energy efficiency initiatives and use of alternative technologies which could impact our ability to grow our customer base and our rate of growth Declines in demand for electricity as a result of economic downturns in our regulated electric service territories will reduce overall sales and lessen cash flows especially as industrial customers reduce production and therefore consumption of electricity Although Houston Electric is subject to regulated allowable rates of return and recovery of certain costs under periodic adjustment clauses overall declines in electricity sold as a result of economic downturn or recession could reduce revenues and cash flows thereby diminishing results of operations Additionally prolonged economic downturns that negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows could result in future material impairment charges to writedown the carrying value of certain assets including goodwill to their respective fair values For example our electric business is largely concentrated in Houston Texas where a higher percentage of employment is tied to the energy sector relative to other regions of the country Given the significant decline in energy and commodity prices in 2015 and 2016 and resulting low commodity prices which we expect to continue in 2017 the rate of growth in employment in Houston has declined In the event economic conditions further decline the rate of growth in Houston and the other areas in which we operate may also deteriorate Increases in customer defaults or delays in payment due to liquidity constraints could negatively impact our cash flows and financial condition Growth in customer accounts and growth of customer usage each directly influence demand for electricity and the need for additional delivery facilities Customer growth and customer usage are affected by a number of factors outside our control such as mandated energy efficiency measures demandside management goals distributed generation resources and economic and demographic conditions such as population changes job and income growth housing starts new business formation and the overall level of economic activity Certain regulatory and legislative bodies have introduced or are considering requirements andor incentives to reduce energy consumption by certain dates Additionally technological advances driven by federal laws mandating new levels of energy efficiency in enduse electric devices or other improvements in or applications of technology could lead to declines in per capita energy consumption Some or all of these factors could result in a lack of growth or decline in customer demand for electricity or number of customers and may result in our failure to fully realize anticipated benefits from significant capital investments and expenditures which could have a material adverse effect on their financial position results of operations and cash flows Furthermore we currently have energy efficiency riders in place to recover the cost of energy efficiency programs Should we be required to invest in conservation measures that result in reduced sales from effective conservation regulatory lag in adjusting rates for the impact of these measures could have a negative financial impact If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls our ability to accurately report our financial condition results of operations or cash flows or prevent fraud may be adversely affected As a result investors could lose confidence in our financial reporting which could impact our businesses and the trading price of our securities Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports effectively prevent fraud and operate successfully as a public company If our efforts to maintain internal controls are not successful we are unable to maintain adequate controls over our financial reporting and processes in the future or we are unable to comply with our obligations under Section 404 of the SarbanesOxley Act of 2002 our operating results could be harmed or we may fail to meet our reporting obligations Ineffective internal controls also could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our securities Our businesses may be adversely affected by the intentional misconduct of our employees We are committed to living our core values of safety integrity accountability initiative and respect and complying with all applicable laws and regulations Despite that commitment and our efforts to prevent misconduct it is possible for employees to engage in intentional misconduct fail to uphold our core values and violate laws and regulations for individual gain through contract or procurement fraud misappropriation bribery or corruption fraudulent relatedparty transactions and serious breaches of our Ethics and Compliance Code and Standards of ConductBusiness Ethics policy among other policies If such intentional misconduct by employees should occur it could result in substantial liability higher costs increased regulatory scrutiny and negative public perceptions 39 Item 1B Unresolved Staff Comments None Item 2 Properties Character of Ownership We lease or own our
