149 billion in 2017  We are a service company We provide freight transportation services and logistics solutions to companies of all sizes in a wide variety of industries During 2017  we handled approximately 19 million shipments and worked with more than 120000 customers We operate through a network of offices in North America Europe Asia Australia New Zealand and South America We have developed global transportation and distribution networks to provide transportation and supply chain services worldwide As a result we have the capability of facilitating most aspects of the supply chain on behalf of our customers We have three reportable segments North American Surface Transportation NAST Global Forwarding and Robinson Fresh with our remaining operating segments reported as All Other and Corporate For financial information concerning our reportable segments and geographic regions refer to Note 9 of our consolidated financial statements As a third party logistics provider we enter into contractual relationships with a wide variety of transportation companies and utilize those relationships to efficiently and costeffectively arrange the transport of our customers freight We utilized approximately 73000 contracted transportation companies including motor carriers railroads primarily intermodal service providers and air and ocean carriers in 2017 Depending on the needs of our customer and their supply chain requirements we select and hire the appropriate transportation for each shipment Our model enables us to be flexible and provide solutions that optimize service for our customers As an integral part of our transportation services we provide a wide range of valueadded logistics services such as freight consolidation supply chain consulting and analysis optimization and reporting In addition to transportation we provide sourcing services under the trade name Robinson Fresh  Robinson Fresh Our sourcing services consist primarily of the buying selling andor marketing of fresh fruits vegetables and other valueadded perishable items It was our original business when we were founded in 1905 The foundation for much of our logistics expertise can be traced to our significant experience in handling produce and temperature controlled commodities We supply fresh produce through a network of independent produce growers and suppliers Our customers include grocery retailers restaurants foodservice distributors and produce wholesalers In many cases we also arrange the logistics and transportation of the products we sell and provide related supply chain services such as replenishment category management and managed procurement services We have developed proprietary brands of produce and have exclusive licensing agreements to distribute fresh and valueadded produce under recognized consumer brand names The produce for these brands is sourced through a preferred grower network and packed to order through contract packing agreements We have instituted quality assurance and monitoring procedures with each of these preferred growers Our flexible business model has been the main driver of our historical results and has positioned us for continued growth One of our competitive advantages is our network of offices Our employees are in close proximity to both customers and transportation providers which gives them broad knowledge of their local markets and enables them to respond quickly to customers and transportation providers changing needs Employees act as a team in their sales efforts customer service and operations A significant portion of most employees compensation is performanceoriented based on profitability and their contributions to the success of the company We believe this makes our employees more serviceoriented and focused on driving growth and maximizing office productivity Our network of offices work together to meet our customers needs and crosssell our services For large multilocation customers we often coordinate our efforts in global account centers or in one office and rely on multiple offices to deliver specific geographic or modal needs The majority of our global network operates on a single global technology platform called Navisphere  that is used to match customer needs with supplier capabilities to collaborate with other offices and to utilize centralized support resources to complete all facets of the transaction We have grown primarily through internal growth by increasing market share through the addition of new customers and expanding relationships with our current customers adding new services expanding our market presence and operations globally and hiring additional employees We continually look to grow through selective acquisitions In August 2017 we acquired Milgram  Company Ltd Milgram a provider of freight forwarding customs brokerage and surface transportation primarily in Canada The acquisition strengthens our freight forwarding and customs brokerage offerings in Canada Milgram operates primarily in our Global Forwarding segment 3 In September 2016 we completed the acquisition of APC Logistics APC a privately held company based in Australia for the purpose of expanding our global presence and bringing additional capabilities and expertise to our portfolio APC provides international freight forwarding and customs brokerage services in Australia and New Zealand APC operates in our Global Forwarding segment On January 1 2015 we acquired all of the outstanding stock of Freightquotecom Inc Freightquote for the purpose of enhancing our less than truckload LTL and truckload businesses and expanding our ecommerce capabilities Freightquote operates in our NAST segment Net revenues are a NonGAAP financial measure calculated as total revenues less the cost of purchased transportation and related services and the cost of purchased products sourced for resale We believe net revenues are a useful measure of our ability to source add value and sell services and products that are provided by third parties and we consider net revenues to be our primary performance measurement Accordingly the discussion of our results of operations focuses on the changes in our net revenues The reconciliation of total revenues to net revenues is presented below in thousands For the years ended December 31 2017 2016 2015

Logistics Services CH Robinson provides freight transportation and related logistics and supply chain services Our services range from commitments on a specific shipment to much more comprehensive and integrated relationships We execute these service commitments by hiring and training people developing proprietary systems and processes and utilizing a network of contracted transportation providers including but not limited to contract motor carriers railroads and air and ocean carriers We make a profit on the difference between what we charge to our customers for the totality of services provided to them and what we pay to the transportation providers to handle or transport the freight While industry definitions vary given our extensive contracting to create a flexible network of solutions we are generally referred to in the industry as a third party logistics company We provide all of the following transportation and logistics services  Truckload Through our contracts with motor carriers we have access to dry vans temperature controlled vans flatbeds and bulk capacity We help our customers connect with carriers who are interested in their lanes and product types and we help carriers find shipments to make effective use of their equipment  Less than Truckload LTL transportation involves the shipment of single or multiple pallets of freight We focus on shipments of a single pallet or larger although we handle any size shipment Through our contracts with motor carriers and our operating system we consolidate freight and freight information to provide our customers with a single source of information on their freight In many instances we will consolidate partial shipments for several customers into full truckloads  Intermodal Our intermodal transportation service is the shipment of freight in trailers or containers by a combination of truck and rail We have intermodal marketing agreements with container owners and all Class 1 railroads in North America and we arrange local pickup and delivery known as drayage through local contracted motor carriers In addition we own approximately 1500 intermodal containers and lease approximately 1700 containers 4  Ocean As a nonvessel ocean common carrier NVOCC or freight forwarder we consolidate shipments determine routing select ocean carriers contract for ocean shipments andor provide for local pickup and delivery of shipments  Air As a certified indirect air carrier Indirect Air Carrier or IAC or freight forwarder we organize air shipments and provide doortodoor service  Customs Our customs brokers are licensed and regulated by US Customs and Border Protection to assist importers and exporters in meeting federal requirements governing imports and exports  Other Logistics Services We provide feebased managed services warehousing services small parcel and other services Customers communicate their freight needs typically on a shipmentbyshipment basis to the CH Robinson team responsible for their account The team ensures that all appropriate information about each shipment is available in our proprietary operating system This information is entered by our employees by the customer through our web tools or received electronically from the customers systems We utilize the information from our operating system and other available sources to select the best available carrier based upon factors such as their service score equipment availability freight rates and other relevant factors Once the contracted carrier is selected we receive the contract carriers commitment to provide the transportation During the time when a shipment is executed we connect frequently with the contract carrier to track the status of the shipment to meet the unique needs of our customers For most of our transportation and logistics services we are a service provider By accepting the customers order we accept certain responsibilities for transportation of the shipment from origin to destination The carriers contract is with us not the customer and we are responsible for prompt payment of freight charges In the cases where we have agreed either contractually or otherwise to pay for claims for damage to freight while in transit we pursue reimbursement from the contracted carrier for the claims In our managed services business we are acting as the shippers agent In those cases the carriers contract is typically with the customer and we collect a fee for our services As a result of our logistics capabilities some of our customers have us handle all or a substantial portion of their freight transportation requirements Our employees price our services to provide a profit to us for the totality of services performed for the customer In some cases our services to the customer are priced on a spot market or transactional basis In a number of instances we have contracts with the customer in which we agree to handle an estimated number of shipments usually to specified destinations such as from the customers plant to a distribution center Our commitments to handle the shipments are usually at predetermined rates Most of our rate commitments are for one year or less and allow for renegotiation As is typical in the transportation industry most of these contracts do not include specific volume commitments When we enter into prearranged rate agreements for truckload services with our customers we usually have fuel surcharge agreements in addition to the underlying linehaul portion of the rate We purchase the majority of our truckload services from our contract truckload carriers on a spot market or transactional basis even when we are working with the customer on a contractual basis In a small number of cases we may get advance commitments from one or more contract carriers to transport contracted shipments for the length of our customer contract In those cases where we have prearranged rates with contract carriers there is a calculated fuel surcharge based on a mutually agreedupon formula In the course of providing daytoday transportation services our employees often identify opportunities for additional logistics services as they become more familiar with our customers daily operations and the nuances of our customers supply chains We offer a wide range of logistics services on a worldwide basis that reduce or eliminate supply chain inefficiencies We will analyze customers current transportation rate structures modes of shipping and carrier selection We can identify opportunities to consolidate shipments for cost savings We will suggest ways to improve operating and shipping procedures and manage claims We can help customers minimize storage through crossdocking and other flowthrough operations Many of these services are provided in connection with providing the transportation services and are not typically priced separately They are usually included as a part of the cost of transportation services provided by us based on the nature of the customer relationship In addition to these transportation services we may provide additional logistics services such as contract warehousing consulting transportation management and other services for which we are usually paid separately As we have emphasized integrated logistics solutions our relationships with many customers have broadened and we have become a key provider to them by managing a greater portion of their supply chains We may serve our customers through specially created teams and through several locations Our transportation services are provided to numerous international 5 customers through our worldwide network See Note 9 to our 2017 consolidated financial statements included in Part II Item 8 of this report for disclosure of our total revenues from domestic and foreign customers for the years ended December 31 2017  2016  and 2015 and our longlived assets as of December 31 2017  2016  and 2015 in the United States and in

2016 and 2015 For additional information see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of Part II of this report Sourcing Since we were founded in 1905 we have been in the business of sourcing fresh produce Much of our logistics expertise can be traced to our significant experience in handling produce and other perishable commodities Because of its perishable nature produce must be rapidly packaged carefully transported within tight timetables usually in temperature controlled equipment and quickly distributed to replenish highturnover inventories maintained by our customers In many instances we consolidate individual customers produce orders into truckload quantities at the point of origin and arrange for transportation of the truckloads often to multiple destinations Our sourcing customer base includes grocery retailers restaurants foodservice distributors and produce wholesalers Our sourcing services include inventory forecasting and replenishment brand management and category development services We have various national and regional branded produce programs including both proprietary brands and national licensed brands These programs contain a wide variety of high quality fresh bulk and value added fruits and vegetables These brands have expanded our market presence and relationships with many of our retail customers We have also instituted quality assurance and monitoring programs as part of our branded and preferred grower programs Sourcing accounted for approximately five percent of our net revenues in 2017 2016 and 2015 Organization Segment information We have continued to expand our services and diversify our business and have also made changes to align executive oversight to the business We have three reportable segments NAST Global Forwarding and Robinson Fresh with our remaining operating segments reported as All Other and Corporate The All Other and Corporate segment includes Managed Services Other Surface Transportation outside of North America and other miscellaneous revenues and unallocated corporate expenses See additional disclosure in Note 9 to our consolidated financial

operating segment Europe Surface Transportation provides services similar to NAST across Europe Office Network To keep us close to our customers and markets we operate through a network of offices in North America Europe Asia Australia New Zealand and South America Each office is responsible for its own growth and profitability Our employees are responsible for developing new business negotiating and pricing services receiving and processing service requests from customers and negotiating with carriers to provide the transportation requested In addition to routine transportation employees are often called upon to handle customers unusual seasonal and emergency needs Shipments to be transported by truck are priced at the local level and offices cooperate with each other to hire contract carriers to provide transportation Employees often rely on expertise in other offices when contracting LTL intermodal ocean and air shipments Multiple network offices often also work together to service larger global accounts where the expertise and resources of more than one office are required to meet the customers needs Their efforts are usually coordinated by one lead office on the account Network Employees Employees both sell to and service their customers Sales opportunities are identified through our internal database referrals from current customers leads generated by people through knowledge of their local and regional markets and company marketing efforts Employees are also responsible for recruiting new motor carriers who are referred to our centralized carrier services group to confirm they are properly licensed and insured have acceptable Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration FMCSA issued safety ratings and will enter into a contract for transportation services with CH Robinson Each office is responsible for its hiring and headcount decisions based on the needs of their office and to balance personnel resources with business requirements Because the quality of our employees is essential to our success we are highly selective in our recruiting and hiring To support our hiring processes we have a corporate talent acquisition team that develops a pipeline of qualified candidates that managers can draw from Our applicants typically have college degrees and some have business experience although not necessarily within the transportation industry Our employees go through centralized onboarding that emphasizes development of the skills necessary to become productive employees including technology training on our proprietary systems and our customer service philosophy Centralized training is followed by ongoing onthejob training We expect most new employees to start contributing in a matter of weeks Compensation programs are performancebased and cash incentives are directly tied to productivity and performance Most network management compensation is dependent on the profitability of their particular office They are paid a performancebased bonus which is a portion of the offices earnings for that calendar year The percentage they can potentially earn is predetermined in an annual bonus contract and is based on their productivity and contributions to the overall success of the office All of our managers and certain other employees who have significant responsibilities are eligible to receive equity awards because we believe these awards are an effective tool for creating longterm ownership and alignment between employees and our shareholders Generally these awards are eligible to vest over fiveyear periods and may also include financial performancebased requirements for management employees Employees benefit both through the growth and profitability of individual offices and by achieving individual goals They are motivated by the opportunity to advance in a variety of career paths including management corporate sales and customer and carrier account management Shared Services Our network offices are supported by our shared and centralized services Approximately ten percent of our employees provide shared services in centralized centers Approximately 50 percent of

employees approximately 13700 of whom were located in our network offices Our remaining employees centrally serve our network of offices in areas such as finance information technology legal marketing and human resources Customer Relationships We work to establish longterm relationships with our customers and to increase the amount of business done with each customer by providing them with a full range of logistics services During 2017  we served over 120000 customers worldwide ranging from Fortune 100 companies to small businesses in a wide variety of industries During 2017  our largest customer accounted for approximately two percent of total revenues In recent years we have grown by adding new customers and by increasing our volumes with and providing more services to our existing customers We seek additional business from existing customers and pursue new customers based on our knowledge of the marketplace and the range of logistics services that we can provide We believe that our account management disciplines and decentralized structure enable our employees to better serve our customers by combining a broad knowledge of logistics and market conditions with a deep understanding of the specific supply chain issues facing individual customers and certain vertical industries With the guidance of our executive and shared services teams offices are given significant latitude to pursue opportunities and to commit our resources to serve our customers Relationships with Transportation Providers We continually work on establishing contractual relationships with qualified transportation providers that also meet our service requirements to provide dependable services favorable pricing and contract carrier availability during periods when demand for transportation equipment is greater than the supply Because we own very little transportation equipment and do not employ the people directly involved with the delivery of our customers freight these relationships are critical to our success In 2017  we worked with approximately 73000 transportation providers worldwide of which the vast majority are contracted motor carriers To strengthen and maintain our relationships with motor carriers our employees regularly communicate with 9 carriers and try to assist them by increasing their equipment utilization reducing their empty miles and repositioning their equipment To make it easier for contract carriers to work with us we have a policy of payment upon receipt of proof of delivery For those contract carriers who would like a faster payment we also offer payment within 48 hours of receipt of proof of delivery in exchange for a discount along with offering intrip cash advances Contracted motor carriers provide access to dry vans temperature controlled vans flatbeds and bulk capacity These contract carriers are of all sizes including owneroperators of a single truck small and midsize fleets private fleets and the largest national trucking companies Consequently we are not dependent on any one contract carrier Our largest truck transportation provider was less than two percent of our total cost of transportation in 2017  Motor carriers that had fewer than 100 tractors transported approximately 82 percent of our truckload shipments in 2017  Every United States and Canadian motor carrier with which we do business is required to execute a contract that establishes that the carrier is acting as an independent contractor At the time the contract is executed and thereafter through subscriptions with a third party service we confirm that each United States motor carrier is properly licensed and insured has the necessary federallyissued authority to provide transportation services and has the ability to provide the necessary level of service on a dependable basis Our motor carrier contracts require that the motor carrier issue invoices only to and accept payment solely from us for the shipments that they transport under their contract with us and allow us to withhold payment to satisfy previous claims or shortages Our standard contracts do not include volume commitments and the initial contract rate is modified each time we confirm an individual shipment with a carrier We also have intermodal marketing agreements with container owners and all Class 1 railroads in North America giving us access to additional trailers and containers Our contracts with railroads specify the transportation services and payment terms by which our intermodal shipments are transported by rail Intermodal transportation rates are typically negotiated between us and the railroad on a customerspecific basis We own approximately 1500 53foot containers and lease approximately 1700 containers We believe that these containers have helped us better serve our customers and we will continue to analyze the strategy of controlling containers In our NVOCC ocean transportation business we have contracts with most of the major ocean carriers which support a variety of service and rate needs for our customers We negotiate annual contracts that establish the predetermined rates we agree to pay the ocean carriers The rates are negotiated based on expected volumes from our customers in specific trade lanes These contracts are often amended throughout the year to reflect changes in market conditions for our business such as additional trade lanes We operate both as a consolidator and as a transactional IAC in the United States and internationally We select air carriers and provide for local pickup and delivery of shipments We execute our air freight services through our relationships with air carriers through charter services block space agreements capacity space agreements and transactional spot market negotiations Through charter services we contract part or all of an airplane to meet customer requirements Our block space agreements and capacity space agreements are contracts for a defined time period The contracts include fixed allocations for predetermined flights at agreed upon rates that are reviewed periodically throughout the year The transactional negotiations afford us the ability to capture excess capacity at prevailing market rates for a specific shipment Competition The transportation services industry is highly competitive and fragmented We compete against a large number of logistics companies trucking companies property freight brokers carriers offering logistics services NVOCCs IACs and freight forwarders We also buy from and sell transportation services to companies that compete with us In our sourcing business we compete with produce brokers produce growers produce marketing companies produce wholesalers and foodservice buying groups We also buy from and sell produce to companies that compete with us We often compete with respect to price scope of services or a combination thereof but believe that our most significant competitive advantages are  People Smart dedicated empowered people act as an extension of our customers teams to innovate and execute their supply chain strategies  Process Proven processes and solutions combine strategy with practical experience for customized action plans that succeed in the real world  Technology Navisphere our proprietary technology provides flexibility global visibility customized solutions easy integration broad connectivity and advanced security 10  Network Our customers gain local presence regional expertise and multiple global logistics options from one of the worlds largest providers of logistics services  Relationships A large number of unique strong relationships provide global connections and valuable market knowledge  Portfolio of Services A wide selection of services and products help provide our customers with consistent capacity and service levels  Scale Our customers leverage our industryleading capacity broad procurement options and substantial shipment volumes for better efficiency service and marketplace advantages and  Stability Our financial strength discipline and consistent track record of success for strategic support of our customers supply chains Seasonality Historically our operating results have been subject to seasonal trends with operating income and earnings lower in the first quarter than in the other three quarters We believe this historical pattern has been the result of or influenced by numerous factors including national holidays weather patterns consumer demand economic conditions and other similar and subtle forces Although seasonal changes in the transportation industry have not had a significant impact on our cash flow or results of operations we expect this trend to continue and we cannot guarantee that it will not adversely impact us in the future Our results did not follow this pattern in 2017 due primarily to changing transportation costs and customer pricing during the second half of the year Proprietary Information Technology and Intellectual Property We rely on a combination of trademarks copyrights trade secrets and nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements to establish and protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology Additionally we have numerous registered trademarks trade names and logos in the United States and international locations Our information systems are essential to efficiently communicate service our customers and contracted carriers and manage our business In 2017  we executed approximately 19 million shipments for more than 120000 customers with more than 73000 contract carriers Our systems help our employees service customer orders select the optimal mode of transportation build and consolidate shipments and identify appropriate carriers all based on customerspecific service parameters Our systems provide our organization with the necessary business intelligence to allow for near real time scorecards and necessary decision support in all areas of our business Our operations primarily use Navisphere a single global platform that allows customers to communicate worldwide with parties in their supply chain across languages currencies and continents Navisphere offers sophisticated business analytics to help improve supply chain performance and meet increasing customer demands The Navisphere Vision webbased product allows our customers to see all of their freight across all modes and services globally in a single view Details of shipment contents status of shipments based on milestones disruptions to shipments and resulting estimated time of arrival adjustment using Artificial Intelligence are provided for the user to manage their supply chain exceptions Collaboration intelligent notifications and performance score carding allow customers to manage their supply chain and identify inefficiencies The Navisphere Carrier webbased platform provides contracted carriers additional access to our systems Contract carriers can access available freight perform online check calls keep track of receivables and upload scanned documentation Many of our carriers favorite features from Navisphere Carrier are also available through our Navisphere Carrier mobile application available for Android and IOS mobile operating systems The Navisphere Driver mobile application provides drivers with load status automation capabilities Drivers can elect to allow the application to complete all stop updates and intransit calls Drivers can also capture and upload bill of lading documentation to initiate payment processes The high fidelity track and trace capabilities give our systems and customers frequent load status information 11 Government Regulation Our operations may be regulated and licensed

and Border Protection We also have and maintain other licenses as required by law Although Congress enacted legislation in 1994 that substantially preempts the authority of states to exercise economic regulation of motor carriers and brokers of freight some intrastate shipments for which we arrange transportation may be subject to additional licensing registration or permit requirements We generally contractually require andor rely on the carrier transporting the shipment to ensure compliance with these types of requirements We along with the contracted carriers that we rely on in arranging transportation services for our customers are also subject to a variety of federal and state safety and environmental regulations Although compliance with the regulations governing licensees in these areas has not had a materially adverse effect on our operations or financial condition in the past there can be no assurance that such regulations or changes thereto will not adversely impact our operations in the future Violation of these regulations could also subject us to fines as well as increased claims liability We buy and sell fresh produce under licenses issued by the US Department of Agriculture as required by the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act Other sourcing and distribution activities may be subject to various federal and state food and drug statutes and regulations We are subject to a variety of other US and foreign laws and regulations including but not limited to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other similar antibribery and anticorruption statutes Risk Management and Insurance We contractually require all motor carriers we work with to carry at least 750000 in automobile liability insurance and 25000 in cargo insurance We also require all motor carriers to maintain workers compensation and other insurance coverage as required by law Most contacted carriers have insurance exceeding these minimum requirements Railroads which are generally selfinsured provide limited common carrier cargo loss or damage liability protection generally up to 250000 per shipment As a property freight broker we are not legally liable for loss or damage to our customers cargo In our customer contracts we may agree to assume cargo liability up to a stated maximum We typically do not assume cargo liability to our customers above minimum industry standards in our international freight forwarding ocean transportation or air freight businesses on international or domestic air shipments With regards to international freight forwarding ocean transportation international domestic air freight shipments and shipments transacted by Freightquote we offer our customers the option to purchase shippers interest coverage to insure goods in transit When we agree to store goods for our customers for longer terms we provide limited warehousemans coverage to our customers and typically contract for warehousing services from companies that provide us the same degree of coverage We maintain a broad cargo liability insurance policy to help protect us against catastrophic losses that may not be recovered from the responsible contracted carrier We also carry various liability insurance policies including automobile and general liability with a 200 million umbrella Our contingent automobile liability coverage has a retention of 5 million per incident As a seller of produce we may under certain circumstances have legal responsibility arising from produce sales We carry product liability coverage under our general liability and umbrella policies to cover tort claims The deductible on our general liability coverage is 250000 per incident In addition in the event of a recall we may be required to bear the costs of repurchasing transporting and destroying any allegedly contaminated product as well as potential consequential damages which were generally not insured We carry product recall insurance coverage of 50 million This policy has a retention of 5 million per incident 12 Investor Information We were reincorporated in Delaware in 1997 as the successor to a business existing in various legal forms since 1905 Our

anticipates intends will likely result estimates projects or similar expressions and variations thereof are intended to identify such forwardlooking statements Except for the historical information contained in this Form 10K the matters set forth in this document may be deemed to be forwardlooking statements that represent our expectations beliefs intentions or strategies concerning future events These forwardlooking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our historical experience or our present expectations including but not limited to such factors such as changes in economic conditions including uncertain consumer demand changes in market demand and pressures on the pricing for our services competition and growth rates within the third party logistics industry freight levels and increasing costs and availability of truck capacity or alternative means of transporting freight changes in relationships with existing contracted truck rail ocean and air carriers changes in our customer base due to possible consolidation among our customers our ability to successfully integrate the operations of acquired companies with our historic operations risks associated with litigation including contingent auto liability and insurance coverage risks associated with operations outside of the US risks associated with the potential impact of changes in government regulations risks associated with the produce industry including food safety and contamination issues fuel price increases or decreases or fuel shortages cybersecurity related risks the impact of war on the economy changes to our capital structure and other risks and uncertainties including those described below Forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date they are made We undertake no obligation to update these statements in light of subsequent events or developments 13 ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS The following are important factors that could affect our financial performance and could cause actual results for future periods to differ materially from our anticipated results or other expectations including those expressed in any forwardlooking statements made in this 10K We may also refer to this disclosure to identify factors that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed in other forwardlooking statements including those made in oral presentations such as telephone conferences and webcasts open to the public Economic recessions could have a significant adverse impact on our business The transportation industry historically has experienced cyclical fluctuations in financial results due to economic recession downturns in business cycles of our customers interest rate fluctuations and other economic factors beyond our control Deterioration in the economic environment subjects our business to various risks which may have a material and adverse impact on our operating results and cause us to not reach our longterm growth goals  Decrease in volumes A reduction in overall freight volumes in the marketplace reduces our opportunities for growth A significant portion of our freight is transactional or spot market opportunities The transactional market may be more impacted than the freight market by overall economic conditions In addition if a downturn in our customers business cycles causes a reduction in the volume of freight shipped by those customers particularly among certain national retailers or in the food beverage retail manufacturing paper or printing industries our operating results could be adversely affected  Credit risk and working capital Some of our customers may face economic difficulties and may not be able to pay us and some may go out of business In addition some customers may not pay us as quickly as they have in the past causing our working capital needs to increase  Transportation provider failures A significant number of our transportation providers may go out of business and we may be unable to secure sufficient equipment or other transportation services to meet our commitments to our customers  Expense management We may not be able to appropriately adjust our expenses to changing market demands Personnel expenses are our largest expense In order to maintain high variability in our business model it is necessary to adjust staffing levels to changing market demands In periods of rapid change it is more difficult to match our staffing levels to our business needs In addition we have other expenses that are fixed for a period of time and we may not be able to adequately adjust them in a period of rapid change in market demand Higher carrier prices may result in decreased net revenue margin Carriers can be expected to charge higher prices if market conditions warrant or to cover higher operating expenses Our net revenues and income from operations may decrease if we are unable to increase our pricing to our customers Increased demand for truckload services and changes in regulations may reduce available capacity and increase carrier pricing In some instances where we have entered into contract freight rates with customers in the event market conditions change and those contracted rates are below market rates we may be required to provide transportation services at a revenue loss Changing fuel costs and interruptions of fuel supplies may have an impact on our net revenue margins In our truckload transportation business which is the largest source of our net revenues fluctuating fuel prices may result in decreased net revenue margin While our different pricing arrangements with customers and contracted carriers make it very difficult to measure the precise impact we believe that fuel costs essentially act as a passthrough cost to our truckload business In times of fluctuating fuel prices our net revenue margin may also fluctuate 14 Our dependence on third parties to provide equipment and services may impact the delivery and quality of our transportation and logistics services We do not employ the people directly involved in delivering our customers freight We depend on independent third parties to provide truck rail ocean and air services and to report certain events to us including delivery information and freight claims These independent third parties may not fulfill their obligations to us preventing us from meeting our commitments to our customers This reliance also could cause delays in reporting certain events including recognizing revenue and claims In addition if we are unable to secure sufficient equipment or other transportation services from third parties to meet our commitments to our customers our operating results could be materially and adversely affected and our customers could switch to our competitors temporarily or permanently Many of these risks are beyond our control including  equipment shortages in the transportation industry particularly among contracted truckload carriers  changes in regulations impacting transportation  disruption in the supply or cost of fuel  reduction or deterioration in rail service and  unanticipated changes in transportation rates We are subject to negative impacts of changes in political and governmental conditions Our operations are subject to the influences of significant political governmental and similar changes and our ability to respond to them including  changes in political conditions and in governmental policies  changes in and compliance with international and domestic laws and regulations and  wars civil unrest acts of terrorism and other conflicts We may be subject to negative impacts of catastrophic events  A disruption or failure of our systems or operations in the event of a major earthquake weather event cyberattack heightened security measures actual or threatened terrorist attack strike civil unrest pandemic or other catastrophic event could cause delays in providing services or performing other critical functions A catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information systems could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations and adversely impact our operating results Our international operations subject us to operational and financial risks We provide services within and between foreign countries on an increasing basis Our business outside of the United States is subject to various risks including  changes in tariffs trade restrictions trade agreements and taxations  difficulties in managing or overseeing foreign operations and agents  limitations on the repatriation of funds because of foreign exchange controls  different liability standards and  intellectual property laws of countries that do not protect our rights in our intellectual property including but not limited to our proprietary information systems to the same extent as the laws of the United States The occurrence or consequences of any of these factors may restrict our ability to operate in the affected region andor decrease the profitability of our operations in that region As we continue to expand our business internationally we expose the company to increased risk of loss from foreign currency fluctuations and exchange controls as well as longer accounts receivable payment cycles Foreign currency fluctuations could result in currency translation exchange gains or losses or could affect the book value of our assets and liabilities Furthermore we may experience unanticipated changes to our income tax liabilities resulting from changes in geographical income mix and changing international tax legislation We have limited control over these risks and if we do not correctly anticipate changes in international economic and political conditions we may not alter our business practices in time to avoid adverse effects 15 Our ability to appropriately staff and retain employees is important to our variable cost model Our continued success depends upon our ability to attract and retain a large group of motivated salespeople and other logistics professionals In order to maintain high variability in our business model it is necessary to adjust staffing levels to changing market demands In periods of rapid change it is more difficult to match our staffing level to our business needs We cannot guarantee that we will be able to continue to hire and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel Because of our comprehensive employee training program our employees are attractive targets for new and existing competitors Continued success depends in large part on our ability to develop successful employees into managers We face substantial industry competition Competition in the transportation services industry is intense and broadbased We compete against traditional and nontraditional logistics companies including transportation providers that own equipment third party freight brokers technology matching services internet freight brokers carriers offering logistics services and ondemand transportation service providers We also compete against carriers internal sales forces In addition customers can bring inhouse some of the services we provide to them We often buy and sell transportation services from and to many of our competitors Increased competition could reduce our market opportunity and create downward pressure on freight rates and continued rate pressure may adversely affect our net revenue and income from operations In some instances where we have entered into contract freight rates with customers in the event market conditions change and those contracted rates are below market rates we may be required to provide transportation services at a revenue loss We rely on technology to operate our business We have internally developed the majority of our operating systems Our continued success is dependent on our systems continuing to operate and to meet the changing needs of our customers and users We rely on our technology staff and vendors to successfully implement changes to and maintain our operating systems in an efficient manner If we fail to maintain and enhance our operating systems we may be at a competitive disadvantage and lose customers As demonstrated by recent material and highprofile data security breaches computer malware viruses and computer hacking and phishing attacks have become more prevalent have occurred on our systems in the past and may occur on our systems in the future Previous attacks on our systems have not had a material financial impact on our operations but we cannot guarantee that future attacks will have little to no impact on our business Furthermore given the interconnected nature of the supply chain and our significant presence in the industry we believe that we may be an attractive target for such attacks Though it is difficult to determine what if any harm may directly result from any specific interruption or attack a significant impact on the performance reliability security and availability of our systems and technical infrastructure to the satisfaction of our users may harm our reputation impair our ability to retain existing customers or attract new customers and expose us to legal claims and government action each of which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and growth prospects Because we manage our business on a decentralized basis our operations may be materially adversely affected by inconsistent management practices We manage our business on a decentralized basis through a network of offices throughout North America Europe Asia Australia New Zealand and South America supported by executives and shared and centralized services with local management responsible for daytoday operations profitability personnel decisions the growth of the business and adherence to applicable local laws Our decentralized operating strategy can make it difficult for us to implement strategic decisions and coordinated procedures throughout our global operations In addition some of our offices operate with management sales and support personnel that may be insufficient to support growth in their respective location without significant central oversight and coordination Our decentralized operating strategy could result in inconsistent management practices and materially and adversely affect our overall profitability and expose us to litigation Our earnings may be affected by seasonal changes in the transportation industry Results of operations for our industry generally show a seasonal pattern as customers reduce shipments during and after the winter holiday season Historically operating income and earnings are lower in the first quarter than in the other three quarters We believe this historical pattern has been the result of or influenced by numerous factors including national holidays weather patterns consumer demand economic conditions and other similar and subtle forces Although seasonal changes in the transportation industry have not had a significant impact on our cash flow or results of operations we expect this trend to continue and we cannot guarantee that it will not adversely impact us in the future Our results did not follow this pattern in 2017 due primarily to changing transportation costs and customer pricing in the second half of the year 16 We are subject to claims arising from our transportation operations We use the services of thousands of transportation companies in connection with our transportation operations From time to time the drivers employed and engaged by the carriers we contract with are involved in accidents which may result in serious personal injuries The resulting types andor amounts of damages may be excluded by or exceed the amount of insurance coverage maintained by the contracted carrier Although these drivers are not our employees and all of these drivers are employees owneroperators or independent contractors working for carriers from time to time claims may be asserted against us for their actions or for our actions in retaining them Claims against us may exceed the amount of our insurance coverage or may not be covered by insurance at all In addition our automobile liability policy has a retention of 5 million per incident A material increase in the frequency or severity of accidents liability claims or workers compensation claims or unfavorable resolutions of claims could materially and adversely affect our operating results In addition significant increases in insurance costs or the inability to purchase insurance as a result of these claims could reduce our profitability Our involvement in the transportation of certain goods including but not limited to hazardous materials could also increase our exposure in the event one of our contracted carriers is involved in an accident resulting in injuries or contamination Our sourcing business is dependent upon the supply and price of fresh produce The supply and price of fresh produce is affected by weather and growing conditions such as drought insects and disease and other conditions over which we have no control Commodity prices can be affected by shortages or overproduction and are often highly volatile If we are unable to secure fresh produce to meet our commitments to our customers our operating results could be materially and adversely affected and our customers could switch to our competitors temporarily or permanently To assure access to certain commodities we occasionally make monetary advances to growers to finance their operations Repayment of these advances is dependent upon the growers ability to grow and harvest marketable crops Buying and reselling fresh produce exposes us to possible product liability Agricultural chemicals used on fresh produce are subject to various approvals and the commodities themselves are subject to regulations on cleanliness and contamination Product recalls in the produce industry have been caused by concern about particular chemicals and alleged contamination often leading to lawsuits brought by consumers of allegedly affected produce We may face claims for a variety of damages arising from the sale of produce which may include potentially uninsured consequential damages While we are insured for up to 201 million for product liability claims subject to a 250000 per incident deductible settlement of class action claims is often costly and we cannot guarantee that our liability coverage will be adequate and will continue to be available If we have to recall produce we may be required to bear the cost of repurchasing transporting and destroying any allegedly contaminated product as well as consequential damages We carry product recall insurance coverage of 50 million This policy has a retention of 5 million per incident Any recall or allegation of contamination could affect our reputation particularly of our proprietary andor licensed branded produce programs Loss due to spoilage including the need for disposal is also a routine part of the sourcing business Our business depends upon compliance with numerous government regulations Our operations may be regulated and licensed by various federal state and local transportation agencies in the United States and similar governmental agencies in foreign countries in which we operate We are subject to licensing and regulation as a property freight broker and are licensed by the DOT to arrange for the transportation of property by motor vehicle The DOT prescribes qualifications for acting in this capacity including certain surety bonding requirements We are also subject to regulation by the Federal Maritime Commission as an ocean freight forwarder and a NVOCC and we maintain separate bonds and licenses for each We operate as a Department of Homeland Security certified IAC providing air freight services subject to commercial standards set forth by the International Air Transport Association and federal regulations issued by the Transportation Security Administration We provide customs brokerage services as a customs broker under a license issued by the Bureau of US Customs and Border Protection We also have and maintain other licenses as required by law We source fresh produce under a license issued by the US Department of Agriculture We are also subject to various regulations and requirements promulgated by other international domestic state and local agencies and port authorities Our failure to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to entities holding these licenses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 17 Legislative or regulatory changes can affect the economics of the transportation industry by requiring changes in operating practices or influencing the demand for and the cost of providing transportation services As part of our logistics services we operate leased warehouse facilities Our operations at these facilities include both warehousing and distribution services and we are subject to various federal state and international environmental work safety and hazardous materials regulations We may experience an increase in operating costs such as security costs as a result of governmental regulations that have been and will be adopted in response to terrorist activities and potential terrorist activities No assurances can be given that we will be able to pass these increased costs on to our customers in the form of rate increases or surcharges and our operations and profitability may suffer as a result Department of Homeland Security regulations applicable to our customers who import goods into the United States and our contracted ocean carriers can impact our ability to provide andor receive services with and from these parties Enforcement measures related to violations of these regulations can slow andor prevent the delivery of shipments which may negatively impact our operations We cannot predict what impact future regulations may have on our business Our failure to maintain required permits or licenses or to comply with applicable regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of our operating permits and licenses Our contract carriers are subject to increasingly stringent laws protecting the environment including those relating to climate change which could directly or indirectly have a material adverse effect on our business Future and existing environmental regulatory requirements in the US and abroad could adversely affect operations and increase operating expenses which in turn could increase our purchased transportation costs If we are unable to pass such costs along to our customers our business could be materially and adversely affected Even without any new legislation or regulation increased public concern regarding greenhouse gases emitted by transportation carriers could harm the reputations of companies operating in the transportation logistics industries and shift consumer demand toward more locally sourced products and away from our services We derive a significant portion of our total revenues and net revenues from our largest customers Our top 100 customers comprise approximately 35 percent of our consolidated total revenues and 23 percent of consolidated net revenues Our largest customer comprises approximately two percent of our consolidated total revenues The sudden loss of many of our major clients could materially and adversely affect our operating results We may be unable to identify or complete suitable acquisitions and investments We may acquire or make investments in complementary businesses products services or technologies We cannot guarantee that we will be able to identify suitable acquisitions or investment candidates Even if we identify suitable candidates we cannot guarantee that we will make acquisitions or investments on commercially acceptable terms if at all The timing and number of acquisitions we pursue may also cause volatility in our financial results In addition we may incur debt or be required to issue equity securities to pay for future acquisitions or investments The issuance of any equity securities could be dilutive to our stockholders We may have difficulties integrating acquired companies For acquisitions success depends upon efficiently integrating the acquired business into our existing operations These risks could be heightened if we complete a large acquisition or multiple acquisitions within a short period of time We are required to integrate these businesses into our internal control environment which may present challenges that are different than those presented by organic growth and that may be difficult to manage If we are unable to successfully integrate and grow these acquisitions and to realize contemplated revenue synergies and cost savings our business prospects results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected Our growth and profitability may not continue which may result in a decrease in our stock price Our longterm growth objective is to grow earnings per share by 10 percent Longterm growth targets represent an over time perspective and do not necessarily represent an expected annual growth rate There can be no assurance that our longterm growth objective will be achieved or that we will be able to effectively adapt our management administrative and operational systems to respond to any future growth Future changes in and expansion of our business or changes in economic or political conditions could adversely affect our operating margins Slower or less profitable growth or losses could adversely affect our stock price ITEM 1B UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None 18 ITEM 2 PROPERTIES Our corporate headquarters is in Eden Prairie Minnesota The total square footage of our four buildings in Eden Prairie is 357000 This total includes approximately 221000 square feet used for our corporate and shared services our data center of approximately 18000 square feet and 118000 square feet used for office operations Most of our offices are leased from third parties under leases with initial terms ranging from three to fifteen years Our office locations range in space from 1000 to 208000 square feet Because we are a global enterprise

consider our current office spaces and warehouse facilities adequate for our current level of operations We have not had difficulty in obtaining sufficient office space and believe we can renew existing leases or relocate to new offices as leases expire We have entered into a lease for a building to be built in Chicago Illinois with a substantial completion date in 2018 The lease of approximately 200000 square feet will replace certain current space in Chicago that we own 19 ITEM 3 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS We are not subject to any pending or threatened litigation other than routine litigation arising in the ordinary course of our business operations For some legal proceedings we have accrued an amount that reflects the aggregate liability deemed probable and estimable but this amount is not material to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows Because of the preliminary nature of many of these proceedings the difficulty in ascertaining the applicable facts relating to many of these proceedings the inconsistent treatment of claims made in many of these proceedings and the difficulty of predicting the settlement value of many of these proceedings we are not able to estimate an amount or range of any reasonably possible additional losses However based upon our historical experience the resolution of these proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows ITEM 4 MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES Not applicable 20 PART II
