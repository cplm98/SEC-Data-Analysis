provides transportation and logistics services including truckload and groupage services across Europe Sales Transportation and Logistics Services CH Robinson provides freight transportation and related logistics and supply chain services Our services range from commitments on a specific shipment to much more comprehensive and integrated relationships We execute these service commitments by investing in and retaining talented employees developing innovative proprietary systems and processes and utilizing a network of contracted transportation providers including but not limited to contracted motor carriers railroads and ocean and air carriers We make a profit driven by the value we provide our customers and the resulting difference between what we charge to our customers for the totality of services provided to them and what we pay to the transportation providers to handle or transport the freight We provide the following transportation and logistics services  Truckload Through our contracts with motor carriers we have access to dry vans temperature controlled vans flatbeds and bulk capacity We connect our customers with contracted motor carriers that specialize in their transportation lanes and product types and we help contracted motor carriers optimize the usage of their equipment  LTL LTL transportation involves the shipment of single or multiple pallets of freight We primarily focus on shipments of a single pallet or larger although we handle any size shipment Through our contracts with motor carriers and use of Navisphere we consolidate freight and freight information to provide our customers with a single source of information on their freight In many instances we consolidate partial shipments for several customers into full truckloads  Ocean As a licensed NonVessel Ocean Common Carrier NVOCC and freight forwarder we consolidate shipments determine routing select ocean carriers contract for ocean shipments andor provide for local pickup and delivery of shipments  Air As a certified Indirect Air Carrier IAC and freight forwarder we organize air shipments and provide doortodoor service  Customs Our customs brokers are licensed and regulated by US Customs and Border Protection and other authoritative governmental agencies to assist importers and exporters in meeting regulatory and operational requirements governing imports and exports  Other Logistics Services We provide intermodal transportation service which is the shipment of freight in trailers or containers by a combination of truck and rail In addition we provide feebased Managed Services warehousing services small parcel and other services Customers communicate their freight needs typically on an orderbyorder basis to the CH Robinson team responsible for their account The team ensures that all necessary information regarding each shipment is available in Navisphere This information is received electronically by Navisphere from the customers system entered by our employees into Navisphere or by the customer through our web tools We utilize the information from Navisphere and other available sources to select the best contracted carrier based upon factors such as their service score equipment availability freight rates and other relevant factors Once the contracted carrier is selected we receive the contracted carriers commitment to provide the transportation During the time when a shipment is executed we connect frequently either electronically or manually with the contracted carrier to track the status of the shipment to meet the unique needs of our customers For most of our transportation and logistics services we are a service provider By accepting the customers order we accept certain responsibilities for transportation of the shipment from origin to destination The carriers contract is with us not the customer and we are responsible for prompt payment of freight charges In the cases where we have agreed to pay for claims for damage to freight while in transit we pursue reimbursement from the contracted carrier for the claims In our Managed Services business we are acting as the shippers agent In those cases the carriers contract is typically with the customer and we collect a fee for our services 4 Table of Content As a result of our logistics capabilities our technology and global suite of services some of our customers have us handle all or a substantial portion of their freight transportation requirements Our employees price our services to provide a profit to us for the totality of services performed for the customer Our services to the customer may be priced on a spot market or transactional basis or prearranged contractual rates Most of our contractual rate commitments are for one year or less and allow for renegotiation As is typical in the transportation industry most of these contracts do not include specific volume commitments When we enter into prearranged rate agreements for truckload services with our customers we usually have fuel surcharge agreements that allow for fuel to primarily act as a passthrough cost in addition to the underlying linehaul portion of the rate We purchase most of our truckload services from our contracted truckload carriers on a spot market or transactional basis even when we are working with the customer on a contractual basis In a small number of cases we may get advance commitments from one or more contracted motor carriers to transport contracted shipments for the length of our customer contract In those cases where we have prearranged rates with contracted motor carriers there is a calculated fuel surcharge based on a mutually agreedupon formula While providing daytoday transportation services our employees often identify opportunities for additional logistics services as they become more familiar with our customers daily operations and the nuances of our customers supply chains We offer a wide range of logistics services on a global basis that reduce or eliminate supply chain inefficiencies We analyze customers current transportation rate structures modes of shipping and carrier selection We identify opportunities to consolidate shipments for cost savings We suggest ways to improve operating and shipping procedures and manage claims We help customers minimize storage through crossdocking and other flowthrough operations Many of these services are provided in connection with providing the transportation services based on the nature of the customer relationship In addition to these transportation services we may provide additional logistics services such as contract warehousing consulting transportation management and other services for which we are usually paid separately We have broadened our relationship with many of our customers through an emphasis on integrated logistics solutions resulting in us managing a greater portion of their supply chains We often serve our customers through specially created teams and through multiple locations Our transportation and logistics services are provided to numerous international customers through our worldwide network Transportation services

logistics expertise can be traced to our significant experience in handling produce and other perishable commodities Because of its perishable nature produce must be rapidly packaged carefully transported within tight timetables usually in temperature controlled equipment and quickly distributed to replenish highturnover inventories maintained by our customers In many instances we consolidate an individual customers produce orders into truckload quantities at the point of origin and arrange for transportation of the truckloads often to multiple destinations Our sourcing customer base includes grocery retailers restaurants foodservice distributors and produce wholesalers Our sourcing services include inventory forecasting and replenishment brand management and category development services We have various national and regional branded produce programs including both proprietary brands and nationally licensed 5 Table of Content brands These programs contain a wide variety of high quality fresh bulk and value added fruits and vegetables These brands have expanded our market presence and relationships with many of our retail customers We have also instituted quality assurance and monitoring programs as part of our branded and preferred grower programs Sourcing accounted for approximately four percent of our adjusted gross profit in 2020 2019 and 2018 Customer Relationships We work to establish longterm relationships with our customers and to increase the amount of business done with each customer by providing them with a full range of

proprietary technology Additionally we have numerous registered trademarks trade names and logos in the United States and international locations Relationships with Transportation Providers We continually work on establishing contractual relationships with qualified transportation providers that also meet both ours and our customers service requirements to provide dependable services favorable pricing and available capacity during periods when demand for transportation equipment is greater than the supply We own very little transportation equipment and do not employ the people directly involved with the delivery of our customers freight so these relationships are critical to our success 7 Table of Content In 2020 we worked with approximately 73000 transportation providers worldwide of which the vast majority are contracted motor carriers To strengthen and maintain our relationships with contracted motor carriers our employees regularly communicate with them and try to assist them by increasing their equipment utilization reducing their empty miles and repositioning their equipment To make it easier for contracted motor carriers to work with us we have a policy of contracted motor carrier invoice payment upon receipt of proof of delivery in accordance with our standard payment terms For those contracted motor carriers that would like a faster payment we also offer expedited payment upon receipt of proof of delivery in exchange for a discount along with offering intrip cash advances Contracted motor carriers provide access to dry vans temperature controlled vans flatbeds and bulk capacity These contracted motor carriers are of all sizes including owneroperators of a single truck small and midsize fleets private fleets and the largest national trucking companies Consequently we are not dependent on any one contracted motor carrier Our largest truck transportation provider was less than two percent of our total cost of transportation in 2020 Contracted motor carriers that had fewer than 100 tractors transported approximately 78 percent of our truckload shipments in 2020 Every United States and Canadian motor carrier which we do business with is required to execute a contract that establishes that the motor carrier is acting as an independent contractor At the time the contract is executed and thereafter through subscriptions with a third party service we confirm that each United States contracted motor carrier is properly licensed and insured has the necessary federallyissued authority to provide transportation services and can provide the necessary level of service on a dependable basis Our motor carrier contracts require that the contracted motor carrier issue invoices only to and accept payment solely from us for the shipments that they transport under their contract with us and allow us to withhold payment to satisfy previous claims or shortages Our standard contracts do not include volume commitments and typically the initial contract rate is modified each time we confirm an individual shipment with a contracted motor carrier In our NVOCC ocean transportation business we have contracts with most of the major ocean carriers which support a variety of service and rate needs for our customers We negotiate annual contracts that establish the predetermined rates we agree to pay the ocean carriers The rates are negotiated based on expected volumes from our customers in specific trade lanes These contracts are often amended throughout the year to reflect changes in market conditions for our business such as additional trade lanes We operate both as a consolidator and as a transactional IAC in the United States and internationally We select air carriers and provide for local pickup and delivery of shipments We execute our air freight services through our relationships with air carriers through charter services block space agreements capacity space agreements and transactional spot market negotiations Through charter services we contract part or all of an airplane to meet customer requirements Our block space agreements and capacity space agreements are contracts for a defined time period The contracts include fixed allocations for predetermined flights at agreed upon rates that are reviewed periodically throughout the year The transactional negotiations afford us the ability to capture excess capacity at prevailing market rates for a specific shipment Seasonality Our operating results have been subject to seasonal trends as a result of or influenced by numerous factors including national holidays weather patterns consumer demand economic conditions and other similar and subtle forces Although seasonal changes in the transportation industry have not had a significant impact on our cash flow or results of operations we expect this trend to continue and we cannot guarantee that it will not adversely impact us in the future Government Regulation Our operations may be regulated and licensed by various federal state and local transportation agencies in the United States and similar governmental agencies in foreign countries in which we operate We are subject to licensing and regulation as a property freight broker and are licensed by the US Department of Transportation DOT to arrange for the transportation of property by motor vehicle The DOT prescribes qualifications for acting in this capacity including certain surety bonding requirements We are also subject to regulation by the Federal Maritime Commission FMC as an ocean freight forwarder and a NVOCC and we maintain separate bonds and licenses for each We operate as a Department of Homeland Security certified IAC providing air freight services subject to commercial standards set forth by the International Air Transport Association IATA and federal regulations issued by the Transportation Security Administration TSA We provide customs brokerage services as a customs broker under a license issued by the US Customs and Border Protection and other authoritative governmental agencies We also have and maintain other licenses as required by law Although Congress enacted legislation in 1994 that substantially preempts the authority of states to exercise economic regulation of motor carriers and brokers of freight some intrastate shipments for which we arrange transportation may be subject to additional licensing registration or permit requirements We contractually require and rely on the motor carrier 8 Table of Content transporting the shipment to ensure compliance with these types of requirements We along with the contracted motor carriers that we rely on in arranging transportation services for our customers are also subject to a variety of federal and state safety and environmental regulations Although compliance with the regulations governing licensees in these areas has not had a materially adverse effect on our operations or financial condition in the past there can be no assurance that such regulations or changes thereto will not adversely impact our operations in the future Violation of these regulations could also subject us to fines as well as increased

one of our primary competitive advantages They are logistics experts and problem solvers and act as an extension of our customers teams Our customers and contract carriers consistently cite our people and the strong value added relationships with our account teams as a primary reason they choose to work with us Our innovative talent strategies support the development and empowerment of our people enabling the success of our customers and contract carriers and helping drive our growth strategy Working with their regional or divisional leaders each team makes hiring decisions based on balancing business needs with personnel investment and meeting targeted productivity and profitability goals Our continued success depends in large part on our ability to hire strong diverse talent and retain and develop successful employees Our employee turnover ratio which is calculated as the number of employees who departed the Company in the twelve months ended December 31 2020 divided by the average number of employees in the twelve months ended December 31 2020 was 18 percent On average our managers lead a team of six direct reports Because the quality of our employees is essential to our success we are highly selective in our recruiting and hiring To support our hiring processes we have a corporate talent acquisition team that develops a robust diverse pipeline of qualified candidates that managers can draw from Our employees go through onboarding that emphasizes development of the skills necessary to become productive employees including technology training on our proprietary systems and our customer service philosophy Centralized training is followed by ongoing onthejob training and regular performance and career development reviews Ongoing employee development is an important component of our talent strategy therefore our employees and managers have performance conversations on a regular basis at least twice per year In 2020 approximately 97 percent of our workforce received regular performance and career development reviews In addition on an annual basis we conduct an employee engagement survey to assess employee engagement which is measured by willingness to recommend a company intent to stay pride and the experience of intrinsic motivation on the job The 2020 survey indicated a positive engagement score of 81 percent which was consistent with benchmark companies 9 Table of Content Our marketcompetitive compensation programs help drive performance and reward success They include performancebased metrics and cash incentives directly tied to productivity the achievement of specific performance goals and the financial performance of the team or the organization overall A significant portion of management compensation is dependent on the growth and profitability of their team Senior managers are paid a performancebased bonus which is measured based on balanced growth in top and bottom line performance of the team they represent for that calendar year The percentage they can potentially earn is predetermined in an annual bonus contract and is based on their role and the overall success of the team A majority of our managers and certain other employees who have significant responsibilities are eligible to receive equity awards because we believe these awards are an effective tool for creating longterm ownership and alignment between employees and our shareholders Refer to Note 6 Capital Stock and Stock Award Plans for further discussion related to equity award plan design Employees benefit both through the growth and profitability of their team and by achieving individual goals They are motivated by the opportunity to advance in a variety of career paths including management corporate sales and customer and carrier account management Network Employees We have defined job families and roles to enable our employees to specialize in particular areas of the business and build their expertise We believe this enables them to perform at a higher level and create more value for our customers and contract carriers Some of our employees choose to stay in that area of specialization while others progress across multiple areas of the business to build a broader base of experience We believe our strategy of having multiple career path opportunities enables our employees to develop to their highest potential and choose a career plan that fits their goals and aspirations We also believe this drives higher engagement and retention Depending on their role our employees are responsible for developing new business negotiating and pricing services receiving and processing service requests from customers and negotiating with carriers to provide the transportation requested In addition to routine transportation employees are often called upon to handle customers unusual seasonal and emergency needs We have developed industry leading technology and complex proprietary pricing algorithms based on our information advantage that guide our employees regarding establishing competitive pricing with our customers and contracted motor carriers based on the unique characteristics of each customers shipment Employees typically rely on expertise in other offices when contracting and executing truckload LTL ocean and air shipments Multiple network offices often also work together to service larger global accounts where the expertise and resources of more than one office are required to meet the customers needs Their efforts are usually coordinated by one lead office on the account Employees are generally specialized into roles on new customer sales opportunities account managing existing customer relationships managing contracted carriersupplier relationships for procuring capacity or ongoing service and operations of shipments Customer sales opportunities are identified through our internal database referrals from current customers leads generated by people

13 Table of Content ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS The following are material factors that could affect our financial performance and could cause actual results for future periods to differ materially from our anticipated results or other expectations including those expressed in any forwardlooking statements made in this 10K We may also refer to this disclosure to identify factors that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed in other forwardlooking statements including those made in oral presentations such as telephone conferences and webcasts open to the public Business environment and competition risk factors Economic recessions could have a significant adverse impact on our business The transportation industry historically has experienced cyclical fluctuations in financial results due to economic recession downturns in business cycles of our customers interest rate fluctuations currency fluctuations and other economic factors beyond our control Deterioration in the economic environment subjects our business to various risks which may have a material and adverse impact on our operating results and cause us to not reach our longterm growth goals  Decrease in volumes A reduction in overall freight volumes in the marketplace reduces our opportunities for growth A significant portion of our freight are transactional or spot market opportunities The transactional market may be more impacted than the contractual freight market by overall economic conditions In addition if a downturn in our customers business cycles causes a reduction in the volume of freight shipped by those customers particularly among certain national retailers or in the food beverage retail manufacturing paper ecommerce or printing industries our operating results could be adversely affected  Credit risk and working capital Some of our customers may face economic difficulties and may not be able to pay us and some may go out of business In addition some customers may not pay us as quickly as they have in the past causing our working capital needs to increase  Transportation provider failures A significant number of our contracted transportation providers may go out of business and we may be unable to secure sufficient equipment or other transportation services to meet our commitments to our customers  Expense management We may not be able to appropriately adjust our expenses to changing market demands In order to maintain high variability in our business model it is necessary to adjust staffing levels to changing market demands In periods of rapid change it is more difficult to match our staffing levels to our business needs In addition we have other expenses that are fixed for a period of time and we may not be able to adequately adjust them in a period of rapid change in market demand Higher carrier prices may result in decreased adjusted gross profit margin Carriers can be expected to charge higher prices if market conditions warrant or to cover higher operating expenses Our adjusted gross profit and income from operations may decrease if we are unable to increase our pricing to our customers Increased demand for over the road transportation services and changes in regulations may reduce available capacity and increase motor carrier pricing In some instances where we have entered into contract freight rates with customers in the event market conditions change and those contracted rates are below market rates we may be required to provide transportation services at a loss Changing fuel costs and interruptions of fuel supplies may have an impact on our adjusted gross profit margins In our truckload transportation business which is the largest source of our adjusted gross profits fluctuating fuel prices may result in decreased adjusted gross profit margin While our different pricing arrangements with customers and contracted motor carriers make it very difficult to measure the precise impact we believe that fuel costs essentially act as a passthrough cost to our truckload business In times of fluctuating fuel prices our adjusted gross profit margin may also fluctuate Adjusted gross profit margin is a nonGAAP financial measure calculated as adjusted gross profit divided by total revenues For additional information see Item 7 of Part II Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 14 Table of Content Our dependence on third parties to provide equipment and services may impact the delivery and quality of our transportation and logistics services We do not employ the people directly involved in delivering our customers freight We depend on independent third parties to provide truck rail ocean and air services and to report certain events to us including but not limited to shipment status information and freight claims These independent third parties may not fulfill their obligations to us preventing us from meeting our commitments to our customers This reliance also could cause delays in reporting certain events including recognizing claims In addition if we are unable to secure sufficient equipment or other transportation services from third parties to meet our commitments to our customers our operating results could be materially and adversely affected and our customers could switch to our competitors temporarily or permanently Many of these risks are beyond our control including  equipment shortages in the transportation industry particularly among contracted motor carriers  changes in regulations impacting transportation  disruption in the supply or cost of fuel  reduction or deterioration in rail service and  unanticipated changes in freight markets We face substantial industry competition Competition in the transportation services industry is intense and broadbased We compete against traditional and nontraditional logistics companies including transportation providers that own equipment third party freight brokers technology matching services internet freight brokers carriers offering logistics services and ondemand transportation service providers We also compete against carriers internal sales forces In addition customers can bring inhouse some of the services we provide to them We often buy and sell transportation services from and to many of our competitors Increased competition could reduce our market opportunity and create downward pressure on freight rates and continued rate pressure may adversely affect our adjusted gross profit and income from operations In some instances where we have entered into contract freight rates with customers in the event market conditions change and those contracted rates are below market rates we may be required to provide transportation services at a loss Our sourcing business is dependent upon the supply and price of fresh produce The supply and price of fresh produce is affected by weather and growing conditions including but not limited to flood drought freeze insects disease and other conditions over which we have no control Commodity prices can be affected by shortages or overproduction and are often highly volatile If we are unable to secure fresh produce to meet our commitments to our customers our operating results could be materially and adversely affected and our customers could switch to our competitors temporarily or permanently To assure access to certain commodities we occasionally make monetary advances to growers to finance their operations Repayment of these advances is dependent upon the growers ability to grow and harvest marketable crops Our earnings may be affected by seasonal changes in the transportation industry Results of operations for our industry generally show a seasonal pattern as customers reduce shipments during and after the winter holiday season Historically income from operations and earnings are lower in the first quarter than in the other three quarters We believe this historical pattern has been the result of or influenced by numerous factors including national holidays weather patterns consumer demand economic conditions and other similar and subtle forces Although seasonal changes in the transportation industry have not had a significant impact on our cash flow or results of operations we expect this trend to continue and we cannot guarantee that it will not adversely impact us in the future We may be unable to identify or complete suitable acquisitions and investments We may acquire or make investments in complementary businesses products services or technologies We cannot guarantee that we will be able to identify suitable acquisitions or investment candidates Even if we identify suitable candidates we cannot guarantee that we will make acquisitions or investments on commercially acceptable terms if at all The timing and number of acquisitions we pursue may also cause volatility in our financial results In addition we may incur debt or be required to issue equity securities to pay for future acquisitions or investments The issuance of any equity securities could be dilutive to our stockholders Company risk factors We rely on technology to operate our business We have internally developed the majority of our operating systems Our continued success is dependent on our systems continuing to operate and to meet the changing needs of our customers and users We rely on our technology staff and vendors to successfully implement changes to and maintain our operating systems in an efficient manner If we fail to maintain protect and enhance our operating systems we may be at a competitive disadvantage and lose customers 15 Table of Content As demonstrated by recent material and highprofile data security breaches computer malware viruses computer hacking and phishing attacks have become more prevalent have occurred on our operating systems in the past and may occur on our operating systems in the future Previous attacks on our operating systems have not had a material financial impact on our operations but we cannot guarantee that future attacks will have little to no impact on our business Furthermore given the interconnected nature of the supply chain and our significant presence in the industry we believe that we may be an attractive target for such attacks We maintain a cyber liability insurance policy with coverage of 10 million to help protect us against losses that may result from a cyberrelated security breach or similar event The policy has a retention of 1 million per incident Though it is difficult to determine what if any harm may directly result from any specific interruption or attack a significant impact on the performance reliability security and availability of our operating systems and technical infrastructure to the satisfaction of our users may harm our reputation impair our ability to retain existing customers or attract new customers and expose us to legal claims and government action each of which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and growth prospects Our international operations subject us to operational and financial risks We provide services within and between foreign countries on an increasing basis Our business outside of the United States is subject to various risks including  changes in tariffs trade restrictions trade agreements and taxations  difficulties in managing or overseeing foreign operations and agents  limitations on the repatriation of funds because of foreign exchange controls  different liability standards and  intellectual property laws of countries that do not protect our rights in our intellectual property including but not limited to our proprietary information systems to the same extent as the laws of the United States The occurrence or consequences of any of these factors may restrict our ability to operate in the affected region andor decrease the profitability of our operations in that region As we continue to expand our business internationally we expose the company to increased risk of loss from foreign currency fluctuations as well as longer accounts receivable payment cycles Foreign currency fluctuations could result in currency exchange gains or losses or could affect the book value of our assets and liabilities Furthermore we may experience unanticipated changes to our income tax liabilities resulting from changes in geographical income mix and changing international tax legislation We have limited control over these risks and if we do not correctly anticipate changes in international economic and political conditions we may not alter our business practices in time to avoid adverse effects Our ability to appropriately staff and retain employees is important to our variable cost model Our continued success depends upon our ability to attract and retain a large group of motivated salespeople and other logistics professionals In order to maintain high variability in our business model it is necessary to adjust staffing levels to changing market demands In periods of rapid change it is more difficult to match our staffing level to our business needs We cannot guarantee that we will be able to continue to hire and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel Because of our comprehensive employee training program our employees are attractive targets for new and existing competitors Continued success depends in large part on our ability to develop successful employees into managers Our operations may be materially adversely affected by inconsistent management practices We manage our business through a network of offices throughout North America Europe Asia Oceania and South America supported by executives and shared and centralized services with local management responsible for daytoday operations personnel decisions and adherence to applicable local laws Inconsistent management practices could materially and adversely affect our overall profitability and expose us to litigation We derive a significant portion of our total revenue and adjusted gross profit from our largest customers Our top 100 customers comprise approximately 28 percent of our consolidated total revenue and 20 percent of consolidated adjusted gross profit Our largest customer comprises approximately one percent of our consolidated total revenue The sudden loss of major customers could materially and adversely affect our operating results 16 Table of Content We may have difficulties integrating acquired companies For acquisitions success depends upon efficiently integrating the acquired business into our existing operations These risks could be heightened if we complete a large acquisition or multiple acquisitions within a short period of time We are required to integrate these businesses into our internal control environment which may present challenges that are different than those presented by organic growth and that may be difficult to manage If we are unable to successfully integrate and grow these acquisitions and to realize contemplated revenue synergies and cost savings our business prospects results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected Our growth and profitability may not continue which may result in a decrease in our stock price Our longterm growth objective is to grow earnings per share by 10 percent annually Longterm growth targets represent an over time perspective and do not necessarily represent an expected annual growth rate There can be no assurance that our longterm growth objective will be achieved or that we will be able to effectively adapt our management administrative and operational systems to respond to any future growth Future changes in and expansion of our business or changes in economic or political conditions could adversely affect our operating margins Slower or less profitable growth or losses could adversely affect our stock price Governmental regulatory and legal risk factors We are subject to claims arising from our transportation operations We use the services of thousands of transportation companies in connection with our transportation operations From time to time the drivers employed and engaged by the motor carriers we contract with are involved in accidents which may result in serious personal injuries The resulting types andor amounts of damages may be excluded by or exceed the amount of insurance coverage maintained by the contracted motor carrier We contractually require all motor carriers we work with to carry at least 750000 in automobile liability insurance We also require all contracted motor carriers to maintain workers compensation and other insurance coverage as required by law Most contracted motor carriers have insurance exceeding these minimum requirements as well as cargo insurance in varying policy amounts Railroads which are generally selfinsured provide limited common carrier cargo loss or damage liability protection generally up to 250000 per shipme nt Although these drivers are not our employees and all of these drivers are employees owneroperators or independent contractors working for motor carriers from time to time claims may be asserted against us for their actions or for our actions in retaining them Cl aims against us may exceed the amount of our insurance coverage or may not be covered by insurance at all In addition our automobile liability policy has a primary retention of 5 million per incident and also retention between 85 million and 90 million per incident A material increase in the frequency or severity of accidents liability claims or workers compensation claims or unfavorable resolutions of claims could materially and adversely affect our operating results In addition significant increases in insurance costs or the inability to purchase insurance as a result of these claims could reduce our profitability Our involvement in the transportation of certain goods including but not limited to hazardous materials could also increase our exposure in the event one of our contracted motor carriers is involved in an accident resulting in injuries or contamination In North America as a property freight broker we are not legally liable for loss or damage to our customers cargo In our customer contracts we may agree to assume cargo liability up to a stated maximum We typically do not assume cargo liability to our customers above minimum industry standards in our international freight forwarding ocean transportation or air freight businesses on international or domestic air shipments Although we are not legally liable for loss or damage to our customers cargo from time to time claims may be asserted against us for cargo losses We maintain a broad cargo liability insurance policy to help protect us against catastrophic losses that may not be recovered from the responsible contracted carrier We also carry various liability insurance policies including automobile and general liability with a 155 million umbrella where we carry retentions between 2 million and 5 million and 85 million and 90 million per incident Buying and reselling fresh produce exposes us to possible product liability Agricultural chemicals used on fresh produce are subject to various approvals and the commodities themselves are subject to regulations on cleanliness and contamination Product recalls in the produce industry have been caused by concern about particular chemicals and alleged contamination often leading to lawsuits brought by consumers of allegedly affected produce We may face claims for a variety of damages arising from the sale of produce which may include potentially uninsured consequential damages While we are insured for up to 155 million for product liability claims subject to a 500000 per incident deductible settlement of class action claims is often costly and we cannot guarantee that our coverage will be adequate and will continue to be available If we have to recall produce we may be required to bear the cost of repurchasing transporting and destroying any allegedly contaminated product as well as associated consequential damages We carry product recall and contamination insurance coverage of 30 million This policy has a retention of 35 million per incident Any recall or allegation of contamination could affect our reputation particularly of our proprietary andor licensed branded produce programs Loss due to spoilage including the need for disposal is also a routine part of the sourcing business Our business depends upon compliance with numerous government regulations Our operations may be regulated and licensed by various federal state and local transportation agencies in the United States and similar governmental agencies in foreign countries in which we operate 17 Table of Content We are subject to licensing and regulation as a property freight broker and are licensed by the DOT to arrange for the transportation of property by motor vehicle The DOT prescribes qualifications for acting in this capacity including certain surety bonding requirements We are also subject to regulation by the FMC as an ocean freight forwarder and a NVOCC and we maintain separate bonds and licenses for each We operate as a Department of Homeland Security certified IAC providing air freight services subject to commercial standards set forth by the IATA and federal regulations issued by the TSA We provide customs brokerage services as a customs broker under a license issued by the US Customs and Border Protection and other authoritative governmental agencies We also have and maintain other licenses as required by law We source fresh produce under a license issued by the USDA as required by PACA We are also subject to various regulations and requirements promulgated by other international domestic state and local agencies and port authorities Our failure to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to entities holding these licenses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition Legislative or regulatory changes can affect the economics of the transportation industry by requiring changes in operating practices or influencing the demand for and the cost of providing transportation services As part of our logistics services we operate owned or leased warehouse facilities Our operations at these facilities include both warehousing and distribution services and we are subject to various federal state and international environmental work safety and hazardous materials regulations We may experience an increase in operating costs such as security costs as a result of governmental regulations that have been and will be adopted in response to terrorist activities and potential terrorist activities No assurances can be given that we will be able to pass these increased costs on to our customers in the form of rate increases or surcharges and our operations and profitability may suffer as a result Department of Homeland Security regulations applicable to our customers who import goods into the United States and our contracted ocean carriers can impact our ability to provide andor receive services with and from these parties Enforcement measures related to violations of these regulations can slow andor prevent the delivery of shipments which may negatively impact our operations We cannot predict what impact future regulations may have on our business Our failure to maintain required permits or licenses or to comply with applicable regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of our operating permits and licenses Our contracted motor carriers are subject to increasingly stringent laws protecting the environment including those relating to climate change which could directly or indirectly have a material adverse effect on our business Future and existing environmental regulatory requirements in the US and abroad could adversely affect operations and increase operating expenses which in turn could increase our purchased transportation costs If we are unable to pass such costs along to our customers our business could be materially and adversely affected Even without any new legislation or regulation increased public concern regarding greenhouse gases emitted by transportation carriers could harm the reputations of companies operating in the transportation logistics industries and shift consumer demand toward more locally sourced products and away from our services Changes in the method for determining LIBOR and the potential replacement of the LIBOR benchmark interest rate could increase our borrowing costs We are also subject to risks related to uncertainty regarding LIBOR A portion of our borrowing capacity bears interest at variable interest rates primarily based on LIBOR As of December 31 2020 we had no LIBORbased borrowings outstanding LIBOR is the subject of recent national international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform and the use of LIBOR is expected to be discontinued after 2021 While we expect that reasonable alternatives to LIBOR will be implemented prior to its discontinuation or that the target date for discontinuation may be extended we cannot predict the consequences and timing of these developments and they could include an increase in our interest expense General risk factors We are subject to negative impacts of changes in political and governmental conditions Our operations are subject to the influences of significant political governmental and similar changes and our ability to respond to them including  changes in political conditions and in governmental policies  changes in and compliance with international and domestic laws and regulations and  wars civil unrest acts of terrorism and other conflicts 18 Table of Content We may be subject to negative impacts of catastrophic events  A disruption or failure of our systems or operations in the event of a major earthquake weather event cyberattack heightened security measures actual or threatened terrorist attack strike civil unrest pandemic or other catastrophic event could cause delays in providing services or performing other critical functions A catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information systems could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations and adversely impact our operating results In addition the company is monitoring the ongoing COVID19 pandemic which has already caused a significant disruption to global financial markets and supply chains and has resulted in increased travel restrictions and extended shutdown of certain businesses across the globe We have already experienced changes in demand including declines in certain industries and regions along with volatile pricing The significance of the operational and financial impact to our business will likely depend on how long and widespread this outbreak proves to be The extent to which COVID19 impacts our results will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of the outbreak and the international actions that are being taken to contain and treat it While we currently expect this business disruption to be temporary there is uncertainty around the duration and its broader impact on the economy and therefore the effects it will have on our operations and financial results If economic or market conditions in key global markets deteriorate further we expect to continue experiencing material adverse effects on our business and results of operations and may experience material adverse effects on our financial positions ITEM 1B UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None ITEM 2 PROPERTIES Our corporate headquarters is in Eden Prairie Minnesota The total square footage of our five buildings three of which we own in Eden Prairie is 400000 This total includes a data center of approximately 18000 square feet We also own an office in Kansas City Missouri of approximately 208000 square feet We lease approximately 280 locations used for office space in approximately 240 cities around the world most notably a fifteen year lease which commenced in August 2018 of approximately 207000 square feet in Chicago Illinois In addition we lease warehouse space totaling approximately 42 million square feet in 24 locations primarily within the United States and a data center in Oronoco Minnesota of approximately 32000 square feet Most of our offices and warehouses are leased from third parties under leases with initial terms ranging from three to fifteen years Our office locations range in space from 1000 to 208000 square feet Because we are a global enterprise characterized by substantial intersegment cooperation properties are often used by multiple business segments We continue to optimize our real estate footprint across the network as we expect flexible work arrangements to become more prominent postpandemic We consider our current office spaces and warehouse facilities adequate for our current level of operations We have not had difficulty in obtaining sufficient office space and believe we can renew existing leases or relocate to new offices as leases expire if necessary ITEM 3 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS We are not subject to any pending or threatened litigation other than routine litigation arising in the ordinary course of our business operations For some legal proceedings we have accrued an amount that reflects the aggregate liability deemed probable and estimable but this amount is not material to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows Because of the preliminary nature of many of these proceedings the difficulty in ascertaining the applicable facts relating to many of these proceedings the inconsistent treatment of claims made in many of these proceedings and the difficulty of predicting the settlement value of many of these proceedings we are not able to estimate an amount or range of any reasonably possible additional losses However based upon our historical experience the resolution of these proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows ITEM 4 MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES Not applicable 19 Table of Content PART II
