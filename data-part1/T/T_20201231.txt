converged services that combine technologies and services Our First Responder Network Authority FirstNet contract and our strong spectrum position allow us to execute a progressive 5G deployment strategy With our subscription video on demand streaming platform HBO Max we intend to capitalize on our premier network technology and distribution capabilities to provide our premier content in this highly attractive offering Our fiber expansion allows us to respond to continuing advances in technology and changing demands from our customers We expect our transition to softwarebased products with low acquisition costs will provide better economics and improve our product portfolio including expansion of streaming services Our acquisitions over the past few years and our continued investment in a premier network experience make our customers lives more convenient and productive and foster competition and further innovation in the communications and entertainment industry Communications Our integrated telecommunications network utilizes different technological platforms including wireless satellite and wireline to provide instant connectivity at the higher speeds made possible by our fiber network expansion and wireless network enhancements Video streaming is expected to drive greater demand for broadband and capitalize on our fiber deployment These investments have and should continue to prepare us to meet increased customer demand for enhanced wireless and broadband services including video streaming augmented reality and smart technologies During 2021 we will continue to develop and provide highvalue integrated mobile and broadband solutions We believe offering integrated services facilitates our customers desire to view content anywhere on demand and encourages customer retention Wireless Service We are experiencing rapid growth in data usage as consumers are demanding seamless access across their wireless and wired devices and businesses and municipalities are connecting more and more equipment and facilities to the internet We were awarded the FirstNet contract in 2018 which provided us with access to 20 MHz of nationwide low band spectrum and invested in 3739 GHz spectrum in a Federal Communications Commission FCC auction These bands facilitate our 5G services At December 31 2020 our FirstNet coverage is more than 80 percent complete with 19 million FirstNet connections Our 5G service went nationwide in July 2020 and with that availability we anticipate the introduction of 5G handsets and devices will contribute to a renewed interest in equipment upgrades We will continue to invest in our wireless network as we look to provide future service offerings and participate in emerging technologies such as 5G and millimeterwave bands The increased speeds and network operating efficiency expected with this technology should enable massive deployment of devices connected to the internet as well as faster delivery of data services We expect that 5G will enhance our customers entire connected experience and not just provide faster speeds Our network covers over 440 million people in North America with 4G LTE technology and in the United States our network covers all major metropolitan areas and more than 330 million people with our LTE technology Our 3G network provides services to customers using older handsets and connected devices We expect to redeploy spectrum currently used for our 3G services as we transition to 5G service and project that we will discontinue service on our 3G network in early 2022 we will manage this process consistent with previous network upgrades As of December 31 2020 about 5 percent of our postpaid subscribers were using 3G handsets and we expect them to transition to newer technologies We do not expect this transition to have a material impact on our consolidated operating results As the wireless industry has matured future wireless growth will increasingly depend on our ability to offer innovative data services on a wireless network that has sufficient spectrum and capacity to support these innovations We continue to invest significant capital in expanding our network capacity as well as obtaining additional spectrum that meets our longterm needs We participate in FCC spectrum auctions and have been redeploying spectrum previously used for more basic services to support more advanced mobile internet services Broadband Technology We are rapidly converting to a softwarebased network and managing the migration of wireline customers to services using our fiber infrastructure to provide broadband technology Softwarebased technologies align with our global leadership in software defined network SDN and network function virtualization NFV This network approach

GOVERNMENT REGULATION Wireless communications providers in the United States must be licensed by the FCC to provide communications services at specified spectrum frequencies within defined geographic areas and must comply with the rules and policies governing the use of the spectrum as adopted by the FCC The FCCs rules have a direct impact on whether the wireless industry has sufficient spectrum available to support the highquality innovative services our customers demand Wireless licenses are issued for a fixed time period typically ten years and we must seek renewal of these licenses While the FCC has generally renewed licenses given to operating companies such as us the FCC has authority to both revoke a license for cause and to deny a license renewal if a renewal is not in the public interest Additionally while wireless communications providers prices and service offerings are generally not subject to regulation the federal government and various states periodically consider new regulations and legislation relating to various aspects of wireless services 9 ATT Inc Dollars in millions except per share amounts The Communications Act of 1934 and other related acts give the FCC broad authority to regulate the US operations of our satellite services which are licensed by the FCC and some of WarnerMedias businesses are also subject to obligations under the Communications Act and related FCC regulations We continue to support regulatory and legislative measures and efforts at both the federal and state levels to minimize andor moderate regulatory burdens that are no longer appropriate in a competitive communications market and that inhibit our ability to compete more effectively and offer services wanted and needed by our customers including initiatives to transition services from traditional networks to all IPbased networks At the same time we also seek to ensure that legacy regulations are not further extended to broadband or wireless services which are subject to vigorous competition Our ILEC subsidiaries are subject to regulation by state governments which have the power to regulate intrastate rates and services including local longdistance and network access services provided such state regulation is consistent with federal law Some states have eliminated or reduced regulations on our retail offerings In addition many states have adopted legislation that enables us to provide IPbased video service through a single statewide or stateapproved franchise to offer a competitive video product These subsidiaries are also subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC with respect to intercarrier compensation interconnection and interstate and international rates and services including interstate access charges Access charges are a form of intercarrier compensation designed to reimburse our wireline subsidiaries for the use of their networks by other carriers Our subsidiaries operating outside the United States are subject to the jurisdiction of national and supranational regulatory authorities in the market where service is provided The following discussion highlights significant regulatory issues directly affecting our operations Communications Segment Wireless The industrywide deployment of 5G technology which is needed to satisfy extensive demand for video and internet access will involve significant deployment of small cell equipment and therefore increase the need for local permitting processes that allow for the placement of small cell equipment on reasonable timelines and terms Federal regulations also can delay and impede broadband services including small cell equipment In March August and September 2018 the FCC adopted orders to streamline the wireless infrastructure review process in order to facilitate deployment of nextgeneration wireless facilities Specifically the FCCs March 2018 Order streamlined historical tribal and environmental review requirements for wireless infrastructure including the exclusion of most small cell facilities from such review The Order was appealed and in August 2019 the DC Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the FCCs finding that most small cell facilities are excluded from review but otherwise upheld the FCCs Order The FCCs August and September 2018 Orders simplified the regulations for attaching telecommunications equipment to utility poles and clarified when local government rightofway access and use restrictions can be preempted because they unlawfully prohibit the provision of telecommunications services Those orders were appealed to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals which in August 2020 largely upheld the FCC Orders Those orders have been appealed and the various appeals remain pending in the DC Circuit and 9th Circuit Court of Appeals In addition to date 31 states and Puerto Rico have adopted legislation to facilitate small cell deployment Internet In February 2015 the FCC released an order classifying both fixed and mobile consumer broadband internet access services as telecommunications services subject to Title II of the Communications Act The Order which represented a departure from longstanding bipartisan precedent significantly expanded the FCCs authority to regulate broadband internet access services as well as internet interconnection arrangements In December 2017 the FCC reversed its 2015 decision by reclassifying fixed and mobile consumer broadband services as information services and repealing most of the rules that were adopted in 2015 In lieu of broad conduct prohibitions the order requires internet service providers to disclose information about their network practices and terms of service including whether they block or throttle internet traffic or offer paid prioritization On October 1 2019 the DC Circuit issued a unanimous opinion upholding the FCCs reclassification of broadband as an information service and its reliance on transparency requirements and competitive marketplace dynamics to safeguard net neutrality While the court vacated the FCCs express preemption of any state regulation of net neutrality it stressed that its ruling did not prevent the FCC or ISPs from relying on conflict preemption to invalidate particular state laws that are inconsistent with the FCCs regulatory objectives and framework The court also remanded the matter to the FCC for further consideration of the impact of reclassifying broadband services as information services on public safety the Lifeline program and pole attachment regulation In October 2020 the FCC adopted an order concluding that those issues did not justify reversing its decision to reclassify 10 ATT Inc Dollars in millions except per share amounts broadband services as information services An appeal of the FCCs remand decision is pending Following the FCCs 2017 decision to reclassify broadband as information services a number of states adopted legislation to reimpose the very rules the FCC repealed In some cases state legislation imposes requirements that go beyond the FCCs February 2015 order Additionally some state governors have issued executive orders that effectively reimpose the repealed requirements Suits have been filed concerning laws in California and Vermont Both lawsuits were stayed pursuant to agreements by those states not to enforce their laws pending final resolution of all appeals of the FCCs December 2017 order Because that order is now final the California suit has returned to active status Nonetheless enforcement of both the California and Vermont laws remain stayed pending a ruling by a US District Court in California on motions for a preliminary injunction against enforcement of the California law Argument on those motions is now scheduled for February 2021 We expect that going forward additional states may seek to impose net neutrality requirements We will continue to support congressional action to codify a set of standard consumer rules for the internet Privacyrelated legislation continues to be adopted or considered in a number of jurisdictions Legislative regulatory and litigation actions could result in significant penalties increased costs of compliance further regulation or claims against broadband internet access service providers and others and increased uncertainty in the value and availability of data WarnerMedia Segment WarnerMedia creates owns and distributes intellectual property including copyrights trademarks and licenses of intellectual property To protect its intellectual property WarnerMedia relies on a combination of laws and license agreements Outside the US laws and regulations relating to intellectual property protection and the effective enforcement of these laws and regulations vary greatly from country to country The European Union is pursuing legislative and regulatory initiatives which could impact WarnerMedias activities in the EU Piracy particularly of digital content continues to threaten revenues from WarnerMedias products and services as well as revenues from our pay TV business and we work to limit that threat through a combination of approaches including technological and legislative solutions Outside the US various laws and regulations as well as trade agreements with the US also apply to the distribution or licensing of feature films for exhibition in theaters and on broadcast and cable networks For example in certain countries including China laws and regulations limit the number of foreign films exhibited in such countries in a calendar year Additional information relating to regulation of our subsidiaries is contained under the headings Operating Environment Overview and Regulatory Developments of Item 7 IMPORTANCE DURATION AND EFFECT OF LICENSES Certain of our subsidiaries own or have licenses to various patents copyrights trademarks and other intellectual property necessary to conduct business Many of our subsidiaries also hold governmentissued licenses or franchises to provide wireline satellite or wireless services Additional information relating to regulation affecting those rights is contained under the heading Operating Environment Overview of Item 7 We actively pursue patents trademarks and service marks to protect our intellectual property within the United States and abroad We maintain a significant global portfolio of patents trademarks and service mark registrations We have also entered into agreements that permit other companies in exchange for fees and rights and subject to appropriate safeguards and restrictions to utilize certain of our patents trademarks and service marks As we transition our network from a switchbased network to an IP softwarebased network we have increasingly entered into licensing agreements with software developers We periodically receive offers from third parties to obtain licenses for patents and other intellectual rights in exchange for royalties or other payments We also receive notices asserting that our products or services sold to customers or softwarebased network functions infringe on their patents and other intellectual property rights These claims whether against us directly such as network functions or against thirdparty suppliers of products or services that we in turn sell to our customers such as wireless handsets could require us to pay damages royalties stop offering the relevant products or services andor cease network functions or other activities While the outcome of any litigation is uncertain we do not believe that the resolution of any of these infringement claims or the expiration or nonrenewal of any of our intellectual property rights would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 11 ATT Inc Dollars in millions except per share amounts MAJOR CUSTOMERS No customer accounted for 10 or more of our consolidated revenues in 2020 2019 or 2018 COMPETITION Competition continues to increase for communications media entertainment and digital services from traditional and nontraditional competitors Technological advances have expanded the types and uses of services and products available In addition lack of or a reduced level of regulation of comparable legacy services has lowered costs for alternative communications service providers As a result we face continuing competition as well as some new opportunities in significant portions of our business Wireless We face substantial competition in our wireless businesses Under current FCC rules multiple licensees who provide wireless services on the cellular PCS Advanced Wireless Services 700 MHz and other spectrum bands may operate in each of our US service areas Our competitors include two national wireless providers a larger number of regional providers and resellers of those services and certain cable companies In addition we face competition from providers who offer voice text messaging and other services as applications on data networks We are one of four facilitiesbased providers in Mexico retail and wholesale with the most significant market share controlled by Amrica Mvil We may experience significant competition from companies that provide similar services using other communications technologies and services While some of these technologies and services are now operational others are being developed or may be developed We compete for customers based principally on servicedevice offerings price network quality coverage area and customer service VideoBroadband Our businesses providing communications and digital entertainment services will face continued competitive pressure in 2021 from multiple providers including wireless satellite cable online video providers and resellers In addition the desire for highspeed data on demand including video is continuing to lead customers to terminate their traditional wired or linear services and use our or competitors wireless satellite and internetbased services We have launched our own video OTT andor streaming options to attract or retain customers that do not want a fullscale traditional video package In most US markets we compete for customers with large cable companies for highspeed internet video and voice services and other smaller telecommunications companies for both longdistance and local services In addition in Latin American countries served by our Vrio subsidiary we also face competition from other video providers including Amrica Mvil and Telefnica Legacy Voice and Data We continue to lose legacy voice and data subscribers due to competitors eg wireless cable and VoIP providers who can provide comparable services at lower prices because they are not subject to traditional telephone industry regulation or the extent of regulation they are subject to is in dispute utilize different technologies or promote a different business model such as advertisingbased In response to these competitive pressures for a number of years we have used a bundling strategy that rewards customers who consolidate their services with us We continue to focus on bundling services including combined packages of wireless and video service through our IPbased services We will continue to develop innovative and integrated services that capitalize on our wireless and IPbased network Additionally we provide local and interstate telephone and switched services to other service providers primarily large internet service providers using the largest class of nationwide internet networks internet backbone wireless carriers other telephone companies cable companies and systems integrators These services are subject to additional competitive pressures from the development of new technologies the introduction of innovative offerings and increasing satellite wireless fiberoptic and cable transmission capacity for services We face a number of international competitors including Orange Business Services BT Singapore Telecommunications Limited and Verizon Communications Inc as well as competition from a number of large systems integrators Media Our WarnerMedia businesses face shifts in consumer viewing patterns increased competition from streaming services and the expansion by other companies in particular technology companies In May 2020 we launched HBO Max our platform for premium content and video offered directly to consumers as well as through our traditional distributors 12 ATT Inc Dollars in millions except per share amounts WarnerMedia competes with other studios and television production groups and independents to produce and sell programming Many television networks and online platforms have affiliated production companies from which they are increasingly obtaining their programming which has reduced their demand for programming from nonaffiliated production companies WarnerMedia also faces competition from other television networks online platforms and premium pay television services for distribution and marketing of its television networks and premium pay and basic tier television services by affiliates Our WarnerMedia businesses compete with other production companies and studios for the services of producers directors writers actors and others and for the acquisition of literary properties In recent years technology companies also have begun to produce programming and compete with WarnerMedia for talent and property rights Advertising The increased amount of consumer time spent online and on mobile activities has resulted in the shift of advertising budgets away from traditional television to digital advertising WarnerMedias advertisingsupported television networks and digital properties compete with streaming services other networks and digital properties print radio and other media Our programmatic advertising business faces competition from a variety of technology companies Similar to all participants in the advertising technology sector we contend with the dominance of Google as well as the influence of Facebook whose practices may result in the decreased ability and willingness of advertisers and programmers to adopt programmatic solutions offered by alternative suppliers RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ATT scientists and engineers conduct research in a variety of areas including IP networking advanced network design and architecture network and cyber security network operations support systems satellite technology video platform development and data analytics The majority of the development activities are performed to create new services and to invent tools and systems to manage secure and reliable networks for us and our customers Research and development expenses were 1210 in 2020 1276 in 2019 and 1194 in 2018 HUMAN CAPITAL

skills they need to thrive We offer training and elective courses that give employees the opportunity to enhance their skills We also intend to help cultivate the next generation of talent that will lead our company into the future by providing employees with educational opportunities through our awardwinning internal training organization ATT University Labor Contracts Approximately 37 of our employees are represented by the Communications Workers of America CWA the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers IBEW or other unions After expiration of the collective bargaining agreements work stoppages or labor disruptions may occur in the absence of new contracts or other agreements being reached There are no significant contracts expiring in 2021 A contract covering approximately 14000 Mobility employees in 36 states and the District of Columbia that was set to expire in February 2021 was extended until February 2022 A contract covering approximately 10000 Mobility employees in nine Southeast states that was set to expire in February 2022 was extended until February 2023 Compensation and Benefits In addition to salaries we provide a variety of benefit programs to help meet the needs of our employees These programs cover active and former employees and may vary by subsidiary and region These programs include 401k plans pension benefits and health and welfare benefits among many others In addition to our active employee base at December 31 2020 we had approximately 517000 retirees and dependents that were eligible to receive retiree benefits We review our benefit plans to maintain competitive packages that reflect the needs of our workforce We also adapt our compensation model to provide fair and inclusive pay practices across our business We are committed to pay equity for employees who hold the same jobs work in the same geographic area and have the same levels of experience and performance 13 ATT Inc Dollars in millions except per share

color LGBTQ individuals people with disabilities and veterans but also around professionals who are experienced or interested in cybersecurity engineering innovation project management and media and entertainment technology When everyones unique story is celebrated we are able to connect create and innovate in real and meaningful ways It is important that our employees feel valued have a sense of belonging and are fully engaged in our success ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS In addition to the other information set forth in this document including the matters contained under the caption Cautionary Language Concerning ForwardLooking Statements you should carefully read the matters described below We believe that each of these matters could materially affect our business We recognize that most of these factors are beyond our ability to control and therefore we cannot predict an outcome Macroeconomic Factors Adverse changes in the US securities markets interest rates and medical costs could materially increase our benefit plan costs and future funding requirements Our costs to provide current benefits and funding for future benefits are subject to increases primarily due to continuing increases in medical and prescription drug costs and can be affected by lower returns on assets held by our pension and other benefit plans which are reflected in our financial statements for that year In calculating the costs included on our financial statements of providing benefits under our plans we have made certain assumptions regarding future investment returns interest rates and medical costs These assumptions could change significantly over time and could be materially different than originally projected Lower than assumed investment returns a decline in interest rates with a corresponding increase in our benefit obligations and higher than assumed medical and prescription drug costs will increase expenses The Financial Accounting Standards Board requires companies to recognize the funded status of defined benefit pension and postretirement plans as an asset or liability in their statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur We have elected to reflect the annual adjustments to the funded status in our consolidated statement of income Therefore an increase in our costs or adverse market conditions will have a negative effect on our operating results Significant adverse changes in capital markets could result in the deterioration of our defined benefit plans funded status and result in increased contribution requirements for such plans which could be material 14 ATT Inc Dollars in millions except per share amounts Adverse changes in global financial markets could limit our ability and our larger customers ability to access capital or increase the cost of capital needed to fund business operations During 2020 uncertainty surrounding global growth rates and the impact of the COVID19 pandemic helped create volatility in the credit currency equity and fixed income markets Volatility may affect companies access to the credit markets leading to higher borrowing costs or in some cases the inability to fund ongoing operations In addition we contract with large financial institutions to support our own treasury operations including contracts to hedge our exposure on interest rates and foreign exchange and the funding of credit lines and other shortterm debt obligations including commercial paper These financial institutions face stricter capitalrelated and other regulations in the United States and Europe as well as ongoing legal and financial issues concerning their loan portfolios which may hamper their ability to provide credit or raise the cost of providing such credit The UK Financial Conduct Authority which regulates LIBOR has announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021 Although our securities may provide for alternative methods of calculating the interest rate payable on such indebtedness uncertainty as to the extent and manner of future changes may adversely affect the current trading market for LIBORbased securities and the value of variable rate indebtedness in general A companys cost of borrowing is also affected by evaluations given by various credit rating agencies and these agencies have been applying tighter credit standards when evaluating debt levels and future growth prospects While we have been successful in continuing to access the credit and fixed income markets when needed adverse changes in the financial markets could render us either unable to access these markets or able to access these markets only at higher interest costs and with restrictive financial or other conditions severely affecting our business operations Additionally downgrades of our credit rating by the major credit rating agencies could increase our cost of borrowing and also impact the collateral we would be required to post under certain agreements we have entered into with our derivative counterparties which could negatively impact our liquidity Further valuation changes in our derivative portfolio due to interest rates and foreign exchange rates could require us to post collateral and thus may negatively impact our liquidity Our international operations have increased our exposure to political instability to changes in the international economy and to the level of regulation on our business and these risks could offset our expected growth opportunities We have international operations particularly in Latin America including Mexico and worldwide through WarnerMedias content distribution We need to comply with a wide variety of complex local laws regulations and treaties We are exposed to restrictions on cash repatriation foreign exchange controls fluctuations in currency values changes in relationships between US and foreign governments trade restrictions including potential tariffs differences in intellectual property protection laws and other regulations that may affect materially our earnings Our Mexico operations in particular rely on a continuation of a regulatory regime that fosters competition While our foreign operations represent significant opportunities to sell our services a number of foreign countries where we operate have experienced unstable growth patterns increased inflation currency devaluation foreign exchange controls instability in the banking sector and high unemployment In addition significant political turmoil has continued in several Latin American countries Should these conditions persist our ability to offer service in one or more countries could be adversely affected and customers in these countries may be unable to purchase the services we offer or pay for services already provided For example we found it necessary in May 2020 to close our DIRECTV operations in Venezuela due to political instability in the country and in order to comply with sanctions of the US government In addition operating in foreign countries also typically involves participating with local businesses either to comply with local laws or for example to enhance product marketing deploy networks or execute on other capital projects Involvement with foreign firms exposes us to the risk of being unable to control the actions of those firms and therefore exposes us to risks associated with our obligation to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act FCPA Violations of the FCPA could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 15 ATT Inc Dollars in millions except per share amounts Industrywide Factors Our business is subject to risks arising from the outbreak of the COVID19 virus The COVID19 pandemic and resulting mitigation measures have caused and may continue to cause a negative effect on our operating results To date mitigation measures have caused sports leagues to modify their seasons and suspend certain operations as the cancellation of many sporting events including the 2020 NCAA tournament which has adversely affected our advertising revenues may result in contract disputes concerning carriage rights and has caused us to incur expenses relating to certain of these sporting events notwithstanding their cancellation The closure or avoidance of theaters and the interruptions in movie production and other programming caused by COVID19 are expected to continue to impact the timing of revenues and may cause a loss of revenue to our WarnerMedia business over the long term The COVID19 pandemic could also drive higher costs for our WarnerMedia business in 2021 based on the hybrid distribution model for releasing films in 2021 and costs associated with safety measures put in place to help provide a safe environment for content production If the mitigation measures or the associated effects are prolonged we expect business customers in industries most significantly impacted will continue to reduce or terminate services having a negative effect on the performance of our Business Wireline business unit Further concerns over the COVID19 pandemic could again result in the prolonged closure of many of our retail stores and deter customers from accessing our stores even as the pandemic subsides These pandemic concerns may also result in continued impact to our customers ability to pay for our products and services We may also continue to see significant impact on roaming revenues due to a downturn in international travel The COVID19 pandemic has caused and could further cause reduced staffing levels at our call centers and field operations resulting in delays in service Further reductions in staffing levels could additionally limit our ability to provide services adversely impacting our competitive position We may also incur significantly higher expenses attributable to infrastructure investments required to meet higher network utilization from more customers consuming bandwidth from changes in work from home trends extended cancellation periods and increased labor costs if the COVID19 pandemic continues for an extended period The COVID19 pandemic and mitigation measures have caused and may continue to cause adverse impacts on global economic conditions and consumer confidence spending and consumer behavior which could affect demand for our products and services The extent to which the COVID19 pandemic impacts our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including new information that may emerge concerning other strains of the virus and the actions to contain its impact Due to the speed with which the situation continues to develop and change we are not able at this time to estimate the additional impact of COVID19 on our financial or operational results but the impact could be material Changes to federal state and foreign government regulations and decisions in regulatory proceedings as well as private litigation could further increase our operating costs andor alter customer perceptions of our operations which could materially adversely affect us Our subsidiaries providing wired services are subject to significant federal and state regulation while many of our competitors are not In addition our subsidiaries and affiliates operating outside the United States are also subject to the jurisdiction of national and supranational regulatory authorities in the market where service is provided Our wireless and various video subsidiaries are regulated to varying degrees by the FCC and in some instances by state and local agencies Adverse regulations and rulings by the FCC relating to broadband wireless deployment and satellite video issues could impede our ability to manage our networks and recover costs and lessen incentives to invest in our networks The continuing growth of IPbased services especially when accessed by wireless devices has created or potentially could create conflicting regulation between the FCC and various state and local authorities which may involve lengthy litigation to resolve and may result in outcomes unfavorable to us In addition increased public focus on a variety of issues related to our operations such as privacy issues government requests or orders for customer data and concerns about global climate changes have led to proposals or new legislation at state federal and foreign government levels to change or increase regulation on our operations Enactment of new privacy laws and regulations could among other things adversely affect our ability to collect and offer targeted advertisements or result in additional costs of compliance or litigation Should customers decide that our competitors offer a more customerfriendly environment our competitive position results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 16 ATT Inc Dollars in millions except per share amounts Continuing growth in and the converging nature of wireless video and broadband services will require us to deploy significant amounts of capital and require ongoing access to spectrum in order to provide attractive services to customers Wireless video and broadband services are undergoing rapid and significant technological changes and a dramatic increase in usage in particular the demand for faster and seamless usage of video and data across mobile and fixed devices The COVID19 pandemic has accelerated these changes and also resulted in higher network utilization as more customers consume bandwidth from changes in work from home trends We must continually invest in our networks in order to improve our wireless video and broadband services to meet this increasing demand and changes in customer expectations while remaining competitive Improvements in these services depend on many factors including continued access to and deployment of adequate spectrum and the capital needed to expand our wireline network to support transport of these services In order to stem broadband subscriber losses to cable competitors in our nonfiber wireline areas we have been expanding our allfiber wireline network We must maintain and expand our network capacity and coverage for transport of video data and voice between cell and fixed landline sites To this end we participate in spectrum auctions and continue to deploy software and other technology advancements in order to efficiently invest in our network Network service enhancements and product launches may not occur as scheduled or at the cost expected due to many factors including delays in determining equipment and wireless handset operating standards supplier delays software issues increases in network and handset component costs regulatory permitting delays for tower sites or enhancements or laborrelated delays Deployment of new technology also may adversely affect the performance of the network for existing services If we cannot acquire needed spectrum or deploy the services customers desire on a timely basis with acceptable quality and at reasonable costs then our ability to attract and retain customers and therefore maintain and improve our operating margins could be materially adversely affected Increasing competition for wireless customers could materially adversely affect our operating results We have multiple wireless competitors in each of our service areas and compete for customers based principally on servicedevice offerings price network quality coverage area and customer service In addition we are facing growing competition from providers offering services using advanced wireless technologies and IPbased networks We expect market saturation to continue to cause the wireless industrys customer growth rate to moderate in comparison with historical growth rates leading to increased competition for customers Our share of industry sales could be reduced due to aggressive pricing strategies pursued by competitors We also expect that our customers growing demand for highspeed video and data services will place constraints on our network capacity These competition and capacity constraints will continue to put pressure on pricing and margins as companies compete for potential customers Our ability to respond will depend among other things on continued improvement in network quality and customer service and our ability to price our products and services competitively as well as effective marketing of attractive products and services These efforts will involve significant expenses and require strategic management decisions on and timely implementation of equipment choices network deployment and service offerings Ongoing changes in the television industry and consumer viewing patterns could materially adversely affect our operating results Our video subsidiaries derive substantial revenues and profits from cable networks and premium pay television services and the production and licensing of television programming to broadcast and cable networks and premium pay television services The US television industry is continuing to evolve rapidly with developments in technology leading to new methods for the distribution of video content and changes in when where and how audiences consume video content These changes have led to 1 internetbased streaming competitors which are increasing in number and some of which have significant and growing subscriberuser bases and 2 reduced viewers of traditional advertisingsupported television resulting from increased video consumption through SVOD services including our own timeshifted viewing of television programming and the use of DVRs to skip advertisements The number of subscribers to traditional linear programming in the US has been declining in recent years and the US television industry has generally experienced declines in ratings for programming which have negatively affected subscription and advertising revenues and these trends are expected to continue The popularity of content whether on television on the internet or through movies is difficult to predict and can change rapidly and low public acceptance of our television OTT and movie content including WarnerMedias content could adversely affect our results of operations We are taking steps to mitigate the risks from these changes such as the launch of our HBO Max directtoconsumer streaming platform and new enhanced advertising opportunities but there can be no assurance that these and other efforts will be successful in responding to these changes 17 ATT Inc Dollars in millions except per share amounts Intellectual property rights may be adversely affected by piracy or be inadequate to take advantage of business opportunities such as new distribution platforms which may materially adversely affect our operations Increased piracy of video content products and other intellectual property particularly in our foreign WarnerMedia and Latin American operations will decrease revenues Mobile and broadband technological developments have made it easier to reproduce and distribute highquality unauthorized copies of content Piracy is particularly prevalent in countries that lack effective copyright and other legal protections or enforcement measures and thieves can attract users throughout the world Effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country where we operate We may need to spend significant amounts of money to protect our rights We are also increasingly negotiating broader licensing agreements to expand our ability to use new methods to distribute content to customers Any impairment of our intellectual property rights including due to changes in US or foreign intellectual property laws or the absence of effective legal protections or enforcement measures or our inability to negotiate broader distribution rights could materially adversely impact our operations Incidents leading to damage to our reputation and any resulting lawsuits claims or other legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business We believe that our brand image awareness and reputation strengthen our relationship with consumers and contribute significantly to the success of our business We strive to create a culture in which our colleagues act with integrity and respect and feel comfortable speaking up to report instances of misconduct or other concerns Our ability to attract and retain employees is highly dependent upon our commitment to a diverse and inclusive workplace ethical business practices and other qualities Acts of misconduct by any employee and particularly by senior management could erode trust and confidence and damage our reputation Negative public opinion could result from actual or alleged conduct by us or those currently or formerly associated with us and from any number of activities or circumstances including operations employmentrelated offenses such as sexual harassment and discrimination regulatory compliance and actions taken by regulators or others in response to such conduct We have in the past been and may in the future be named as a defendant in lawsuits claims and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business based on alleged acts of misconduct by employees These actions seek among other things compensation for alleged personal injury including claims for loss of life workers compensation employment discrimination sexual harassment workplace misconduct wage and hour claims and other employmentrelated damages compensation for breach of contract statutory or regulatory claims negligence or gross negligence punitive damages consequential damages and civil penalties or other losses or injunctive or declaratory relief The outcome of any allegations lawsuits claims or legal proceedings is inherently uncertain and could result in significant costs damage to our brands or reputation and diversion of managements attention from our business Additionally our news organization makes editorial judgments around what is covered and how it is covered in the normal course of business Although we have disciplined practices that are used to make such editorial judgments it is possible that our news coverage alienates some consumers adversely impacts our reputation and therefore impacts demand for our other products and services Any damage to our reputation or payments of significant amounts even if reserved could materially and adversely affect our business reputation financial condition results of operations and cash flows CompanySpecific Financial Factors Adoption of new softwarebased technologies may involve quality and supply chain issues and could increase capital costs The communications and digital entertainment industry has experienced rapid changes in the past several years An increasing number of our customers are using mobile devices as the primary means of viewing video and an increasing number of nontraditional video providers are developing content and technologies to satisfy the desire for video entertainment demand In addition businesses and government bodies are broadly shifting to wirelessbased services for homes and infrastructure to improve services to their respective customers and constituencies We are spending significant capital to shift our wired network to softwarebased technology to manage this demand and are expanding 5G wireless technology to address these consumer demands We are entering into a significant number of software licensing agreements and working with software developers to provide network functions in lieu of installing switches or other physical network equipment in order to respond to rapid developments in video and wireless demand While softwarebased functionality can be changed much more quickly than for example physical switches the rapid pace of development means that we may increasingly need to rely on singlesource and software solutions that have not previously been deployed in production environments Should this software not function as intended or our license agreements provide inadequate protection from intellectual property infringement claims we could be forced to either substitute if available or else spend time to develop alternative technologies at a much higher cost and incur harm to our reputation for reliability and as a result our ability to remain competitive could be materially adversely affected 18 ATT Inc Dollars in millions except per share amounts We depend on various suppliers to provide equipment to operate our business and satisfy customer demand and interruption or delay in supply can adversely impact our operating results We depend on suppliers to provide us directly or through other suppliers with items such as network equipment customer premises equipment video equipment and wirelessrelated equipment such as mobile hotspots handsets wirelessly enabled computers wireless data cards and other connected devices for our customers These suppliers could fail to provide equipment on a timely basis or fail to meet our performance expectations for a number of reasons including difficulties in obtaining export licenses for certain technologies inability to secure component parts general business disruption natural disasters safety issues economic and political instability and public health emergencies such as the COVID19 pandemic The COVID19 pandemic has caused and may again cause delays in the development manufacturing including the sourcing of key components and shipment of products In certain limited circumstances suppliers have been unable to supply products in a timely fashion In such limited circumstances we have been unable to provide products and services precisely as and when requested by our customers It is possible that in some circumstances we could be forced to switch to a different key supplier Because of the cost and time lag that can be associated with transitioning from one supplier to another our business could be substantially disrupted if we were required to or chose to replace the products of one or more key suppliers with products from another source especially if the replacement became necessary on short notice Any such disruption could increase our costs decrease our operating efficiencies and have a negative effect on our operating results Increasing costs to provide video and other services could adversely affect operating margins Our operating costs including customer acquisition and retention costs could continue to put pressure on margins and customer retention levels In addition most of our video programming that we distribute via our linear services is provided by other companies and historically the rates they charge us for programming have often increased more than the rate of inflation In addition as customer viewing habits shift to mobile ondemand and streaming from linear programming negotiating licensing rights is increasingly complicated We are attempting to use our scale and access to wireless customers to change this trend but such negotiations are difficult and also may result in programming disruption Our HBO Max streaming platform is another component of our strategy to reach nontraditional video customers and we are investing heavily to provide a competitive and attractive offering If we are unable to restrain these costs or provide programming desired by our customers it could impact margins and our ability to attract and retain customers Our WarnerMedia operations which create and license content to other providers also may experience increasing difficulties securing favorable terms including those related to pricing positioning and packaging during contract negotiations which may lead to blackouts of WarnerMedia programming and WarnerMedia may face greater difficulty in achieving placement of its networks and premium pay television services in offerings by third parties A number of our competitors offering comparable legacy services that rely on alternative technologies and business models are typically subject to less or no regulation and therefore are able to operate with lower costs These competitors generally can focus on discrete customer segments since they do not have regulatory obligations to provide universal service Also these competitors have cost advantages compared to us due in part to operating on newer more technically advanced and lowercost networks and a nonunionized workforce lower employee benefits and fewer retirees We are transitioning services from our old copperbased network and seeking regulatory approvals where needed at both the state and federal levels If we do not obtain regulatory approvals for our network transition or obtain approvals with onerous conditions we could experience significant cost and competitive disadvantages We may not realize or sustain the expected benefits from our business transformation initiatives and these efforts could have a materially adverse effect on our business operations financial condition results of operations and competitive position We have been and will be undertaking certain transformation initiatives which are designed to reduce costs streamline distribution remove redundancies and simplify and improve processes and support functions Our focus is on supporting added customer value with an improved customer experience We intend for these efficiencies to enable increased investments in our strategic areas of focus which consist of improving broadband connectivity for example fiber and 5G developing softwarebased entertainment such as HBO Max and ATT TV and utilizing WarnerMedias storytelling legacy to engage consumers and gain insights across multiple distribution points If we do not successfully manage and execute these initiatives or if they are inadequate or ineffective we may fail to meet our financial goals and achieve anticipated benefits improvements may be delayed not sustained or not realized and our business operations and competitive position could be adversely affected 19 ATT Inc Dollars in millions except per share amounts If our efforts to attract and retain subscribers to our new HBO Max platform are not successful our business will be adversely affected HBO Maxs future success is subject to inherent uncertainty Our ability to continue to attract subscribers to the HBO Max platform will depend in part on our ability to consistently provide subscribers with compelling content choices as well as a quality experience for selecting and viewing those content choices Furthermore the relative service levels content offerings promotions and pricing and related features of competitors to HBO Max may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain subscribers If consumers do not perceive our offerings to be of value including if we introduce new or adjust existing features adjust pricing or offerings terminate or modify promotional or trial period offerings experience technical issues or change the mix of content in a manner that is not favorably received by them we may not be able to attract and retain subscribers In addition many subscribers to these types of offerings originate from wordofmouth advertising from then existing subscribers If our efforts to satisfy subscribers are not successful including because we terminate or modify promotional or trialperiod offerings or because of technical issues with the platform we may not be able to attract or retain subscribers and as a result our ability to maintain andor grow our business will be adversely affected If subscribers cancel or decide to not continue subscriptions for any reason including a perception that they do not use it sufficiently the need to cut household expenses unsatisfactory availability of content promotions or trialperiod offers expire or are modified competitive services or promotions provide a better value or experience and customer service or technical issues are not satisfactorily resolved our business will be adversely affected We must continually add new subscribers both to replace canceled subscribers and to grow our business If we do not grow as expected given in particular that a significant portion of our content costs are committed and contracted over several years based on minimum subscriber delivery levels we may not be able to adjust our expenditures or increase our per subscriber revenues commensurate with the lowered growth rate such that our margins liquidity and results of operations may be adversely impacted If we are unable to successfully compete with competitors in retaining and attracting new subscribers our business will be adversely affected Further if excessive numbers of subscribers do cancel we may be required to incur significantly higher marketing expenditures or offer significantly more generous promotions to replace these subscribers with new subscribers Unfavorable litigation or governmental investigation results could require us to pay significant amounts or lead to onerous operating procedures We are subject to a number of lawsuits both in the United States and in foreign countries including at any particular time claims relating to antitrust patent infringement wage and hour personal injury customer privacy violations regulatory proceedings and selling and collection practices We also spend substantial resources complying with various government standards which may entail related investigations and litigation In the wireless area we also face current and potential litigation relating to alleged adverse health effects on customers or employees who use such technologies including for example wireless devices We may incur significant expenses defending such suits or government charges and may be required to pay amounts or otherwise change our

Business WT Offshore Inc is an independent oil and natural gas producer active in the exploration development and acquisition of oil and natural gas properties in the Gulf of Mexico WT Offshore Inc is a Texas corporation originally organized as a Nevada corporation in 1988 and successor by merger to WT Oil Properties Inc a Louisiana corporation organized in 1983 Since our founding in 1983 by our Chairman and CEO Tracy Krohn we have continually grown our footprint in the Gulf of Mexico through acquisitions exploration and development We currently hold working interests in 43 offshore producing fields in federal and state waters Our acreage well production and reserves information is described in more detail under Part I Item 2 Properties in this Form 10K Our working interests in fields leases structures and equipment are primarily owned by WT Offshore Inc and our whollyowned subsidiary WT Energy VI LLC a Delaware limited liability company and through our proportionately consolidated interest in Monza Energy LLC Monza as described in more detail in Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  Note 4  Joint Venture Drilling Program under Part II Item 8 in this Form 10K We have developed significant technical expertise in finding and developing properties in the Gulf of Mexico with production rates which provide the best opportunity to achieve a rapid return on our invested capital We have leveraged our experience in the conventional shelf to develop higher impact capital projects in the Gulf of Mexico in both the deepwater and the deep shelf We have acquired rights to explore and develop new prospects and existing oil and natural gas properties in both the deepwater and the deep shelf while at the same time continuing our focus on the conventional shelf Our drilling efforts in recent years have included the deepwater of the Gulf of Mexico Business Strategy Our goal is to pursue high rate of return projects and develop oil and natural gas resources that allow us to grow our production reserves and cash flow in a capital efficient manner thus enhancing the value of our assets We intend to execute the following elements of our business strategy in order to achieve this goal  Exploiting existing and acquired properties to add additional reserves and production  Exploring for reserves on our extensive acreage holdings and in other areas of the Gulf of Mexico  Acquiring reserves with substantial upside potential and additional leasehold acreage complementary to our existing acreage position at attractive prices and  Continuing to manage our balance sheet in a prudent manner and continuing our track record of financial flexibility in any commodity price environment Our focus is on making profitable investments while operating within cash flow maintaining sufficient liquidity cost reductions and fulfilling our contractual legal and financial obligations Over time we expect to delever through free cash flow generated by our producing asset base capital discipline organic growth and acquisitions We continue to closely monitor current and forecasted commodity prices to assess if changes are needed to our plans Market Trends In managing our business we are focused on optimizing production and increasing reserves in a profitable and prudent manner while managing cash flows to meet our obligations and investment needs Our cash flows are materially impacted by the prices of commodities we produce crude oil natural gas and the natural gas liquids NGLs extracted from natural gas In addition the prices of goods and services used in our business can vary and impact our cash flows 1 COVID19 Impacts on Economic Environment Due to circumstances related to the outbreak of COVID19 various measures have been taken by federal state and local governments to reduce the rate of spread of COVID19 These measures and other factors have resulted in a decrease of general economic activity and a corresponding decrease in global and domestic energy demand impacting commodity pricing In addition actions by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other high oil exporting countries like Russia OPEC negatively impacted crude oil prices during early 2020 These rapid and unprecedented events pushed crude oil storage near capacity and drove prices down significantly in the second quarter of 2020 These events were the primary cause of the significant supplyanddemand imbalance for oil significantly lowering oil pricing in 2020 compared to the prior year Throughout the United States during 2020 COVID19 outbreaks continued and in some areas increased Should these conditions continue in future periods they could constrain our ability to store and move production to downstream markets delay or curtail development activity or temporarily shutin production any or all of which could further reduce our cash flow Hurricanes Impact on our Production Beginning in the second quarter of 2020 and extending through October 2020 the Gulf of Mexico experienced numerous hurricanes and tropical storms that required us to shutin production at times due to their impact We have since returned substantially all wells to production that were shutin due to the hurricanes and tropical storms as have operators of properties in which we have an interest While no major structural damage occurred we incurred 47 million in repairs costs during 2020 associated with repairs to our assets caused by storm events in 2020 See  Risk Factors  the geographic concentration of our properties in the Gulf of Mexico subjects us to an increased risk of loss of revenues or curtailment of production from factors specifically affecting the Gulf of Mexico  During 2020 average realized commodity prices decreased from those we experienced during 2019 Our margins in 2020 decreased from 2019 primarily due to lower average realized commodity prices partially offset by lower operating expenses as a result of our costcutting efforts in 2020 We measure margins using net income loss before net interest expense income tax benefit expense depreciation depletion amortization and accretion unrealized commodity derivative gain or loss amortization of derivative premiums bad debt reserve gain on debt transaction litigation and other Adjusted EBITDA as a percent of revenue which is a not a financial measurement under generally accepted accounting principles GAAP Our production increased 38  in 2020 from the prior year Our proved reserves decreased by 130 million barrels of oil equivalent MMBoe in 2020 primarily due to the significant decline in commodity prices in 2020 as compared to 2019 MMBoe was computed on an equivalency ratio as described above During 2020 we drilled one well which we expect to complete in 2021 We continue to closely monitor current and forecasted commodity prices to assess what changes if any should be made to our 2021 plans See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Liquidity and Capital Resources under Part II Item 7 in this Form 10K for additional information Competition The oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive We also face increasing indirect competition from alternative energy sources including wind solar and electric power We currently operate in the Gulf of Mexico and compete for the acquisition of oil and natural gas properties and lease sales primarily on the basis of price for such properties We compete with numerous entities including major domestic and foreign oil companies other independent oil and natural gas companies and individual producers and operators Many of these competitors are large well established companies that have financial and other resources substantially greater than ours and greater ability to provide the extensive regulatory financial assurances required for offshore properties Our ability to acquire additional oil and natural gas properties acquire additional leases and to discover reserves in the future will depend upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties finance investments and consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment Oil and Natural Gas Marketing and Delivery Commitments We sell our crude oil NGLs and natural gas to thirdparty customers We are not dependent upon or contractually limited to any one customer or small group of customers However in 2020 approximately 39 of our revenues were received from BP Products North America 13 to Williams Field Services and 10 to Mercuria Energy America Inc Trading US Co with no other customer comprising greater than 10 of our 2020 revenues Given the commoditized nature of the products we produce and market and the location of our production in the Gulf of Mexico we believe the loss of any of the customers above would not result in a material adverse effect on our ability to market future oil and natural gas as replacement customers could be obtained in a relatively short period of time on terms conditions and pricing substantially similar to those currently existing We do not have any agreements which obligate us to deliver a fixed volumes of physical products to customers 2 Compliance with Government Regulations General Various aspects of our oil and natural gas operations are subject to extensive and continually changing regulations as legislation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion Numerous departments and agencies both federal and state are authorized by statute to issue and have issued rules and regulations binding upon the oil and natural gas industry and its individual members The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management BOEM and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement BSEE both agencies under the US Department of the Interior DOI have adopted regulations pursuant to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act OCSLA that apply to our operations on federal leases in the Gulf of Mexico The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC regulates the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce pursuant to the Natural Gas Act of 1938 NGA and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 NGPA In 1989 Congress enacted the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act which removed all remaining price and nonprice controls affecting wellhead sales of natural gas effective January 1 1993 Sales by producers of natural gas and all sales of crude oil condensate and NGLs can currently be made at uncontrolled market prices The FERC also regulates rates and service conditions for the interstate transportation of liquids including crude oil condensate and NGLs under various statutes The Federal Trade Commission FTC the FERC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission CFTC hold statutory authority to monitor certain segments of the physical and futures energy commodities markets These agencies have imposed broad regulations prohibiting fraud and manipulation of such markets We are required to observe the market related regulations enforced by these agencies with regard to our physical sales of crude oil or other energy commodities and any related hedging activities that we undertake Any violation of the FTC FERC and CFTC prohibitions on market manipulation can result in substantial civil penalties amounting to over 10 million per violation per day These departments and agencies have substantial enforcement authority and the ability to grant and suspend operations and to levy substantial penalties for noncompliance Failure to comply with such regulations as interpreted and enforced could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition Federal leases  Most of our offshore operations are conducted on federal oil and natural gas leases in the OCS waters of the Gulf of Mexico The DOI has delegated its authority to issue federal leases granted under the OCSLA to the BOEM which has adopted and implemented regulations relating to the issuance and operation of oil and natural gas leases on the OCS These leases are awarded by the BOEM based on competitive bidding and contain relatively standardized terms These leases require compliance with the BOEM the BSEE and other government agency regulations and orders that are subject to interpretation and change The BSEE also regulates the plugging and abandonment of wells located on the OCS and following cessation of operations the removal or appropriate abandonment of all production facilities structures and pipelines on the OCS collectively these activities are referred to as decommissioning while the BOEM governs financial assurance requirements associated with those decommissioning obligations President Biden entered office in January 2021 and has made tackling climate change including the restriction or elimination of future greenhouse gases GHGs a priority in his administration The Biden Administration has already adopted several executive orders and is expected to pursue additional orders and pursue legislation regulations or other regulatory initiatives in support of this regulatory agenda Notably the Acting Secretary of the US Department of the Interior issued an order on January 20 2021 effective immediately that suspends new oil and gas leases and drilling permits on federal lands and offshore waters including the OCS for a period of 60 days Building on this suspension President Biden issued an executive order on January 27 2021 that suspends new leasing activities for oil and gas exploration and production on federal lands and offshore waters pending review and reconsideration of federal oil and gas permitting and leasing practices While these January 20 2021 and January 27 2021 orders do not apply to existing leases the January 27 2021 order further directs applicable agencies to take measures to eliminate provision of subsidies to the fossil fuel industry although the term subsidies is not defined by the adminstration We continue to conduct our operations on our existing leases in the OCS however uncertainty on future Biden Administration actions with regards to offshore oil and gas activities on the OCS together with the issuance of any future executive orders or adoption and implementation of laws rules or initiatives that further restrict delay or result in cancellation of existing oil and gas activities on the OCS could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations 3 Decommissioning and financial assurance requirements  The BOEM requires that lessees demonstrate financial strength and reliability according to its regulations and provide acceptable financial assurances to assure satisfaction of lease obligations including decommissioning activities on the OCS In 2016 the BOEM under the Obama Administration issued Notice to Lessees and Operators NTL 2016N01 NTL 2016N01 to clarify the procedures and guidelines that BOEM Regional Directors use to determine if and when additional financial assurances may be required for OCS leases rights of way ROWs and rights of use and easement RUEs While NTL 2016N01 became effective in September 2016 it was not fully implemented as the BOEM under the Trump Administration first extended indefinitely in 2017 implementation of the NTL and subsequently rescinded the NTL in the latter half of 2020 instead electing to publish in October 2020 a proposed rule that would amend the BOEMs financial assurance requirements The Biden Administration is expected to review and reconsider actions made under the Trump Administration with respect to provision of financial assurance including the rescission of NTL 2016N01 and publication of the October 2020 proposed rulemaking Any issuance by the Biden Administration of more stringent NTL guidance or rules relating to the provision of additional financial assurance may have a material adverse effect on us and similarly situated offshore oil and gas operators on the OCS Moreover the BOEM has the authority to issue liability orders in the future including if it determines there is a substantial risk of nonperformance of the interest holders decommissioning liabilities See Risk Factors under Part I Item 1A Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II Item 7 and Financial Statements and Supplementary Data under Part II Item 8 in this Form 10K for more discussion on decommissioning and financial assurance requirements Reporting of decommissioning expenditures Under applicable BSEE regulations lessees operating on the OCS and conducting decommissioning activities are required to submit summaries of actual expenditures for decommissioning of subject wells platforms and other facilities The BSEE has reported that it uses this summary information to better estimate future decommissioning costs and the BOEM typically relies upon the BSEEs estimates to set the amount of required bonds or other forms of financial security in order to minimize the governments perceived risk of potential decommissioning liability Unbundling The ONRR has publicly announced an unbundling initiative to revise the methodology employed by producers in determining the appropriate allowances for transportation and processing costs that are permitted to be deducted in determining royalties under Federal oil and gas leases The ONRRs initiative requires recomputing allowable transportation and processing costs using revised guidance from the ONRR going back 84 months for every gas processing plant utilized during that period Regulation and transportation of natural gas Our sales of natural gas are affected by the availability terms and cost of transportation The price and terms for access to pipeline transportation are subject to extensive regulation The FERC has undertaken various initiatives to increase competition within the natural gas industry As a result of initiatives like FERC Order No 636 issued in 1992 the interstate natural gas transportation and marketing system allows nonpipeline natural gas sellers including producers to effectively compete with interstate pipelines for sales to local distribution companies and large industrial and commercial customers The most significant provisions of Order No 636 require that interstate pipelines provide firm and interruptible transportation service on an open access basis that is equal for all natural gas supplies In many instances the effect of Order No 636 and related initiatives have been to substantially reduce or eliminate the interstate pipelines traditional role as wholesalers of natural gas in favor of providing only storage and transportation services The rates for such storage and transportation services are subject to FERC ratemaking authority and FERC exercises its authority either by applying costofservice principles or granting market based rates Similarly the natural gas pipeline industry is subject to state regulations which may change from time to time The OCSLA which is administered by the BOEM and the FERC requires that all pipelines operating on or across the OCS provide open access nondiscriminatory transportation service One of the FERCs principal goals in carrying out OCSLAs mandate is to increase transparency in the OCS market to provide producers and shippers assurance of open access service on pipelines located on the OCS and to provide nondiscriminatory rates and conditions of service on such pipelines The BOEM issued a final rule effective August 2008 which implements a hotline alternative dispute resolution procedures and complaint procedures for resolving claims of having been denied open and nondiscriminatory access to pipelines on the OCS In 2007 the FERC issued rules Order 704 requiring that any market participant including a producer such as us that engages in wholesale sales or purchases of natural gas that equal or exceed 22 million British thermal units MMBtu during a calendar year must annually report such sales and purchases to the FERC to the extent such transactions utilize contribute to or may contribute to the formation of price indices It is the responsibility of the reporting entity to determine which individual transactions should be reported based on the guidance of Order 704 Order 704 also requires market participants to indicate whether they report prices to any index publishers and if so whether their reporting complies with FERCs policy statement on price reporting These rules are intended to increase the transparency of the wholesale natural gas markets and to assist the FERC in monitoring such markets and in detecting market manipulation 4 Additional proposals and proceedings that might affect the natural gas industry are pending before Congress the FERC state legislatures state commissions and the courts The natural gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated As a result there is no assurance that the less stringent regulatory approach pursued by the FERC Congress and the states will continue While these federal and state regulations for the most part affect us only indirectly they are intended to enhance competition in natural gas markets We cannot predict what further action the FERC the BOEM or state regulators will take on these matters However we do not believe that any such action taken will affect us differently in any material way than other natural gas producers with which we compete Oil and NGLs transportation rates  Our sales of liquids which include crude oil condensate and NGLs are not currently regulated and are transacted at market prices In a number of instances however the ability to transport and sell such products is dependent on pipelines whose rates terms and conditions of service are subject to FERC jurisdiction The price we receive from the sale of crude oil and NGLs is affected by the cost of transporting those products to market Interstate transportation rates for crude oil condensate NGLs and other products are regulated by the FERC In general interstate crude oil condensate and NGL pipeline rates must be costbased although settlement rates agreed to by all shippers are permitted and market based rates may be permitted in certain circumstances The FERC has established an indexing system for such transportation which generally allows such pipelines to take an annual inflationbased rate increase In other instances the ability to transport and sell such products is dependent on pipelines whose rates terms and conditions of service are subject to regulation by state regulatory bodies under state statutes and regulations As it relates to intrastate crude oil condensate and NGL pipelines state regulation is generally less rigorous than the federal regulation of interstate pipelines State agencies have generally not investigated or challenged existing or proposed rates in the absence of shipper complaints or protests which are infrequent and are usually resolved informally We do not believe that the regulatory decisions or activities relating to interstate or intrastate crude oil condensate or NGL pipelines will affect us in a way that materially differs from the way they affect other crude oil condensate and NGL producers or marketers Regulation of oil and natural gas exploration and production Our exploration and production operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal state and local levels Such regulations include requiring permits bonds and pollution liability insurance for the drilling of wells regulating the location of wells the method of drilling casing operating plugging and abandoning wells and governing the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled Many states also have statutes or regulations addressing conservation of oil and gas resources including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties the establishment of maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells and the regulation of spacing of such wells Hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico can have a significant impact on oil and gas operations on the OCS The effects from past hurricanes have included structural damage to fixed production facilities semisubmersibles and jackup drilling rigs The BOEM and the BSEE continue to be concerned about the loss of these facilities and rigs as well as the potential for catastrophic damage to key infrastructure and the resultant pollution from future storms In an effort to reduce the potential for future damage the BOEM and the BSEE have periodically issued guidance aimed at improving platform survivability by taking into account environmental and oceanic conditions in the design of platforms and related structures Compliance with Environmental Regulations General We are subject to complex and stringent federal state and local environmental laws These laws among other things govern the issuance of permits to conduct exploration drilling and production operations the amounts and types of materials that may be released into the environment and the discharge and disposal of waste materials and to the extent waste materials are transported and disposed of in onshore facilities remediation of any releases of those waste materials from such facilities Numerous governmental agencies issue rules and regulations to implement and enforce such laws which are often costly to comply with and a failure to comply may result in substantial administrative civil and criminal penalties the imposition of investigatory remedial and corrective action obligations or the incurrence of capital expenditures the occurrence of restrictions delays or cancellations in the permitting or development or expansion of projects and the issuance of orders enjoining some or all of our operations in affected areas Certain environmental laws such as the federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 as amended OPA impose strict joint and several liability for environmental contamination such as may arise in the event of an accidental spill on the OCS rendering a person liable for environmental damage and cleanup costs without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such person The regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases our cost of doing business and consequently affects our profitability The cost of remediation reclamation and decommissioning including abandonment of wells platforms and other facilities in the Gulf of Mexico is significant These costs are considered a normal recurring cost of our ongoing operations Our competitors are subject to the same laws and regulations 5 Hazardous Substances and Wastes The federal Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act as amended CERCLA imposes liability without regard to fault on certain classes of persons that are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment These persons include the current or former owner or operator of the disposal site or sites where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances Under CERCLA such persons are subject to strict joint and several liability for the cost of investigating and cleaning up hazardous substances that have been released into the environment for damages to natural resources and for the cost of certain health studies The federal Solid Waste Disposal Act as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 RCRA regulates the generation transportation storage treatment and disposal of nonhazardous and hazardous wastes and can require cleanup of hazardous waste disposal sites RCRA currently excludes drilling fluids produced waters and certain other wastes associated with the exploration development or production of oil and natural gas from regulation as hazardous waste and the disposal of such oil and natural gas exploration development and production wastes is regulated under less onerous nonhazardous waste requirements usually under state law Standards have been developed under RCRA andor state laws for worker protection from exposure to Naturally Occurring Radioactive Materials NORM treatment storage and disposal of NORM and NORM waste management of NORMcontaminated piping valves containers and tanks Historically we have not incurred any material expenditures in connection with our compliance with the existing RCRA and applicable state laws related to NORM waste Air Emissions and Climate Change Air emissions from our operations are subject to the federal Clean Air Act as amended CAA and comparable state and local requirements We may be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment in connection with obtaining and maintaining operating permits and approvals for air emissions For example in 2015 the EPA issued a final rule under the CAA lowering the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for ground level ozone from 75 to 70 parts per billion Since that time the EPA issued area designations with respect to groundlevel ozone and on December 31 2020 published notice of a final action to retain the 2015 ozone NAAQS without revision on a goingforward basis However several groups have filed litigation over this December 2020 final action and the NAAQS may be subject to revision under the Biden Administration In the United States no comprehensive climate change legislation has been implemented at the federal level but President Biden is expected to issue executive orders or pursue legislative or regulatory actions to limit future GHG emissions For example on January 20 2021 President Biden issued an executive order committing the United States to the Paris Agreement from which the United States had withdrawn under the Trump Administration President Biden has called for the federal government to begin formulating the United States nationally determined emissions reduction goal under the agreement which may result in the issuance of GHG limitations in the future Additionally the threat of climate change may result in litigation and financial risks Litigation risks are increasing as a number of states municipalities and other plaintiffs have sought to bring suit against the largest oil and natural gas exploration and production companies in state or federal court alleging among other things that such companies created public nuisances by producing fuels that contributed to global warming effects and therefore are responsible for roadway and infrastructure damages as a result or alleging that the companies have been aware of the adverse effects of climate change for some time but defrauded their investors by failing to adequately disclose those impacts There are also increasing financial risks for fossil fuel producers as well as other companies handling fossil fuels as stockholders and bondholders currently invested in fossil fuel energy companies concerned about the potential effects of climate change may elect in the future to shift some or all of their investments into nonfossil fuel energy related sectors Institutional investors who provide financing to fossil fuel energy companies also have become more attentive to sustainability lending practices and some of them may elect not to provide funding for fossil fuel energy companies 6 From a regulatory perspective the EPA has determined that GHG emissions present a danger to public health and the environment and it has adopted regulations that among other things restrict emissions of GHG under existing provisions of the CAA and may require the installation of control technologies to limit emissions of GHG For example in 2016 the EPA under the Obama administration published a final rule establishing new source performance standards NSPS that require new modified or reconstructed facilities in the oil and natural gas sector to reduce methane gas and volatile organic compound emissions The 2016 rule applies to any new or significantly modified facilities that we construct in the future that would otherwise emit large volumes of GHG together with other criteria pollutants The 2016 new source performance standards regulate GHGs through limitations on emissions of methane However the EPA under the Trump Administration has undertaken several measures including publishing in September 2020 final rule policy and technical amendments to the NSPS for stationary sources of air emissions The policy amendments effective September 14 2020 notably removed the transmission and storage sector from the regulated source category and rescinded methane and volatile organic compound requirements for the remaining sources that were established by former President Obamas Administration whereas the technical amendments effective November 16 2020 included changes to fugitive emissions monitoring and repair schedules recordkeeping and reporting requirements and more Various states and industry and environmental groups are separately challenging both the original 2016 standards and the EPAs September 2020 final rules and on January 20 2021 President Biden issued an executive order that among other things directed EPA to reconsider the technical amendments and issue a proposed rule suspending revising or rescinding those amendments by no later than September 2021 A reconsideration of the September 2020 policy amendments is expected to follow The January 20 2021 executive order also directed the establishment of new methane and volatile organic compound standards applicable to existing oil and gas operations including the production transmission processing and storage segments Certain of our operations are subject to EPA rules requiring the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from specified offshore production sources The OCSLA authorized the DOI to regulate activities authorized by the BOEM in the Central and Western Gulf of Mexico EPA has air quality jurisdiction over all other parts of the OCS Under the OCSLA DOI is limited to regulating offshore emissions of criteria and their precursor  pollutants to the extent they significantly affect the air quality of any state On May 14 2020 the BOEM issued its final rule to update air quality regulations applicable to activities authorized by BOEM on the OCS in the Central and Western Gulf of Mexico This newly revised rule adopted changes such as incorporation of the definition of the NAAQS updated Significance Levels SLs added new requirements for PM25 and PM10 updates to emissions exemption thresholds and revision to the Air Quality Spreadsheets Water Discharges  The primary federal law for oil spill liability is the OPA which amends and augments oil spill provisions of the federal Water Pollution Control Act the Clean Water Act OPA imposes certain duties and liabilities on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and damages resulting from such spills in or threatening United States waters including the OCS or adjoining shorelines A liable responsible party includes the owner or operator of an onshore facility vessel or pipeline that is a source of an oil discharge or that poses the substantial threat of discharge or in the case of offshore facilities the lessee or permittee of the area in which a discharging facility is located OPA assigns joint and several strict liability without regard to fault to each liable party for all containment and oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages including but not limited to the costs of responding to oil and natural resource release related damages and economic damages suffered by persons adversely affected by an oil spill Although defenses exist to the liability imposed by OPA they are limited In January 2018 the BOEM raised OPAs damages liability cap to 1377 million however a party cannot take advantage of liability limits if the spill was caused by gross negligence or willful misconduct resulted from violation of a federal safety construction or operating regulation or if the party failed to report a spill or cooperate fully in the cleanup OPA requires owners and operators of offshore oil production facilities to establish and maintain evidence of financial responsibility to cover costs that could be incurred in responding to an oil spill and to prepare and submit for approval oil spill response plans These oil spill response plans must detail the action to be taken in the event of a spill identify contracted spill response equipment materials and trained personnel and identify the time necessary to deploy these resources in the event of a spill In addition OPA currently requires a minimum financial responsibility demonstration of between 350 million and 1500 million for companies operating on the OCS We are currently required to demonstrate on an annual basis that we have ready access to 1500 million that can be used to respond to an oil spill from our facilities on the OCS 7 The Clean Water Act and comparable state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the monitoring and discharge of pollutants including produced waters and other natural gas wastes into federal and state waters The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or an analogous state agency The EPA has also adopted regulations requiring certain onshore oil and natural gas exploration and production facilities to obtain individual permits or coverage under general permits for storm water discharges The treatment of wastewater or developing and implementing storm water pollution prevention plans as well as for monitoring and sampling the storm water runoff from our onshore gas processing plant have compliance costs Pursuant to these laws and regulations we may be required to obtain and maintain approvals or permits for the discharge of wastewater or storm water and are required to develop and implement spill prevention control and countermeasure plans also referred to as SPCC plans in connection with onsite storage of significant quantities of oil Marine Protected Areas and Endangered and Threatened Species  Executive Order 13158 issued in May 2000 directs federal agencies to safeguard existing Marine Protected Areas MPAs in the United States and establish new MPAs The order requires federal agencies to avoid harm to MPAs to the extent permitted by law and to the maximum extent practicable It also directs the EPA to propose new regulations under the Clean Water Act to ensure appropriate levels of protection for the marine environment In addition Federal Lease Stipulations include regulations regarding the taking of protected marine species sea turtles marine mammals Gulf sturgeon and other listed marine species Certain flora and fauna that have been officially classified as threatened or endangered are protected by the federal Endangered Species Act as amended ESA This law prohibits any activities that could take a protected plant or animal or reduce or degrade its habitat area The US Fish and Wildlife Service USFWS under former President Trump issued a final rule on January 7 2021 which notably clarifies that criminal liability under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act MBTA will apply only to actions directed at migratory birds its nests or its eggs While the rule was scheduled to become effective on February 8 2021 the USFWS subsequently published notice on February 9 2021 that it was delaying the effective date of this rule until March 8 2021 pursuant to the Biden Administration and in conformity with the Congressional Review Act Additionally the USFWS may make determinations on the listing of species as threatened or endangered under the ESA and litigation with respect to the listing or nonlisting of certain species may result in more fulsome protections for nonprotected or lesserprotected species We conduct operations on leases in areas where certain species that are listed as threatened or endangered are known to exist and where other species that potentially could be listed as threatened or endangered under the ESA may exist Other federal statutes that provide protection to animal and plant species and which may apply to our operations include but are not necessarily limited to the National Environmental Policy Act the Coastal Zone Management Act the Emergency Planning and Community RighttoKnow Act the Marine Mammal Protection Act the Marine Protection Research and Sanctuaries Act the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act the MagnusonStevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the National Historic Preservation Act These laws and related implementing regulations may require the acquisition of a permit or other authorization before construction or drilling commences and may limit or prohibit construction drilling and other activities on certain lands lying within wilderness or wetlands These and other protected areas may require certain mitigation measures to avoid harm to wildlife and such laws and regulations may impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations The leases and permits required for our various operations are subject to revocation modification and renewal by issuing authorities Moreover applicable leasing and permitting programs may be subject to legislative regulatory or executive actions to delay or suspend the issuance of leases and permits such as has occurred under the Biden Administrations DOI order issued on January 20 2021 with respect to drilling permits or cancellation of such programs Financial Information We operate our business as a single segment See Financial Statements and Supplementary Data under Part II Item 8 in this Form 10K for our financial information 8 Seasonality Generally the demand for and price of natural gas increases during the winter months and decreases during the summer months However these seasonal fluctuations are somewhat reduced because during the summer pipeline companies utilities local distribution companies and industrial users purchase and place into storage facilities a portion of their anticipated winter requirements of natural gas As utilities continue to switch from coal to natural gas some of this seasonality has been reduced as natural gas is used for both heating and cooling In addition the demand for oil is higher in the winter months but does not fluctuate seasonally as much as natural gas Seasonal weather changes affect our operations Tropical storms and hurricanes occur in the Gulf of Mexico during the summer and fall which require us to evacuate personnel and shut in production until the storm subsides Also periodic storms during the winter often impede our ability to safely load unload and transport personnel and equipment which delays the installation of production facilities thereby delaying production and sales of our oil and natural gas Human Capital Resources People are our most valuable asset and we strive to provide a work environment that attracts and retains the top talent in the industry reflects our core values and demonstrates our core values to the communities in which we operate As of December 31 2020 our

uncert ainties in the ordinary course of business that are common to all businesses important factors that are specific to us and our industry could materially impact our future performance and results of operations We have provided below a list of known material risk factors that should be reviewed when considering buying or selling our securities These are not all the risks we face and other factors currently considered immaterial or unknown to us may impact our future operations Market and Competitive Risks Crude oil natural gas and NGL prices can fluctuate widely due to a number of factors that are beyond our control Depressed oil natural gas or NGL prices adversely affects our business financial condition cash flow liquidity or results of operations and could affect our ability to fund future capital expenditures needed to find and replace reserves meet our financial commitments and to implement our business strategy The price we receive for our crude oil NGLs and natural gas production directly affects our revenues profitability access to capital ability to produce these commodities economically and future rate of growth Historically oil NGLs and natural gas prices have been volatile and subject to wide price fluctuations in response to domestic and global changes in supply and demand economic and legal forces events and uncertainties and numerous other factors beyond our control including  changes in global supply and demand for crude oil NGLs and natural gas  events that impact global market demand eg the reduced demand following the COVID19 pandemic  the actions of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries OPEC and major oil producing countries  the price and quantity of imports of foreign crude oil NGLs natural gas and liquefied natural gas into the US  acts of war terrorism or political instability in oil producing countries  domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes  political conditions and events including embargoes and moratoriums affecting oilproducing activities  the level of domestic and global oil and natural gas exploration and production activities  the level of global crude oil NGLs and natural gas inventories  adverse weather conditions  technological advances affecting energy consumption and the availability and cost of alternative energy sources  the price availability and acceptance of alternative fuels  cyberattacks on our information infrastructure or systems controlling offshore equipment  activities by nongovernmental organizations to restrict the exploration and production of oil and natural gas so as to minimize or eliminate future emissions of carbon dioxide methane gas and other GHG  the availability of pipeline and other transportation alternatives and third party processing capacity and  geographic differences in pricing These factors and the volatility of the energy markets which we expect to continue make it extremely difficult to predict future commodity prices with any certainty If crude oil NGLs and natural gas prices decrease from their current levels we may be required to further reduce the estimated volumes and future value associated with our total proved reserves or record impairments to the carrying values of our oil and natural gas properties Lower future crude oil NGLs and natural gas prices may reduce our estimates of the proved reserve volumes that may be economically recovered which would reduce the total volumes and future value of our proved reserves Under the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities a ceiling test is performed at the end of each quarter to determine if our oil and gas properties have been impaired Capitalized costs of oil and gas properties are generally limited to the present value of future net revenues of proved reserves based on the average price of the 12month period prior to the ending date of each quarterly assessment using the unweighted arithmetic average of the firstdayofthemonth price for each month within such period Impairments of our oil and gas properties are more likely to occur during prolonged periods of depressed crude oil NGL and natural gas pricing as we experienced in 2020 While we have not recorded an impairment of our oil and gas properties during the yearended December 31 2020 any further decreases in commodity pricing could cause an impairment which would result in a noncash charge to earnings 11 Commodity derivative positions may limit our potential gains In order to manage our exposure to price risk in the marketing of our oil and natural gas and as required under the Sixth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement the Credit Agreement we enter into oil and natural gas price commodity derivative positions with respect to a portion of our expected production See Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  Note 2  LongTerm Debt under Part II Item 8 in this Form 10K for a full description the Credit Agreement See Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 10  Derivative Financial Instruments under Part II Item 8 in this Form 10K for additional information on our derivative contracts and transactions We may enter into more derivative contracts in the future While these commodity derivative positions are intended to reduce the effects of crude oil and natural gas price volatility they may also limit future income if crude oil and natural gas prices were to rise substantially over the price established by such positions In addition such transactions may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances including instances in which there is a widening of price differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery points assumed in the hedge arrangements or the counterparties to the derivative contracts fail to perform under the terms of the contracts Competition for oil and natural gas properties and prospects is intense some of our competitors have larger financial technical and personnel resources that may give them an advantage in evaluating and obtaining properties and prospects We operate in a highly competitive environment for reviewing prospects acquiring properties marketing oil NGLs and natural gas and securing trained personnel Many of our competitors have financial resources that allow them to obtain substantially greater technical expertise and personnel than we have We actively compete with other companies in our industry when acquiring new leases or oil and natural gas properties For example new leases acquired from the BOEM are acquired through a sealed bid process and are generally awarded to the highest bidder Our competitors may be able to evaluate bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or personnel resources permit Our competitors may also be able to pay more to acquire productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects than we are able or willing to pay or finance Finally companies with larger financial resources may have a significant advantage in terms of meeting any potential new bonding requirements If we are unable to compete successfully in these areas in the future our future revenues and growth may be diminished or restricted Market conditions or operational impediments may hinder our access to oil and natural gas markets or delay our production The marketability of our production depends mostly upon the availability proximity and capacity of oil and natural gas gathering systems pipelines and processing facilities which in some cases are owned by third parties Market conditions or the unavailability of satisfactory oil and natural gas transportation arrangements may hinder our access to oil and natural gas markets or delay our production The availability of a ready market for our oil and natural gas production depends on a number of factors including the demand for and supply of oil and natural gas and the proximity of reserves to pipelines and terminal facilities Our ability to market our production depends substantially on the availability and capacity of gathering systems pipelines and processing facilities which in some cases are owned and operated by third parties We depend upon thirdparty pipelines that provide delivery options from our facilities Because we do not own or operate these pipelines their continued operation is not within our control These pipelines may become unavailable for a number of reasons including testing maintenance capacity constraints accidents government regulation weatherrelated events or other thirdparty actions If any of these thirdparty pipelines become partially or fully unavailable to transport crude oil and natural gas or if the gas quality specification for the natural gas pipelines changes so as to restrict our ability to transport natural gas on those pipelines our revenues could be adversely affected A portion of our oil and natural gas is processed for sale on platforms owned by third parties with no economic interest in our wells and no other processing facilities would be available to process such oil and natural gas without significant investment by us In addition thirdparty platforms could be damaged or destroyed by hurricanes which could reduce or eliminate our ability to market our production As of December 31 2020 three fields accounting for approximately 01 MMBoe or 1 of our 2020 production are tied back to separate thirdparty owned platforms There can be no assurance that the owners of such platforms will continue to process our oil and natural gas production We may be required to shut in wells because of a reduction in demand for our production or because of inadequacy or unavailability of pipelines gathering system capacity or processing facilities If that were to occur then we would be unable to realize revenue from those wells until arrangements were made to process or deliver our production to market We have in the past been required to shut in wells when hurricanes have caused or threatened damage to pipelines gathering stations and production facilities In addition certain thirdparty pipelines have submitted requests in the past to increase the fees they charge us to use these pipelines These increased fees if approved could adversely impact our revenues or increase our operating costs either of which would adversely impact our operating profits cash flows and reserves 12 Operating Risks Relatively short production periods for our Gulf of Mexico properties based on proved reserves subject us to high reserve replacement needs and require significant capital expenditures to replace our proved reserves at a faster rate than companies whose proved reserves have longer production periods If we are not able to obtain new oil and gas leases or replace reserves we will not be able to sustain production at current levels which may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations Our future success depends largely upon our ability to find develop or acquire additional oil and natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable in order to replace or grow our produced proved reserves Producing oil and natural gas reserves are generally characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors High production rates generally result in recovery of a relatively higher percentage of reserves during the initial few years of production All of our current production is from the Gulf of Mexico Proved reserves in the Gulf of Mexico generally have shorter reserve lives than proved reserves in many other producing regions of the United States in part due to the difference in rules related to booking proved undeveloped reserves between conventional and unconventional basins Our independent petroleum consultant estimates that 32 of our total proved reserves as of December 31 2020 will be depleted within three years As a result our need to replace proved reserves and production from new investments is relatively greater than that of producers who recover lower percentages of their proved reserves over a similar time period such as those producers who have a larger portion of their proved reserves in areas other than the Gulf of Mexico Historically we have funded our capital expenditures and acquisitions with cash on hand cash provided by operating activities capital markets securities offerings and bank borrowings The capital markets we have historically accessed may be constrained because of our leverage and also because in recent years institutional investors who provide financing to fossil fuel energy companies have become more attentive to sustainability lending practices and some of them may elect not to provide funding for fossil fuel energy companies and we may not be able to develop find or acquire additional proved reserves in sufficient quantities to sustain our current production levels or to grow production beyond current levels Future cash flows are subject to a number of variables such as the level of production from existing wells the prices of oil NGLs and natural gas and our success in developing and producing new reserves Any reductions in our capital expenditures to stay within internally generated cash flow which could be adversely affected if commodity prices decline and cash on hand will make replacing depleted reserves more difficult Losses and liabilities from uninsured or underinsured drilling and operating activities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations We are and could be exposed to uninsured losses in the future We currently carry multiple layers of insurance coverage in our Energy Package defined as certain insurance policies relating to our oil and gas properties which include named windstorm coverage covering our operating activities with higher limits of coverage for higher valued properties and wells Our insurance does not protect us against all operational risks We do not carry business interruption insurance Pollution and environmental risks are generally not fully insurable as gradual seepage and pollution are not covered under our policies Because thirdparty drilling contractors are used to drill our wells we may not realize the full benefit of workmens compensation laws in dealing with their employees Currently OPA requires owners and operators of offshore oil production facilities to have ready access to 1500 million that can be used to cover costs that could be incurred in responding to an oil spill our facilities on the OCS If OPA is amended to increase the minimum level of financial responsibility we may experience difficulty in providing financial assurances sufficient to comply with this requirement For some risks we have not obtained insurance as we believe the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented We reevaluate the purchase of insurance policy limits and terms annually Future insurance coverage for our industry could increase in cost and may include higher deductibles or retentions In addition some forms of insurance may become unavailable in the future or unavailable on terms that we believe are economically acceptable No assurance can be given that we will be able to maintain insurance in the future at rates that we consider reasonable and we may elect to maintain minimal or no insurance coverage The occurrence of a significant event not fully insured or indemnified against losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Hurricane Remediation Insurance Claims and Insurance Coverage under Part II Item 7 in this Form 10K for additional information on insurance coverage 13 We conduct exploration development and production operations on the deep shelf and in the deepwater of the Gulf of Mexico which presents unique operating risks The deep shelf and the deepwater of the Gulf of Mexico are areas that have had less drilling activity due in part to their geological complexity depth and higher cost to drill and ultimately develop There are additional risks associated with deep shelf and deepwater drilling that could result in substantial cost overruns andor result in uneconomic projects or wells Deeper targets are more difficult to interpret with traditional seismic processing Moreover drilling costs and the risk of mechanical failure are significantly higher because of the additional depth and adverse conditions such as high temperature and pressure For example the drilling of deepwater wells requires specific types of rigs with significantly higher day rates as compared to the rigs used in shallower water sophisticated sea floor production handling equipment expensive stateoftheart platforms and infrastructure investments Deepwater wells have greater mechanical risks because the wellhead equipment is installed on the sea floor In addition due to the significant time requirements involved with exploration and development activities particularly for wells in the deepwater or wells not located near existing infrastructure actual oil and natural gas production from new wells may not occur if at all for a considerable period of time following the commencement of any particular project Accordingly we cannot provide assurance that our oil and natural gas exploration activities in the deep shelf the deepwater and elsewhere will be commercially successful We may not be in a position to control the timing of development efforts associated costs or the rate of production of the reserves from our nonoperated properties As we carry out our drilling program we may not serve as operator of all planned wells In that case we have limited ability to exercise influence over the operations of some nonoperated properties and their associated costs Our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners and our limited ability to influence operations and associated costs of properties operated by others could prevent the realization of anticipated results in drilling or acquisition activities Our business involves many uncertainties and operating risks that can prevent us from realizing profits and can cause substantial losses The exploration development and production of oil and gas properties involves a variety of operating risks including the risk of fire explosions blowouts pipe failure abnormally pressured formations and environmental hazards Environmental hazards include oil spills gas leaks pipeline ruptures or discharges of toxic gases Additionally our offshore operations are subject to the additional hazards of marine operations such as capsizing collisions and adverse weather and sea conditions including the effects of hurricanes If we experience any of these problems well bores platforms gathering systems and processing facilities could be affected which could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations If any of these industry operating risks occur we could have substantial losses Substantial losses may be caused by injury or loss of life severe damage to or destruction of property natural resources and equipment pollution or other environmental damage cleanup responsibilities regulatory investigation and penalties suspension of operations and production repairs to resume operations and loss of reserves Any of these industry operating risks could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition The geographic concentration of our properties in the Gulf of Mexico subjects us to an increased risk of loss of revenues or curtailment of production from factors specifically affecting the Gulf of Mexico The geographic concentration of our properties along the US Gulf Coast and adjacent waters on and beyond the OCS means that some or all of our properties could be affected by the same event should the Gulf of Mexico experience severe weather including tropical storms and hurricanes delays or decreases in production the availability of equipment facilities or services changes in the status of pipelines that we depend on for transportation of our production to the marketplace delays or decreases in the availability of capacity to transport gather or process production and changes in the regulatory environment Because a majority of our properties could experience the same conditions at the same time these conditions could have a greater impact on our results of operations than they might have on other operators who have properties over a wider geographic area 14 Insurance for well control and hurricane damage may become significantly more expensive for less coverage and some losses currently covered by insurance may not be covered in the future In the past hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico have caused catastrophic losses and property damage Well control insurance coverage becomes limited from time to time and the cost of such coverage becomes both more costly and more volatile In the past we have been able to renew our policies each annual period but our coverage has varied depending on the premiums charged our assessment of the risks and our ability to absorb a portion of the risks The insurance market may further change dramatically in the future due to hurricane damage major oil spills or other events In the future our insurers may not continue to offer what we view as reasonable coverage or our costs may increase substantially as a result of increased premiums There could be an increased risk of uninsured losses that may have been previously insured We are also exposed to the possibility that in the future we will be unable to buy insurance at any price or that if we do have claims the insurance companies will not pay our claims The occurrence of any or all of these possibilities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations Estimates of our proved reserves depend on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate Any material inaccuracies in the estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities of and present value of future net revenues from our proved reserves The process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex It requires interpretations of available technical data and many assumptions including assumptions relating to economic factors Any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities and the calculation of the present value of our reserves at December 31 2020 In order to prepare our yearend reserve estimates our independent petroleum consultant projected our production rates and timing of development expenditures Our independent petroleum consultant also analyzed available geological geophysical production and engineering data The extent quality and reliability of this data can vary and may not be under our control The process also requires economic assumptions about matters such as crude oil and natural gas prices operating expenses capital expenditures taxes and availability of funds Therefore estimates of oil and natural gas reserves are inherently imprecise Actual future production crude oil and natural gas prices revenues taxes development expenditures operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves will most likely vary from our estimates Any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves In addition our independent petroleum consultant may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history drilling results prevailing oil and natural gas prices and other factors many of which are beyond our control You should not assume that the standardized measure or the present value of future net revenues from our proved oil and natural gas reserves is the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves In accordance with SEC requirements we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on the 12month unweighted firstdayofthemonth average price for each product and costs in effect on the date of the estimate Actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the present value estimate Prospects that we decide to drill may not yield oil or natural gas in commercial quantities or quantities sufficient to meet our targeted rates of return A prospect is an area in which we own an interest could acquire an interest or have operating rights and have what our geoscientists believe based on available seismic and geological information to be indications of economic accumulations of oil or natural gas Our prospects are in various stages of evaluation ranging from a prospect that is ready to be drilled to a prospect that will require substantial seismic data processing and interpretation which will not enable us to know conclusively prior to drilling whether oil or natural gas will be present or if present whether oil or natural gas will be present in commercial quantities Sustained low crude oil NGLs and natural gas pricing will also significantly impact the projected rates of return of our projects without the assurance of significant reductions in costs of drilling and development To the extent we drill additional wells in the deepwater andor on the deep shelf our drilling activities could become more expensive In addition the geological complexity of deepwater and deep shelf formations may make it more difficult for us to sustain our historical rates of drilling success As a result we can offer no assurance that we will find commercial quantities of oil and natural gas and therefore we can offer no assurance that we will achieve positive rates of return on our investments 15 The COVID19 pandemic has affected and may continue to materially adversely affect our industry business financial condition or results of operations The COVID19 pandemic and related economic repercussions have created significant volatility uncertainty and turmoil in the oil and gas industry The COVID19 outbreak and the responsive actions to limit the spread of the virus have significantly reduced global economic activity resulting in a decline in the demand for oil natural gas and other commodities These economic consequences have been a primary cause of the significant supplyanddemand imbalance for oil The current supplyanddemand imbalance and significantly lower oil pricing may continue to affect us constraining our ability to store and move production to downstream markets or affecting future decisions to delay or curtail development activity or temporarily shutin production which could further reduce cash flow The extent of the impact of the COVID19 pandemic and any other future pandemic on our business will depend on the nature spread and duration of the disease the responsive actions to contain its spread or address its effects its effect on the demand for oil and natural gas the timing and severity of the related consequences on commodity prices and the economy more generally including any recession resulting from the pandemic among other things Any extended period of depressed commodity prices or general economic disruption as a result of the pandemic would adversely affect our business financial conditions and results of operations In addition the COVID19 pandemic has heightened the other risks and uncertainties described in this report Our operations could be adversely impacted by security breaches including cybersecurity breaches which could affect the systems processes and data needed to run our business We rely on our information technology infrastructure and management information systems to operate and record aspects of our business Although we take measures to protect against cybersecurity risks including unauthorized access to our confidential and proprietary information our security measures may not be able to detect or prevent every attempted breach Similar to other companies we have experienced cyberattacks although we have not suffered any material losses related to such attacks Security breaches include among other things illegal hacking computer viruses interference with treasury function theft or acts of vandalism or terrorism A breach could result in an interruption in our operations malfunction of our platform control devices disabling of our communication links unauthorized publication of our confidential business or proprietary information unauthorized release of customer or employee data violation of privacy or other laws and exposure to litigation Any of these security breaches could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows The loss of members of our senior management could adversely affect us To a large extent we depend on the services of our senior management The loss of the services of any of our senior management could have a negative impact on our operations We do not maintain or plan to obtain for the benefit of the Company any insurance against the loss of any of these individuals See Executive Officers of the Registrant under Part I following Item 3 in this Form 10K for more information regarding our senior management team Capital Risks We have a significant amount of indebtedness and limited borrowing capacity under our current Credit Agreement which may be reduced by our lenders Our leverage and debt service obligations may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and business prospects and we may have difficulty paying our debts as they become due As of December 31 2020 we had 6325 million in principal of indebtedness outstanding and 44 million of letters of credit obligations outstanding substantially all of which is secured During 2020 we incurred 615 million in interest expense Our leverage and debt service obligations could  increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions including reduced demand during the COVID19 pandemic  limit our ability to fund future working capital requirements capital expenditures and ARO to engage in future acquisitions or development activities or to otherwise realize the value of our assets  limit our opportunities because of the need to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments of interest and principal on our debt obligations or to comply with any restrictive terms of our debt obligations  limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future or require us to seek alternative financing which may be more restrictive or expensive and  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt 16 Any of the above listed factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flows and results of operations If new debt is added to our current debt levels the related risks that we face could intensify Additionally availability of borrowings and letters of credit under our Credit Agreement is determined by establishment of a borrowing base which is periodically redetermined in lenders sole discretion based on our lenders review of crude oil NGLs and natural gas prices our proved reserves and other criteria Lower crude oil NGLs and natural gas prices in the future would also adversely affect our cash flow and could result in reductions in our borrowing base and sources of alternate credit and affect our ability to satisfy the covenants and ratios required by the Credit Agreement and Indenture We cannot be certain that our cash flow will be sufficient to allow us to pay the principal and interest on our debt or otherwise meet our future obligations In such scenarios we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt sell assets reduce capital expenditures obtain new financing or issue equity However we may not be able to accomplish any of these transactions on terms acceptable to us or such actions may not yield sufficient capital to meet our obligations Any of the above risks could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flows and results of operations Our debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our abilities to incur certain additional debt or liens or engage in other transactions which could limit growth and our ability to respond to changing conditions The Indenture and Credit Agreement governing our indebtedness contain a number of significant restrictive covenants in addition to covenants restricting the incurrence of additional debt These covenants limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries among other things to  make loans and investments  incur additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock  create certain liens  sell assets  enter into agreements that restrict dividends or other payments from our restricted subsidiaries to us  consolidate merge or transfer all or substantially all of the assets of our company  engage in transactions with our affiliates  pay dividends or make other distributions on capital stock or indebtedness and  create unrestricted subsidiaries Our Credit Agreement requires us among other things to maintain certain financial ratios and satisfy certain financial condition tests or reduce our debt These restrictions may also limit our ability to obtain future financings withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general or otherwise conduct necessary corporate activities We may also be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of the limitations imposed on us from the restrictive covenants under our indentures governing our outstanding notes A breach of any covenant in the agreements governing our debt would result in a default under such agreement after any applicable grace periods A default if not waived could result in acceleration of the debt outstanding under such agreement and in a default with respect to and acceleration of the debt outstanding under any other debt agreements The accelerated debt would become immediately due and payable If that should occur we may not be able to make all of the required payments or borrow sufficient funds to refinance such accelerated debt Even if new financing were then available it may not be on terms that are acceptable to us If we default on our secured debt the value of the collateral securing our secured debt may not be sufficient to ensure repayment of all of such debt All of our existing indebtedness under our Credit Agreement and our outstanding Second Lien Senior Notes is secured by liens on substantially all of our oil natural gas and NGL properties In addition we have certain rights to issue or incur additional or new secured debt including up to 1056 million as of January 6 2021 available for borrowing under our Credit Agreement following the most recent redetermination that would be secured by additional liens on the collateral and an issuance or incurrence of such additional secured debt would dilute the value of the collateral securing our outstanding secured debt If the proceeds of any sale of the collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due in respect of our secured debt then claims against our remaining assets to repay any amounts still outstanding under our secured obligations would be unsecured and our ability to pay our other unsecured obligations and any distributions in respect of our capital stock would be significantly impaired 17 With respect to some of the collateral securing our debt any collateral trustees security interest and ability to foreclose on the collateral will also be limited by the need to meet certain requirements such as obtaining third party consents paying court fees that may be based on the principal amount of the parity lien obligations and making additional filings If we are unable to obtain these consents pay such fees or make these filings the security interests may be invalid and the applicable holders and lenders will not be entitled to the collateral or any recovery with respect thereto These requirements may limit the number of potential bidders for certain collateral in any foreclosure and may delay any sale either of which events may have an adverse effect on the sale price of the collateral We may be required to post cash collateral pursuant to our agreements with sureties under our existing or future bonding arrangements which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our ability to execute our capital expenditure plan our ARO plan and comply with our existing debt instruments Pursuant to the terms of our agreements with various sureties under our existing bonding arrangements or under any future bonding arrangements we may enter into we may be required to post collateral at any time on demand at the suretys sole discretion Additional collateral would likely be in the form of cash or letters of credit We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to satisfy collateral demands for current bonds or for future bonds If we are required to provide additional collateral our liquidity position will be negatively impacted and we may be required to seek alternative financing To the extent we are unable to secure adequate financing we may be forced to reduce our capital expenditures in the current year or future years may be unable to execute our ARO plan or may be unable to comply with our existing debt instruments Legal and Regulatory Risks The recent election of President Biden and changes in US Congress may result in significant legislative and regulatory changes that could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to implement our business strategy Recently elected President Biden has indicated that his administration will pursue regulatory initiatives executive actions and legislation in support of his regulatory and political agenda which includes the reduction in dependence on and use of fossil fuels and curtailment of hydraulic fracturing on federal lands in response to climate change and other environmental risks Our operations in the Gulf of Mexico require permits from federal and state governmental agencies in order to perform drilling and completion activities and conduct other regulated activities Under certain circumstances US federal agencies may refuse to approve new leases for hydrocarbon exploration and development on federal lands and waters and may refuse to grant or delay approvals required for development of existing leases on such lands and waters See Part I Item 1 Business  Compliance with Environmental Regulations for more discussion on orders and regulatory initiatives impacting the oil and natural gas industry that are being pursued under the Biden Administration To the extent that our operations in federal waters are restricted delayed for varying lengths of time or cancelled such developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations our ability to replace reserves and the ability to implement our business strategy We may be unable to provide the financial assurances in the amounts and under the time periods required by the BOEM if the BOEM submits future demands to cover our decommissioning obligations If in the future the BOEM issues orders to provide additional financial assurances and we fail to comply with such future orders the BOEM could elect to take actions that would materially adversely impact our operations and our properties including commencing proceedings to suspend our operations or cancel our federal offshore leases The BOEM requires that lessees demonstrate financial strength and reliability according to its regulations and provide acceptable financial assurances to assure satisfaction of lease obligations including decommissioning activities on the OCS As of the filing date of this Form 10K we are in compliance with our financial assurance obligations to the BOEM and have no outstanding BOEM orders requests or financial assurance obligations The BOEM under the Obama Administration had sought to implement more stringent and costly standards under the existing federal financial assurance requirements through issuance and implementation of NTL 2016N01 but former President Trumps Administration first paused and then in 2020 rescinded the implementation of this NTL while the BOEM issued a proposed rulemaking in October 2020 to amend its financial assurance program The BOEM under the Biden Administration may in the future reconsider offshore financial assurance requirements including the rescinded NTL 2016N01 and the October 2020 proposed rule and adopt and implement more stringent requirements Moreover the BOEM could make demands for additional financial assurances covering our obligations under our properties which could exceed the Companys capabilities to provide If we fail to comply with such future orders the BOEM could commence enforcement proceedings or take other remedial action including assessing civil penalties suspending operations or production or initiating procedures to cancel leases which if upheld would have a material adverse effect on our business properties results of operations and financial condition 18 We may be limited in our ability to maintain or recognize additional proved undeveloped reserves under current SEC guidance SEC rules require that subject to limited exceptions PUD reserves may only be booked if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years after the date of initial booking This requirement may limit our ability to book additional PUD reserves as we pursue our drilling program Moreover we may be required to write down our PUD reserves if we do not drill those wells within the required fiveyear timeframe Additional deepwater drilling laws regulations and other restrictions delays and other offshorerelated developments in the Gulf of Mexico may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations President Biden and one or more of agencies under his administration has issued orders temporarily suspending leasing or permitting of oil and natural gas activities on federal lands and waters including the OCS and his administration is expected to pursue additional orders legislation and regulatory initiatives regarding deep water leasing permitting or drilling that could result in more stringent or costly restrictions delays or cancellations to our operations as well as those of similarly situated offshore energy companies on the OCS The BSEE and the BOEM have over the past decade primarily under the Obama Administration imposed more stringent permitting procedures and regulatory safety and performance requirements with respect to new wells drilled in federal deepwater While in recent years under the Trump Administration there have been actions by BSEE or BOEM seeking to mitigate or delay certain of those more rigorous standards we expect that the Biden Administration may reconsider rules and regulatory initiatives implemented under the Trump Administration Compliance with any added and more stringent regulatory requirements and with existing environmental and spill regulations together with uncertainties or inconsistencies in decisions and rulings by governmental agencies and delays in the processing and approval of drilling permits and exploration development oil spill response and decommissioning plans and possible additional regulatory initiatives could result in difficult and more costly actions and adversely affect or delay new drilling and ongoing development efforts Moreover these governmental agencies under the Biden Administration are expected to continue to evaluate aspects of safety and operational performance in the United States Gulf of Mexico that could result in new more restrictive requirements For example under the Trump Administration BSEE reviewed and delayed or revised certain offshore regulations implemented during the Obama Administration with respect to the imposition of rigorous standards relating to well control In light of the statements made by President Biden there exists a significant risk that these Obamaera regulations or additional more stringent regulations impacting our business properties and results of operations could be reimplemented or adopted during the Biden Administration These regulatory actions or any new rules regulations or legal initiatives or controls that impose increased costs or more stringent operational standards could delay or disrupt our operations result in increased supplemental bonding and costs and limit activities in certain areas or cause us to incur penalties fines or shutin production at one or more of our facilities or result in the suspension or cancellation of leases Also if material spill incidents were to occur in the future the United States could elect to issue directives to temporarily cease drilling activities and in any event issue further safety and environmental laws and regulations regarding offshore oil and natural gas exploration and development any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business We cannot predict with any certainty the full impact of any new laws or regulations on our drilling operations or on the cost or availability of insurance to cover some or all of the risks associated with such operations See Part I Item 1 Business  Compliance with Environmental Regulations for more discussion on orders and regulatory initiatives impacting the oil and natural gas industry that are being pursued under the Biden Administration Our estimates of future ARO may vary significantly from period to period and are especially significant because our operations are concentrated in the Gulf of Mexico We are required to record a liability for the present value of our ARO to plug and abandon inactive nonproducing wells to remove inactive or damaged platforms and inactive or damaged facilities and equipment collectively referred to as idle iron and to restore the land or seabed at the end of oil and natural gas production operations In December 2018 BSEE issued an updated NTL reaffirming the obligations of offshore operators to timely decommission idle iron by means of abandonment and removal Pursuant to the idle iron NTL requirements in September 2019 BSEE issued us letters directing us to plug and abandon certain wells that the agency identified as no longer capable of production in paying quantities by specified timelines with the earliest deadline being December 31 2020 In response we are currently evaluating the list of wells proposed as idle iron by BSEE and currently anticipate that those wells determined to be idle iron will be decommissioned by the specified timelines or at times as otherwise determined by BSEE following further discussions with the agency While we have established AROs for well decommissioning additional AROs significant in amount may be necessary to conduct plugging and abandonment of the wells designated by BSEE as idle iron but we do not expect the costs to plug and abandon these wells will have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows Nevertheless these decommissioning activities are typically considerably more expensive for offshore operations as compared to most landbased operations due to increased regulatory scrutiny and the logistical issues associated with working in waters of various depths and there exists the possibility that increased liabilities beyond what we established as AROs may arise and the pace for completing these activities could be adversely affected by idle iron decommissioning activities being pursued by other offshore oil and gas lessees that may also have received similar BSEE directives which could restrict the availability of equipment and experienced workforce necessary to accomplish this work 19 Moreover BSEE under the Biden Administration could also reconsider its 2018 NTL or existing idle ironrelated regulations and establish new more stringent decommissioning requirements on an expedited basis Estimating future restoration and removal costs in the Gulf of Mexico is especially difficult because most of the removal obligations may be many years in the future regulatory requirements are subject to change or such requirements may be interpreted more restrictively and asset removal technologies are constantly evolving which may result in additional or increased costs As a result we may make significant increases or decreases to our estimated ARO in future periods For example because we operate in the Gulf of Mexico platforms facilities and equipment are subject to damage or destruction as a result of hurricanes The estimated cost to plug and abandon a well or dismantle a platform can change dramatically if the host platform from which the work was anticipated to be performed is damaged or toppled rather than structurally intact Accordingly our estimate of future ARO will differ dramatically from our recorded estimate if we have a damaged platform The additional requirements under BOEMs formerly issued NTL 2016N01 if it were reissued and fully implemented or in the event BOEM under the Biden Administration were to otherwise issue new more stringent financial assurance guidance or requirements would increase our operating costs and reduce the availability of surety bonds due to the increased demands for such bonds in a lowprice commodity environment In addition increased demand for salvage contractors and equipment could result in increased costs for decommissioning activities including plugging and abandonment operations These items have and may further increase our costs and impact our liquidity adversely In addition the US Government imposes strict joint and several liability under the OCSLA on the various lessees of a federal oil and gas lease for lease obligations including decommissioning activities which means that any single colessee may be liable to the US Government for the full amount of all of the multiple lessees obligations under the lease In certain circumstances we also could be liable for accrued decommissioning liabilities on federal oil and gas leases that we previously owned and assigned to an unrelated third party should the assignee to whom we assigned the leases or any future assignee of those leases is unable to perform its decommissioning obligations including payment of costs incurred by unrelated parties in decommissioning such lease facilities For example we have in the past received a demand for payment of decommissioning costs related to property interests that were sold several years prior These indirect obligations would affect our costs operating profits and cash flows negatively and could be substantial We are subject to numerous laws and regulations that can adversely affect the cost manner or feasibility of doing business Our operations and facilities are subject to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the exploration development production and transportation of crude oil and natural gas and operational safety Future laws or regulations any adverse change in the interpretation of existing laws and regulations or our failure to comply with such legal requirements may harm our business results of operations and financial condition Our operations could be significantly delayed or curtailed and our cost of operations could significantly increase as a result of regulatory requirements or restrictions Regulated matters include lease permit restrictions limitations on our drilling activities in environmentally sensitive areas such as marine habitats and restrictions on the way we can discharge materials into the environment bonds or other financial responsibility requirements to cover drilling contingencies and well decommissioning costs the spacing of wells operational reporting reporting of natural gas sales for resale and taxation Under these laws and regulations we could be liable for personal injuries property and natural resource damages well site reclamation costs and governmental sanctions such as fines and penalties We are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations It is also possible that a portion of our oil and natural gas properties could be subject to eminent domain proceedings or other government takings for which we may not be adequately compensated See Business  Regulation under Part I Item 1 in this Form 10K for a more detailed explanation of regulations impacting our business Our operations may incur substantial liabilities to comply with environmental laws and regulations as well as legal requirements applicable to MPAs and endangered and threatened species Our oil and natural gas operations are subject to stringent federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the release or disposal of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection These laws and regulations require the acquisition of a permit or other approval before drilling or other regulated activity commences restrict the types quantities and concentration of substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities limit or prohibit exploration or drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness wetlands MPAs and other protected areas or that may affect certain wildlife including marine species and endangered and threatened species and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations 20 Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative civil and criminal penalties loss of our leases incurrence of investigatory remedial or corrective obligations and the imposition of injunctive relief which could prohibit limit or restrict our operations in a particular area Changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently and any changes that result in more stringent or costly waste handling storage transport disposal or cleanup requirements could require us to make significant expenditures to attain and maintain compliance and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our industry in general and on our own results of operations competitive position or financial condition Under these environmental laws and regulations we could incur strict joint and several liability for the removal or remediation of previously released materials or property contamination regardless of whether we were responsible for the release or contamination and regardless of whether our operations met previous standards in the industry at the time they were conducted Our permits require that we report any incidents that cause or could cause environmental damages New laws and regulations amendment of existing laws and regulations reinterpretation of legal requirements or increased governmental enforcement could significantly increase our capital expenditures and operating costs or could result in delays limitations or cancelations to our exploration and production activities which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows See Business  Environmental Regulations under Part I Item 1 in this Form 10K for a more detailed description of our environmental marine species and endangered and threatened species regulations The threat of climate change could result in increased costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas we produce which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows The threat of climate change continues to attract considerable attention in the United States and foreign countries As a result numerous proposals have been made and are likely to continue to be made at the international national regional and state levels of government to monitor and limit emissions of GHGs as well as to eliminate such future emissions As a result our operations are subject to a series of regulatory political and litigation and financial risks associated with the production and processing of fossil fuels and emission of GHGs See Part I Item 1 Business  Compliance with Environmental Regulations for more discussion on the threat of climate and restriction of GHG emissions The adoption and implementation of any international federal regional or state legislation executive actions regulations or other regulatory initiatives that impose more stringent standards for GHG emissions on our operations or in areas where we produce oil and natural gas could result in increased compliance costs or costs of consuming fossil fuels and thereby reduce demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce Additionally political financial and litigation risks may result in us having to restrict delay or cancel production activities incur liability for infrastructure damages as a result of climatic changes or impair the ability to continue to operate in an economic manner which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows Increasing attention to climate change increasing societal expectations on companies to address climate change and potential customer use of substitutes to energy commodities may result in increased costs reduced demand for oil and natural gas we produce resulting in reduced profits increased investigations and litigation and negative impacts on our stock price and access to capital markets Moreover the increased competitiveness of alternative energy sources such as wind solar geothermal tidal and biofuels could reduce demand for the oil and natural gas we produce which would lead to a reduction in our revenues Finally increasing concentrations of GHG in the Earths atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects such as increased frequency and severity of storms droughts floods rising sea levels and other climatic events Item 1B Unresolved Staff Comments None 21 Item 2 Properties Our producing fields are located in federal and state waters in the Gulf of Mexico in water depths ranging from less than 10 feet up to 7300 feet The reservoirs in our offshore fields are generally characterized as having high porosity and permeability with higher

operation of major significance is described in detail below Unless indicated otherwise drilling or drilled in the descriptions below refers to when the drilling reached target depth as this measurement usually has a higher correlation to changes in proved reserves compared to using the SECs definition for completion Following are descriptions of these areas of operations Mobile Bay Properties The Mobile Bay Properties consist of interests located off the coast of Alabama in state coastal and federal Gulf of Mexico waters approximately 70 miles south of Mobile Alabama The field area includes 16 Alabama state water lease blocks and four Federal OCS lease blocks These properties include seven major platforms and 27 flowing wells in up to 50 feet of water Exxon first discovered Norphlet gas play in 1978 with the first gas production from the Mary Ann Field in 1988 We acquired varied operated working interests ranging from 25 to 100 in nine producing fields from Exxon effective January 1 2019 and we became the operator of the fields in December 2019 During 2020 we completed the purchase of the remaining interest in two federal Mobile Bay fields from Chevron USA Inc Chevron Cumulative field production through 2020 is approximately 6983 MMBoe gross The Mobile Bay Properties produce from the Jurassic age Norphlet eolian sandstone at an average depth of 21000 total vertical depth As of December 31 2020 56 Norphlet wells have been drilled on the Mobile Bay Properties 45 wells were successful and 27 wells are currently producing We acquired the Mobile Bay

covers Ship Shoal federal OCS blocks 349 and 359 with a single production platform on Ship Shoal block 349 in 375 feet of water Phillips Petroleum Company discovered the field in 1993 We initially acquired a 25 working interest in the field from BP Amoco in 1999 In 2003 we acquired an additional 34 working interest through a transaction with ConocoPhillips that increased our working interest to approximately 59 and we became the operator of the field in December 2004 In early 2008 we acquired the remaining working interest from Apache Corporation Apache and we now own a 100 working interest in this field except for an interest in one well owned in the Joint Venture Drilling Program Cumulative field production through 2020 is approximately 566 MMBoe gross This field is a subsalt development with nine productive horizons below salt at depths up to 18000 feet As of December 31 2020 31 wells have been drilled and 26 were successful Since acquiring an interest and subsequently taking over as operator we have directly participated in drilling 17 wells with a 100 success rate During 2018 one well was completed which had been drilled to target depth during 2017 and in addition two wells were drilled and completed during 2018 During 2019 one well was drilled completed and producing in 2019 and significant workover activities were done to increase production There was no

as of December 31 2020 were determined to be economically producible under existing economic conditions which requires the use of the 12month average commodity price for each product calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the firstdayofthemonth price for the year end December 31 2020 Applying this methodology the West Texas Intermediate WTI average spot price of  3954per barrel and the Henry Hub natural gas average spot price of 1985per million British Thermal Unit were utilized as the referenced price and after adjusting for quality transportation fees energy content and regional price differentials the average realized prices were 3778 per barrel for oil 1029 per barrel for NGLs and 205 per Mcf for natural gas In determining the estimated realized price for NGLs a ratio was computed for each field of the NGLs realized price compared to the crude oil realized price Then this ratio was applied to the crude oil price using SEC guidance Such prices were held constant throughout the estimated lives of the reserves Future production and development costs are based on yearend costs with no escalations 2 Totals may not compute due to rounding The energyequivalent ratio does not assume price equivalency and the energyequivalent price for oil and NGLs may differ significantly Neither PV10 nor PV10 after ARO are financial measures defined under GAAP therefore the following table reconciles these amounts to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure Management believes that the nonGAAP financial measures of PV10 and PV10 after ARO are relevant and useful for evaluating the relative monetary significance of oil and natural gas properties PV10 and PV10 after ARO are used internally when assessing the potential return on investment related to oil and natural gas properties and in evaluating acquisition opportunities We believe the use of pretax measures is valuable because there are many unique factors that can impact an individual company when estimating the amount of future income taxes to be paid Management believes that the presentation of PV10 and PV10 after ARO provide useful information to investors because they are widely used by professional analysts and sophisticated investors in evaluating oil and natural gas companies PV10 and PV10 after ARO are not measures of financial or operating performance under GAAP nor are they intended to represent the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves PV10 and PV10 after ARO should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows as defined under GAAP Investors should not assume that PV10 or PV10 after ARO of our proved oil and natural gas reserves shown above represent a current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves 25 The reconciliation of PV10 and PV10 after ARO to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves is as follows in millions December 31 2020 Present value of estimated future net revenues PV10  7409 Present value of estimated ARO discounted at 10 2042  PV10 after ARO 5367 Future income taxes discounted at 10 430  Standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows  4937 Changes in Proved Reserves Our total proved reserves at December 31 2020 were 1444 MMBoe compared to 1574 MMBoe at December 31 2019 representing an overall decrease of 130 MMBoe Total proved reserves decreased by 277 MMBoe as a result of lower commodity prices and 154 MMBoe due to production Partially offsetting these decreases were increases in proved reserves of 262 MMBoe due to positive technical revisions including increased well performance 36 MMBoe related to acquisitions 02 MMBoe related to extensions and discoveries See Development of Proved Undeveloped Reserves below for a table reconciling the change in proved undeveloped reserves during 2020 See Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 20  Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures under Part II Item 8 in this Form 10K for additional information Our estimates of proved reserves PV10 and the standardized measure as December 31 2020 are calculated based upon SEC mandated 2020 unweighted average firstdayofthemonth crude oil and natural gas benchmark prices and adjusting for quality transportation fees energy content and regional price differentials which may or may not represent current prices If prices fall below the 2020 levels absent significant proved reserve additions this may reduce future estimated proved reserve volumes due to lower economic limits and economic return thresholds for undeveloped reserves as well as impact our results of operations cash flows quarterly full cost impairment ceiling tests and volumedependent depletion cost calculations See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II Item 7 in this Form 10K for additional information Qualifications of Technical Persons and Internal Controls over Reserves Estimation Process Our estimated proved reserve information as of December 31 2020 included in this Form 10K was prepared by our independent petroleum consultants NSAI in accordance with generally accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation principles and definitions and guidelines established by the SEC We maintain an internal staff of reservoir engineers and geoscience professionals who work closely with our independent petroleum consultant to ensure the integrity accuracy and timeliness of the data methods and assumptions used in the preparation of the reserves estimates Additionally our senior management reviews any significant changes to our proved reserves on a quarterly basis Our Director of Reservoir Engineering has over 30 years of oil and gas industry experience and has managed the preparation of public company reserve estimates the last 16 years He joined the Company in 2016 after spending the preceding 12 years as Director of Corporate Engineering for FreeportMcMoRan Oil  Gas He has also served in various engineering and strategic planning roles with both KerrMcGee and with Conoco Inc He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering from Texas AM University in 1989 and a Masters degree in Business Administration from the University of Houston in 1999 26 Reserve Technologies Proved reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations The term reasonable certainty implies a high degree of confidence that the quantities of oil andor natural gas actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate To achieve reasonable certainty our independent petroleum consultant employed technologies that have been demonstrated to yield results with consistency and repeatability The technologies and economic data used in the estimation of our proved reserves include but are not limited to well logs geologic maps seismic data well test data production data historical price and cost information and property ownership interests The accuracy of the estimates of our reserves is a function of  the quality and quantity of available data and the engineering and geological interpretation of that data  estimates regarding the amount and timing of future operating costs severance taxes development costs and workovers all of which may vary considerably from actual results  the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions such as the future prices of crude oil NGLs and natural gas and  the judgment of the persons preparing the estimates Because these estimates depend on many assumptions any or all of which may differ substantially from actual results reserve estimates may be different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered Reporting of Natural Gas and Natural Gas Liquids We produce NGLs as part of the processing of our natural gas The extraction of NGLs in the processing of natural gas reduces the volume of natural gas available for sale We report all natural gas production information net of the effect of any reduction in natural gas volumes resulting from the processing of NGLs We convert barrels to Mcfe using an energyequivalent ratio of six Mcf to one barrel of oil condensate or NGLs This energyequivalent ratio does not assume price equivalency and the energyequivalent prices for crude oil NGLs and natural gas may differ substantially Development of Proved Undeveloped Reserves Our PUDs were estimated by NSAI our independent petroleum consultant Future development costs associated with our PUDs at December 31 2020 were estimated at 942 million The following table presents changes in our PUDs in MMBoe December 31 2020 2019 2018 Proved undeveloped reserves beginning of year 236 170 120 Transfers to proved developed

Ship Shoal 028 and our Mahogany fields Activity related to PUDs in 2019  Successfully drilled and converted two locations and 05 MMBoe from PUD to proved developed with total capital expenditures of 271 million during 2019  Net PUD revisions of 71 MMBoe were primarily at our Ship Shoal 028 and our Mahogany fields We believe that we will be able to develop all b ut 23 MMBoe approximately 19 of the tot al 122 MMBoe classified as PUDs at December 31 2020 within five years from the date such PUDs were initially recorded The exceptions are at the Mississippi Canyon 243 field Matterhorn and Viosca Knoll 823 Virgo deepwater fields where future development drilling has been planned as sidetracks of existing wellbores due to conductor slot limitations and rig availability One sidetrack PUD location at each Matterhorn and Virgo will be delayed until an existing well are depleted and available to sidetrack We also plan to recomplete and convert an existing producer at Matterhorn to water injection for improved recovery following depletion of the existing well Based on the latest reserve report these PUD locations are expected to be developed in 2022 and 2024 28 Acreage The following

drilling and operations activity for 2020 and beyond we give consideration to undeveloped leasehold that may expire in the near term in order that we might retain the opportunity to extend such acreage Our net acreage decreased 41688 net acres 8 from December 31 2019 due to lease expirations and relinquishments partially offset by acquisitions Production For the years 2020 2019 and 2018 our net daily production averaged 42046 Boe 40634 Boe and 36510 Boe respectively Production increased in 2020 from 2019 primarily due a full year of production at the Mobile Bay properties  See

Operations  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Capital Expenditures under Part II Item 7 in this Form 10K for capital expenditure information 30 Item 3 Legal Proceedings Appeal with ONRR In 2009 we recognized allowable reductions of cash payments for royalties owed to the ONRR for transportation of their deepwater production through our subsea pipeline systems In 2010 the ONRR audited our calculations and support related to this usage fee and in 2010 we were notified that the ONRR had disallowed approximately 47 million of the reductions taken We recorded a reduction to other revenue in 2010 to reflect this disallowance with the offset to a liability reserve however we disagree with the position taken by the ONRR We filed an appeal with the ONRR which was denied in May 2014 On June 17 2014 we filed an appeal with the Interior Board of Land Appeals IBLA under the DOI On January 27 2017 the IBLA affirmed the decision of the ONRR requiring WT to pay approximately 47 million in additional royalties We filed a motion for reconsideration of the IBLA decision on March 27 2017 Based on a statutory deadline we filed an appeal of the IBLA decision on July 25 2017 in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana We were required to post a bond in the amount of 72 million and cash collateral of 69 million in order to appeal the IBLA decision On December 4 2018 the IBLA denied our motion for reconsideration On February 4 2019 we filed our first amended complaint and the government has filed its Answer in the Administrative Record On July 9 2019 we filed an Objection to the Administrative Record and Motion to Supplement the Administrative Record asking the court to order the government to file a complete privilege log with the record Following a hearing on July 31 2019 the Court ordered the government to file a complete privilege log In an Order dated December 18 2019 the court ordered the government to produce certain contracts subject to a protective order and to produce the remaining documents in dispute to the court for in camera review Ultimately the court upheld the governments assertion of privilege and the parties commenced briefing on the merits At this point both parties have filed crossmotions for summary judgment and opposition briefs WT has filed a Reply in support of its Motion for Summary Judgment and the government has in turn filed its Reply brief With briefing now completed we are waiting for the district courts ruling on the merits In January 2020 the cash collateral in the amount of 69 million securing the appeal bond in this matter was released to us In compliance with the ONRRs request for WT to increase the surety posted in the appeal the penal sum of the bond posted is currently 82 million Monetary Sanctions by Government Authorities Notices of Proposed Civil Penalty Assessment During 2020 and 2019 we did not pay any civil penalties to the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement BSEE related to Incidents of Noncompliance INCs at various offshore locations In January 2021 we executed a Settlement Agreement with BSEE which resolved nine pending civil penalties issued by BSEE The civil penalties pertained to INCs issued by BSEE alleging regulatory noncompliance at separate offshore locations on various dates between July 2012 and January 2018 with the proposed civil penalty amounts totaling 77 million Under the Settlement Agreement WT will pay a total of 720000 in three annual installments with the first installment due in March 2021 In addition WT committed to implement a Safety Improvement Plan with various deliverables due over a period ending in 2022 Other Claims We are a party to various pending or threatened claims and complaints seeking damages or other remedies concerning our commercial operations and other matters in the ordinary course of our business In addition claims or contingencies may arise related to matters occurring prior to our acquisition of properties or related to matters occurring subsequent to our sale of properties In certain cases we have indemnified the sellers of properties we have acquired and in other cases we have indemnified the buyers of properties we have sold We are also subject to federal and state administrative proceedings conducted in the ordinary course of business including matters related to alleged royalty underpayments on certain federalowned properties Although we can give no assurance about the outcome of pending legal and federal or state administrative proceedings and the effect such an outcome may have on us we believe that any ultimate liability resulting from the outcome of such proceedings to the extent not otherwise provided for or covered by insurance will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or liquidity See Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  Note 18  Contingencies under Part II Item 8 in this
