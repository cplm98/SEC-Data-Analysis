products We continue to implement new systems designed to provide improved quality reliability service greater efficiency and lower supply chain costs We also drive continuous improvement in product quality through process controls and validations supplier and distribution controls and then necessary training and tools for our operations team In addition we remain focused on examining our operations and general business activities to enhance our operational effectiveness by identifying costimprovement opportunities We remain committed to maintaining appropriate investments in supply chain resiliency on an ongoing basis Our products are designed and manufactured in technology centers around the world either by us or third parties We consistently monitor our inventory levels manufacturing and distribution capabilities and maintain recovery plans to address potential disruptions that we may encounter Supply chain resiliency also includes sterilization which is performed and optimized through a combination of internal and third party locations and may also be subject to potential interruptions Many components used in the manufacturing of our products are readily fabricated from commonly available raw materials or offtheshelf items available from multiple supply sources however certain items are custom made to meet our specifications We believe that in most cases redundant capacity exists at our suppliers and that alternative sources of supply are available or could be developed within a reasonable period of time We also have an ongoing program to identify singlesource components and to develop alternative backup supplies and we regularly readdress the adequacy and abilities of our suppliers and sterilizers to meet our needs 10 Quality Assurance We are committed to providing high quality products to our customers Our quality system starts with the initial product specification and continues through the design of the product component specification process and the manufacturing sale and servicing of the product Our quality system is intended to build in quality and process control and to utilize continuous improvement concepts throughout the product life These systems are designed to enable us to satisfy various international quality system regulations including those of the FDA with respect to products sold in the US All of our medical device manufacturing facilities and distribution centers are certified under the ISO 13485 quality system standard established by the International Standards Organization ISO for medical devices which includes requirements for an implemented quality system that applies to component quality supplier control product design and manufacturing operations This certification can be obtained only after a complete audit of a companys quality system by an independent outside auditor Maintenance of the certification requires that these facilities undergo periodic reexamination Environmental Regulation and Management We are subject to various environmental laws directives and regulations both in the US and abroad Our operations involve the use of substances regulated under environmental laws primarily in manufacturing and sterilization processes We believe that strong performance across relevant environmental health and safety metrics enhances our competitive strength while benefiting our patients customers stockholders and employees We are focused on continuous improvement in these areas by reducing pollution depletion of natural resources and our overall environmental footprint Specifically we are working to optimize energy and resource usage ultimately reducing greenhouse gas emissions and waste We are listed on the FTSE4Good Corporate Social Responsibility Index managed by the Financial Times and the London Stock Exchange which measures the performance of companies that meet globally recognized standards of corporate responsibility This listing recognizes our dedication to those standards and it places us in a select group of companies with a demonstrated commitment to responsible business practices and sound environmental policies We also recognize the need to minimize the impact of the manufacturing of our products on the environment and have committed to carbon neutrality in our manufacturing and key distribution sites by 2030 We have obtained ISO 140012015 certifications at our major manufacturing plants and Tier 1 distribution centers around the world as well as our Corporate headquarters in Marlborough Massachusetts ISO 140012015 is a globally recognized standard for Environmental Management Systems established by the International Standards Organization which provides a voluntary framework to identify key environmental aspects associated with our business Using this environmental management system and the specific attributes of our certified locations in the US Ireland Costa Rica and the Netherlands we continue to improve our environmental performance and reduce our environmental footprint Competition We encounter significant competition across our product lines and in each market in which we sell our products and solutions some from companies that may have greater financial sales and marketing resources than we do Our primary competitors include Abbott Laboratories and Medtronic plc as well as a wide range of medical device companies that sell a single or limited number of competitive products or participate in only a specific market segment In certain countries we face competition from domestic medical device companies that may benefit from their status as local suppliers We also face competition from nonmedical device companies which may offer alternative therapies for disease states that could also be treated using our products or from companies offering technologies that could augment or replace procedures using our products We believe that our products and solutions compete primarily on their ability to deliver both clinical and economic outcomes for our customers by enabling physicians to perform diagnostic and therapeutic procedures safely and effectively often in a lessinvasive manner We also compete on ease of use comparative effectiveness reliability and physician familiarity In the current environment of managed care with economicallymotivated buyers consolidation among healthcare providers increasing prevalence and importance of regional and national tenders increased competition and declining reimbursement rates we have been increasingly required to compete on the basis of price value reliability and efficiency We believe the current global economic conditions and healthcare reform measures could continue to put additional competitive pressure on us including on our average selling prices overall procedure rates and addressable market sizes We recognize that our continued competitive success will depend upon our ability to  offer products and solutions that provide differentiated clinical and economic outcomes  create or acquire innovative scientifically advanced technologies  apply our technology and solutions costeffectively and with superior quality across product lines and markets  develop or acquire proprietary products and solutions 11  attract and retain skilled personnel  obtain patent or other protection for our products  obtain required regulatory and reimbursement approvals  compete in regional and national tenders for our products  continually enhance our quality systems  manufacture and market our products and solutions either directly or through third parties and  supply sufficient inventory to meet customer demand Medical Device Regulatory Approvals The medical devices that we manufacture and market are subject to regulation by numerous worldwide regulatory bodies including the FDA and comparable international regulatory agencies These agencies require manufacturers of medical devices to comply with applicable laws and regulations governing development testing manufacturing labeling marketing and distribution Medical devices are also generally subject to varying levels of regulatory control based on risk level of the device In the US authorization to distribute a new device can generally be met in one of three ways The first process requires that a premarket notification 510k be made to the FDA to demonstrate that the device is as safe and effective as or substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device the predicate device Applicants must submit performance data to establish substantial equivalence In some instances data from human clinical trials must also be submitted in support of a 510k premarket notification If so these data must be collected in a manner that conforms to the applicable Investigational Device Exemption IDE regulations The FDA must issue a decision finding substantial equivalence before commercial distribution can occur Changes to cleared devices that could not significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device can generally be made without additional 510k premarket notifications otherwise a new 510k is required The second process requires the submission of a premarket approval PMA application to the FDA to demonstrate that the device is safe and effective for its intended use This approval process applies to most Class III devices and generally requires clinical data to support the safety and effectiveness of the device obtained in adherence with IDE requirements The FDA will approve the PMA application if it finds that there is a reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended purpose and that the proposed manufacturing is in compliance with the Quality System Regulation QSR For novel technologies the FDA will generally seek input from an advisory panel of medical experts and seek their views on the safety effectiveness and benefitrisk of the device The PMA process is generally more detailed lengthier and more expensive than the 510k process The third process requires that an application for a Humanitarian Device Exemption HDE be made to the FDA for the use of a Humanitarian Use Device HUD A HUD is intended to benefit patients by treating or diagnosing a disease or condition that affects or is manifested in not more than 8000 individuals in the US per year The application submitted to the FDA for an HDE is similar in both form and content to a PMA application but is exempt from the effectiveness requirements of a PMA The HUD provision of the regulation provides an incentive for the development of devices for use in the treatment or diagnosis of diseases affecting smaller patient populations In the European Union EU we will be required to comply with the new Medical Device Regulation MDR or EU MDR effective May 2020 which will supersede the current Medical Device Directives Medical devices which have a valid CE Certificate to the current Directives issued before May 2020 can continue to be sold until May 2024 or until the CE Certificate expires whichever comes first providing there are no significant changes to the design or intended use The MDR was published in May 2017 with a 3year transition period The CE Mark required to sell medical devices in the EU is affixed following conformity assessment and either approval from the appointed independent Notified Body or through selfcertification by the manufacturer The selected pathway to CE marking is based on product risk classification CE Marking indicates conformity to the applicable Essential Requirements of the relevant Medical Devices Directive and in the future to the General Safety and Performance Requirements for the new MDR The MDR will change multiple aspects of the existing regulatory framework for CE marking such as increased clinical evidence requirements and other new requirements including Unique Device Identification UDI as well as many other postmarket obligations MDR also significantly modifies and increases the compliance requirements for the industry and will require significant investment over the next few years to implement We are also required to comply with the regulations of every other country where we commercialize products before we can launch or maintain new products on the market such as the requirements that we obtain approval from the Japanese Ministry of Health Labor and Welfare MHLW the Japanese Pharmaceutical  Medical Device Agency PMDA and the China Food and Drug Administration NMPA Many countries that previously did not have medical device regulations or had minimal regulations are now introducing them For example India is in the process of expanding its current regulations to include all medical device categories while many countries in the Middle East and Southeast Asia are introducing new regulations 12 The FDA and other worldwide regulatory agencies and competent authorities actively monitor compliance to local laws and regulations through review and inspection of design and manufacturing practices recordkeeping reporting of adverse events labeling and promotional practices The FDA can ban certain medical devices detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices order repair replacement or refund of these devices and require notification of health professionals and others with regard to medical devices that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health The FDA may also enjoin and restrain a company for certain violations of the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Safe Medical Devices Act pertaining to medical devices or initiate action for criminal prosecution of such violations Regulatory agencies and authorities in the countries where we do business can halt production in or distribution within their respective country or otherwise take action in accordance with local laws and regulations International sales of medical devices manufactured in the US that are not approved by the FDA for use in the US or that are banned or deviate from lawful performance standards are subject to FDA export requirements Additionally exported devices are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country to which the device is exported Some countries do not have medical device regulations but in most foreign countries medical devices are regulated Frequently regulatory approval may first be obtained in a foreign country prior to application in the US due to differing regulatory requirements however other countries such as China for example require approval in the country of origin first Most countries outside of the US require that product approvals be recertified on a regular basis generally every five years The recertification process requires that we evaluate any device changes and any new regulations or standards relevant to the device and where needed conduct appropriate testing to document continued compliance Where recertification applications are required they must be approved in order to continue selling our products in those countries Government Affairs We maintain a global Government Affairs presence headquartered in Washington DC to actively monitor and advocate on myriad legislation and policies impacting us both on a domestic and an international front The Government Affairs office works closely with members of Congress and committee staff the White House and Administration offices state Governors legislatures and regulatory agencies embassies and global governments on issues affecting our business Our proactive approach and depth of political and policy expertise are aimed at having our positions heard by federal state and global decisionmakers to improve patient care and to advance our business objectives by educating policymakers on our positions key priorities and the value of our technologies The Government Affairs office manages our political action committee and works closely with trade groups on issues affecting our industry and healthcare in general The Government Affairs office also advocates for public policy that benefits our employees and the patients we serve and supports the communities in which we live Healthcare Policies and Reimbursement Political economic and regulatory influences around the world continue to subject the healthcare industry to potential fundamental changes that could substantially affect our results of operations Government and private sector initiatives related to limiting the growth of healthcare costs including price regulation coverage and payment policies comparative effectiveness reviews of therapies technology assessments and healthcare delivery structure reforms are continuing in many countries where we do business We believe that these changes are causing the marketplace to put increased emphasis on the delivery of treatments that can reduce costs improve efficiencies andor increase patient access Although we believe our lessinvasive products and technologies generate favorable clinical outcomes value and cost efficiency the resources necessary to demonstrate value to our customers patients payers and other stakeholders are significant and new therapies now take longer periods of time to gain widespread adoption The impact to our business of the US Patient Protection and Affordable Care Acts ACA provisions related to coverage expansion payment reforms and delivery system has been immaterial The ACA and Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act were enacted into law in the US in 2010 The legislation imposed on medical device manufacturers a 23 percent excise tax on US sales of Class I II and III medical devices beginning in January 2013 In December 2015 the Promise for Antibiotics and Therapeutics for Health Act or PATH Act was passed which included legislation which temporarily suspended the 23 percent excise tax until December 31 2017 In January 2018 another temporary twoyear suspension of the 23 percent excise tax was passed extending the suspension to December 31 2019 On December 20 2019 the President signed the 2020 spending bill which included a provision to permanently repeal the excise tax The US Federal government as part of the ACA and certain state governments have enacted laws aimed at increasing transparency or sunshine in relationships between medical device biologics and pharmaceutical companies and healthcare professionals HCPs As a result we are required by law to report many types of payments and transfers of value provided to HCPs Certain foreign jurisdictions have similar laws or are currently acting to implement similar laws Failure to comply with sunshine laws andor implement and adhere to adequate policies and practices to address changes to legal and regulatory requirements could 13 have a negative impact on our results of operations Additional legislation at the state and federal levels may result in further changes to these laws As noted below we expect certain trends to continue placing pressure on pricing and utilization in the US The Tax Cuts and Jobs Acts TCJA enacted December 22 2017 in the US changed the tax treatment of healthcare expenses and repealed the individual mandate to purchase private insurance These tax law changes have resulted in changes to insurance coverage and financing of insurance coverage in individual markets Additional legislation may result in changes to government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid In addition the current US Administration has enacted a number of administrative policy changes that will likely result in additional changes to insurance coverage financing of insurance coverage and benefits offered through private insurance in both the employersponsored and individual markets These changes and other similar changes being considered are likely to lead to an increase in the number of people without insurance Other individual coverage policies will be less generous than those required under the ACA The impact of these changes on coverage levels and patient costsharing could affect utilization of nonurgent nonacute services in which our devices are used We expect that pricing of medical devices will remain under pressure as alternative payment reform such as prospective payment systems for hospital care preferential site of service payments valuebased purchasing and accountable care organizations ACOs continue to take shape globally We also expect marketplace changes to place pressure on medical device pricing globally as hospitals consolidate and large group purchasing organizations hospital networks and other groups continue to seek to aggregate purchasing power Similarly governments are increasing the use of tenders placing pressure on medical device pricing Some governments also seek to limit the growth of healthcare costs through price regulation Implementation of cost containment initiatives and healthcare reforms in significant markets such as the US Japan and Europe and other markets may limit the price of or the level at which reimbursement is provided for our products which in turn may influence a hospitals or physicians selection of products used to treat patients Our products are purchased principally by hospitals physicians and other healthcare providers around the world that typically bill various thirdparty payers including government programs eg Medicare and Medicaid in the US and private insurance payers for the services provided to their patients Thirdparty payers and governments may approve or deny coverage for certain technologies and associated procedures based on independently determined assessment criteria Coverage decisions by payers for these technologies and associated procedures are based on a wide range of methodologies that may reflect the assessed resource costs clinical outcomes and economic value of the technologies and associated procedures Proprietary Rights and Patent Litigation We rely on a combination of patents trademarks trade secrets and other forms of intellectual property to protect our proprietary rights We generally file patent applications in the US and foreign countries where patent protection for our technology is appropriate and available As of December 31 2019  we held more than 21000 patents and had approximately 6000 patent applications pending worldwide that cover various aspects of our technology In addition we hold exclusive and nonexclusive licenses to a variety of thirdparty technologies covered by patents and patent applications In the aggregate these intellectual property assets and licenses are of material importance to our business however we believe that no single patent technology trademark intellectual property asset or license is material in relation to our business as a whole We rely on nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements with employees consultants and other parties to protect in part trade secrets and other proprietary technology There has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry particularly in the areas in which we compete We continue to defend ourselves against claims and legal actions alleging infringement of the patent rights of others Additionally we may find it necessary to initiate litigation to enforce our patent rights to protect our trade secrets or knowhow and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others Accordingly we may seek to settle some or all of our pending litigation particularly to manage risk over time Settlement may include cross licensing of the patents that are the subject of the litigation as well as our other intellectual property and may involve monetary payments to or from third parties We maintain insurance policies providing limited coverage against securities claims We are substantially selfinsured with respect to product liability claims and fully selfinsured with respect to intellectual property infringement claims The absence of significant thirdparty insurance coverage increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims or adverse decisions See Note J  Commitments and Contingencies to our 2019 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report for a discussion of intellectual property product liability and other litigation and proceedings in which we are involved 14 Employees As of December 31 2019  we had approximately 36000 employees including approximately 14000 in operations 11000 in selling marketing and distribution 7000 in administration and 4000 in clinical regulatory and research and development Of these employees we employed approximately 19000 outside the US approximately 9000 of whom are in the manufacturing operations function Community Outreach We are united by a goal to make a difference in the lives of the over 30 million patients we serve annually We seek to give our time and resources to make positive impacts upon those communities where we live work and serve Guided by our core values we seek to improve access to healthcare to invest in educational programming for students with limited means and access to opportunities and to support and embrace the spirit of volunteerism within our global workforce while adhering to strong ethical standards In some parts of the world access to health information screening care and services can be limited Our collaborations with nonprofit community organizations raise awareness of chronic disease and decrease these health disparities by improving health outcomes for underserved populations We accomplish this through our focus on 3 Ps  Prevent Provide and Prepare We work to prevent chronic disease through education and awareness provide access to healthcare through increasing the quantity and quality of healthcare workers and screenings and preparing and empowering children at high risk of chronic disease to successfully navigate their health journey Each year our employees play a role in how we reach our health goals by participating in health awareness campaigns like Wear Red Day for heart health No Shave November for mens health and in walks and runs for various health causes For the last three years Boston Scientific partnered with Project HOPE a global health and humanitarian relief organization to fund the United Dialogue and Action Against NonCommunicable Disorders UDAAN program to help reduce premature mortality in India The program focuses on improving the health practices related to chronic disease treatment and care Through the program a chronic disease tool kit was developed to improve healthcare worker efficiencies and is now being scaled to other Health and Wellness centers in the area We are also passionate about inspiring young learners to see themselves in a Science Technology Engineering and Math STEM role in the future Our employees work with underrepresented K12 students around the world and share their passion for STEM by providing interactive product demos development programs and handson activities for young learners in their communities A key effort of our STEM volunteers is to create resources that empower other employees to get involved While each regional team focuses on what is needed most by students in their local communities they also work together to share best practices that ensure we reach our overall goals Resources like presentations STEM kits interactive displays and an online activity database have been created to increase global collaboration and overall impact In 2019 our employee volunteers participated in more than 160 STEM events and school programs Through this outreach we are helping to develop the diverse future talent that will enable Boston Scientific to create innovative health solutions for generations to come Beyond the classroom we empower our employees to participate in and influence the way we care for people in their local communities We are proud of these efforts and the collective impact we have on advancing possibilities across the globe In 2019 our employees volunteered more than 41000 hours to make a positive impact at more than 600 global community events in 38 countries We also support the US communities where we have significant business presences through the Boston Scientific Foundation The mission of the foundation is simple to help expand access to quality healthcare and educational opportunities for underserved populations The Boston Scientific Foundation awarded approximately 1 million dollars in scholarships to children of employees and grant awards across the US in 2019 The process involved more than 70 employee volunteers who evaluated proposals for the Boston Scientific Foundation Board review and approval upon which the Boston Scientific Foundation was able to help fuel grassroots innovative solutions to improve access to quality healthcare and create new opportunities for students to learn and achieve Seasonality Our net sales are influenced by many factors including product launches acquisitions regulatory and reimbursement approvals patient physician and employee holiday schedules and other macroeconomic conditions While our consolidated net sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality customer purchases of our medical devices have historically been lower in the first and third quarters of the year 15

19 ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS In addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report and the exhibits hereto the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business Our business financial condition cash flows or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks This section contains forwardlooking statements You should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forwardlooking statements set forth at the end of Item 1 Business of this Annual Report Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business financial condition cash flows or results of operations Business and Operational Risks We face intense competition and may not be able to keep pace with the rapid technological changes in the medical devices industry which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations The medical device markets in which we participate are highly competitive We encounter significant competition across our product lines and in each market in which our products are sold from various medical device companies Some of our competitors may have greater financial and marketing resources than we do including as a result of consolidation among companies in our industry Our primary competitors include Abbott Laboratories and Medtronic plc  as well as a wide range of medical device companies that sell a single or limited number of competitive products or which participate in only a specific market segment or set of segments We also face competition from nonmedical device companies including pharmaceutical companies which may offer alternative therapies for disease states also amenable to treatment using our products New direct or indirect competitors may emerge in the future potentially including companies introducing new sales or distribution models to our industry or leveraging robotic navigation andor other automation technologies into markets in which we compete In addition the medical device markets in which we participate are characterized by extensive research and development and rapid technological change Developments by other companies of products andor services processes or technologies may make our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive and may negatively impact our net sales It is necessary for us to devote continued efforts and financial resources to the development or acquisition of scientifically advanced technologies and products In addition we will need to apply our technologies costeffectively across product lines and markets obtain patent and other protection for our technologies and products obtain required regulatory and reimbursement approvals and successfully manufacture and market our products consistent with our quality standards If we fail to develop or acquire new products or enhance existing products such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations In addition a delay in the timing of the launch of nextgeneration products and the overall performance of and continued physician confidence in those products may result in declines in our market share and have an adverse impact on our business financial condition or results of operations We may experience declines in market size average selling prices for our products medical procedure volumes and our share of the markets in which we compete which may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition We continue to experience pressures across many of our businesses due to competitive activity increased market power of our customers as the healthcare industry consolidates economic pressures experienced by our customers public perception of our products and the impact of managed care organizations and other thirdparty payers These and other factors may adversely impact market sizes as well as our share of the markets in which we compete the average selling prices for our products or medical procedure volumes There can be no assurance that the size of the markets in which we compete will increase above existing levels that we will be able to regain or gain market share or compete effectively on the basis of price or that the number of procedures in which our products are used will increase above existing levels Decreases in market sizes or our market share and declines in average selling prices or procedural volumes could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition Continued consolidation in the healthcare industry or additional governmental controls exerted over pricing in key markets could lead to increased demands for price concessions or limit or eliminate our ability to sell to certain of our significant market segments which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations Numerous initiatives and reforms by legislators regulators and thirdparty payers to curb the rising cost of healthcare have catalyzed a consolidation of aggregate purchasing power within the markets in which we sell our products Additionally a growing number of countries have instituted or are contemplating introducing regional or national tender processes driven primarily by price In some cases such processes may favor local companies to multinational companies like Boston Scientific As the healthcare industry consolidates competition to provide products and services is expected to continue to intensify resulting in pricing pressures decreased average selling prices and the exclusion of certain suppliers from important market segments We expect that market demand government regulation thirdparty coverage and reimbursement policies government contracting requirements and 20 societal pressures will continue to change the worldwide healthcare industry resulting in further business consolidations and alliances among our customers which may increase competition exert further downward pressure on the prices of our products and services and may adversely impact our business financial condition or results of operations Healthcare cost containment pressures government payment and delivery system reforms changes in private payer policies and marketplace consolidations could decrease the demand for our products the prices which customers are willing to pay for those products andor the number of procedures performed using our devices which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations Our products are purchased principally by hospitals physicians and other healthcare providers around the world that typically bill various thirdparty payers including government programs authorities or agencies eg Medicare and Medicaid in the US and private health plans for the healthcare services provided to their patients Governments and payers may also institute changes in healthcare delivery systems that may reduce funding for services or encourage greater scrutiny of healthcare costs The ability of customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for their products and services from private and governmental thirdparty payers is critical to the success of medical technology companies because it affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay Reimbursement and funding vary by country and can significantly impact the acceptance of new products and technologies and the use of established products and technologies Even if we develop a promising new product we may find limited demand for the product unless reimbursement approval is obtained from private and governmental thirdparty payers Further legislative or administrative reforms to the reimbursement systems in the US Japan or other countries in a manner that significantly reduces reimbursement for procedures using our medical devices or denies coverage for those procedures including price regulation site of service requirements competitive bidding and tendering coverage and payment policies comparative effectiveness of therapies heightened clinical data requirements technology assessments and managedcare arrangements could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations We are subject to a number of market business financial legal and regulatory risks and uncertainties with respect to our international operations that could have a material impact on our business financial condition or results of operations International net sales accounted for 42 percent of our global net sales in 2019  An important part of our strategy is to continue pursuing growth opportunities in net sales and market share outside of the US by expanding global presence including in Emerging Markets Our international operations are subject to a number of market business and financial risks and uncertainties including those related to our use of channel partners geopolitical and economic instability foreign currency exchange and interest rate fluctuations competitive product offerings local changes in healthcare financing and payment systems and healthcare delivery systems local product preferences and requirements including preferences for local manufacturers workforce instability weaker intellectual property protection in certain countries than exists in the US and longer accounts receivable cycles Such risks and uncertainties may adversely impact our ability to implement our growth strategy in these markets and as a result our sales growth market share and operating profits from our international operations may be adversely affected Our international operations are subject to established and developing legal and regulatory requirements for medical devices in each country in which our products are marketed and sold Most foreign countries have medical device regulations Further most countries outside of the US require product approvals be renewed or recertified on a regular basis in order to continue to be marketed and sold there In addition several countries that previously did not have regulatory requirements for medical devices have established such requirements in recent years and other countries have expanded or plan to expand existing regulations including requiring local clinical data in addition to global clinical data These factors have caused or may cause us to experience more uncertainty risk expense and delay in commercializing products in certain foreign jurisdictions which could affect our ability to obtain approvals for our products in those jurisdictions and adversely impact our net sales market share and operating profits from our international operations Further international markets are affected by economic pressure to contain healthcare costs which can lead to more rigorous evidence requirements and lower reimbursement rates for either our products directly or procedures in which our products are used Governments and payers may also institute changes in healthcare delivery systems that may reduce funding for services or encourage greater scrutiny of healthcare costs In addition certain international markets may also be affected by foreign government efforts to reference reimbursement rates in other countries All of these types of changes may ultimately reduce selling prices of our products andor reduce the number of procedures in which our products are used which may adversely impact our net sales market share and operating profits from our international operations In addition our international operations are subject to other established and developing US and foreign legal and regulatory requirements including FCPA andor similar laws in other countries and US and foreign import and export controls and licensing requirements trade protection and embargo measures and customs laws Global businesses including those in the medical device industry are facing increasing scrutiny of and heightened enforcement efforts with respect to their international operations Any 21 alleged or actual failure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements may subject us to government scrutiny civil andor criminal proceedings sanctions and other liabilities which may have a material adverse effect on our international operations financial condition results of operations andor liquidity In a referendum on June 23 2016 voters approved the exit of the United Kingdom UK from the European Union EU Following a formal notification by the UK to the EU that it intends to leave the EU and after several extensions to the deadline for doing so agreed between the UK and the EU the UK legally withdrew from the EU on January 31 2020 Pursuant to the withdrawal agreement entered into on January 24 2020 the UK will maintain access to the single EU market and to the global trade deals negotiated by the EU on behalf of its members and remain subject to EU for a transition period ending on December 31 2020 Exit of the UK from the EU will have numerous consequences in all areas of our business including economic regulatory and operational and the actual impact is very difficult to assess at this time Changes in industry regulations could have an effect on existing CE certificates being renewed and new certificates being issued which would impact the ability to trade however it is impossible to assess the full impact at this stage At this stage the materiality to us of Brexit remains unknown and unquantifiable However we have implemented a Brexit Response Team and have put in place mitigation procedures to reduce any significant operational risks that have been identified to date Any significant changes in the political and economic financial competitive legal and regulatory or reimbursement conditions where we conduct or plan to expand our international operations may have a material impact on our business financial condition or results of operations If we are unable to manage our debt levels maintain investment grade credit ratings at the three ratings agencies or experience a disruption in our cash flows it could have an adverse effect on our cost of borrowing financial condition or results of operations As part of our strategy to maximize stockholder value we use financial leverage to manage our cost of capital Our outstanding debt balance was 10008 billion as of December 31 2019 and 7056 billion as of December 31 2018  Although we currently have investment grade ratings at Moodys Investor Service Standard  Poors Rating Service and Fitch Ratings our inability to maintain investment grade credit ratings could increase our cost of borrowing funds in the future and reduce our access to liquidity Delays in our product development and new product launches could result in disruption in our cash flow or our ability to continue to effectively manage our debt levels could have an adverse effect on our cost of borrowing financial condition or results of operations In addition our credit and security facilities contain covenants that require us to maintain specified financial ratios and place other limits on our business If we are unable to satisfy these covenants we may be required to obtain waivers from our lenders and no assurance can be made that our lenders would grant such waivers on favorable terms or at all and we could be required to repay any borrowings on demand We may record future intangible asset impairment charges related to one or more of our global reporting units which could materially adversely impact our results of operations We test our goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist We assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and in evaluating the potential for impairment of goodwill we make assumptions regarding estimated revenue projections growth rates cash flows and discount rates In the second quarter of 2019 we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for all of our reporting units existing at the time In conjunction with our annual test the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and none of our reporting units were at risk of impairment Refer to Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates contained in Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Annual Report for a discussion of key assumptions used in our testing On a quarterly basis we monitor the key drivers of fair value to detect events or other changes that would warrant an interim impairment test of our goodwill and other intangible assets Relatively small declines in the future performance and cash flows of a reporting unit or asset group changes in our reporting units or in the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations acquisitions or divestitures of assets or businesses or small changes in other key assumptions may result in the recognition of significant asset impairment charges which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations Failure to integrate acquired businesses into our operations successfully could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results As part of our strategy to realign our business portfolio we have completed multiple acquisitions over the past three years and may pursue additional acquisitions in the future Our integration of acquired businesses requires significant efforts including 22 corporate restructuring and the coordination of information technologies research and development sales and marketing operations regulatory supply chain manufacturing quality systems and finance These efforts result in additional expenses and involve significant management time Some of the factors that could affect the success of our acquisitions include among others the effectiveness of our due diligence process our ability to execute our business plan for the acquired companies the strength of the acquired technology results of clinical trials regulatory approvals and reimbursement levels of the acquired products and related procedures the continued performance of critical transition services our ability to adequately fund acquired inprocess research and development projects and retain key employees and our ability to achieve synergies with our acquired companies such as increasing sales of our products achieving cost savings and effectively combining technologies to develop new products In addition foreign acquisitions involve unique risks including those related to integration of operations across different geographies cultures and languages currency risks and risks associated with the economic political legal and regulatory environment in specific countries Our failure to manage successfully and coordinate the growth of the acquired companies could have an adverse impact on our business and our future growth In addition we cannot be certain that the businesses we acquire will become profitable or remain so and if our acquisitions are not successful we may record related asset impairment charges in the future or experience other negative consequences on our results We may not be successful in our strategy relating to future strategic acquisitions of investments in or alliances with other companies and businesses which have been a significant source of historical growth for us and will be key to our diversification into new markets and technologies Our strategic acquisitions investments and alliances are intended to further expand our ability to offer customers effective high quality medical devices that satisfy their interventional needs These acquisitions investments and alliances have been a significant source of our growth If we are unsuccessful in our acquisitions investments and alliances we may be unable to grow our business The success of our strategy relating to future acquisitions investments or alliances will depend on a number of factors including  our ability to identify suitable opportunities for acquisition investment or alliance if at all  our ability to manage acquisition investment or alliance opportunities within our capital capacity and prioritize those investments to execute on our strategy  our ability to manage our due diligence process to uncover potential issues with targets  our ability to finance any future acquisition investment or alliance on terms acceptable to us if at all  our ability to complete acquisitions investments or alliances in a timely manner on terms that are satisfactory to us if at all  our ability to successfully integrate and operate acquired businesses  our ability to successfully identify and retain key target employees  our ability to comply with applicable laws and regulations including foreign laws and regulations and  our ability to protect intellectual property and to prevail in litigation related to newly acquired technologies Any potential future acquisitions we consummate may be dilutive to our earnings and may require additional debt or equity financing depending on their size or nature We may not realize the expected benefits from our restructuring and optimization initiatives our longterm expense reduction programs may result in an increase in shortterm expenses and our efforts may lead to unintended consequences We monitor the dynamics of the economy the healthcare industry and the markets in which we compete and assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency and to better align expenses with revenues while preserving our ability to make investments in research and development projects capital and our people that we believe are important to our longterm success As a result of these assessments we have undertaken restructuring and optimization initiatives in order to enhance our growth potential and position us for longterm success In November 2018 we announced a restructuring initiative the 2019 Restructuring Plan intended to support our effort to improve operating performance and meet anticipated market demands by ensuring that we are appropriately structured and resourced to deliver sustainable value to patients and customers Key activities under the 2019 Restructuring Plan include supply chain network optimization intended to maximize our global manufacturing and distribution network capacity and building functional capabilities that support business growth These activities were initiated in 2019 with the majority of activity expected to be complete by the end of 2021 The 2019 Restructuring Plan is expected to result in total pretax charges of approximately 200 million to 300 million and reduce gross annual pretax operating expenses by approximately 100 million to 150 million by the end of 2022 as program benefits are realized We expect a substantial portion of the savings to be reinvested in strategic growth initiatives These measures could yield unintended consequences such as distraction of our management and employees business disruption inability to attract or retain key personnel and reduced employee productivity which could negatively affect our business sales financial condition and results of operations Moreover our restructuring and optimization initiatives result in charges and expenses some of which impact our operating results We cannot 23 guarantee that the activities under our restructuring plans or other optimization initiatives will result in the desired efficiencies and estimated cost savings Current domestic and international economic conditions could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations Uncertainty about global economic conditions including those resulting from credit and sovereign debt issues has caused and may continue to cause disruption in the financial markets including diminished liquidity and credit availability These conditions may adversely affect our suppliers leading them to experience financial difficulties or be unable to borrow money to fund their operations which could cause disruptions in our ability to produce our products Our customers may experience financial difficulties or be unable to borrow money to fund their operations which may adversely impact their ability or decision to purchase our products particularly capital equipment or to pay for our products that they purchase on a timely basis if at all In addition we have accounts receivable factoring programs in certain European and Asian countries Continued deterioration of the global economy or increase in sovereign debt issues may impact our ability to transfer receivables to third parties in certain of those countries in the future Third parties such as banks offering factoring programs in these countries are looking to reduce their exposure levels to government owned or supported debt This could result in terminations of or changes to the costs or credit limits of our existing factoring programs Such terminations or changes could have a negative impact on our cash flow and days sales outstanding The strength and timing of economic recovery remains uncertain and there can be no assurance that there will not be further deterioration in the global economy Accordingly we cannot predict to what extent global economic conditions including sovereign debt issues and increased focus on healthcare systems and costs in the US and abroad may continue to impact negatively our average selling prices net sales and profit margins procedural volumes and reimbursement rates from third party payers In addition conditions in the financial markets and other factors beyond our control may adversely affect our ability to borrow money in the credit markets access the capital markets and to obtain financing for acquisitions or other general corporate and commercial purposes Our future growth is dependent upon the development of new products and enhancement of existing products which requires significant research and development clinical trials and regulatory approvals all of which may be very expensive and timeconsuming and may not result in commercially viable products In order to develop new products and enhance existing products we focus our research and development programs largely on the development of nextgeneration and novel technology offerings across multiple programs and businesses The development of new products and enhancement of existing products requires significant investment in research and development clinical trials and regulatory approvals The results of our product development efforts may be affected by a number of factors including our ability to anticipate customer needs innovate and develop new products complete clinical trials obtain regulatory approvals and reimbursement in the United States and abroad manufacture products in a costeffective manner obtain appropriate intellectual property protection for our products and gain and maintain market approval of our products There can be no assurance that any products now in development or that we may seek to develop in the future will achieve technological feasibility obtain regulatory approval or gain market acceptance If we are unable to develop and launch new products and enhanced products our ability to maintain or expand our market position in the markets in which we participate may be materially adversely impacted Further we are continuing to investigate and have completed several acquisitions that involve opportunities to further expand our presence in and diversify into priority growth areas by accessing new products and technologies There can be no assurance that our investments will be successful or that we will be able to access new products and technologies on terms favorable to us or that these products and technologies will achieve commercial feasibility obtain regulatory approval or gain market acceptance A delay in the development or approval of new products and technologies or our decision to reduce our investments may adversely impact the contribution of these technologies to our future growth Additionally certain products or groups of products in particular new products or enhancements of existing products may have a disproportionate impact on our business financial condition and results of operations Failure to meet growth projections poor clinical outcomes increasing regulatory requirements launch delays and inability to effectively scale manufacturing and achieve targeted margins with respect to any of these products or groups of products in particular may materially adversely impact on our business financial condition and results of operations Natural disasters public health crises and other catastrophic events or other events outside of our control may affect sales of our products or disrupt our supply chain and have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations If any of our facilities or the facilities of our suppliers or customers is affected by natural disasters public health crises such as pandemics and epidemics or other events outside of our control our business and operating results could suffer These types of 24 events could negatively impact procedure volumes in the affected regions or depending upon the severity globally which could adversely impact our operating results For example we anticipate that the novel coronavirus may have a negative sales impact due to the potential effect on procedure volumes in China and supply chain disruption Interruption of our manufacturing operations could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition Our products are designed and manufactured in technology centers around the world either by us or third parties In most cases the manufacturing of any specific product is concentrated in one or a few locations Factors such as a failure to follow specific internal protocols and procedures equipment malfunction environmental factors or damage to one or more of our facilities could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products In the event of an interruption in manufacturing we may be unable to quickly move to alternate means of producing affected products or to meet customer demand In the event of a significant interruption for example as a result of a failure to follow regulatory protocols and procedures we may experience lengthy delays in resuming production of affected products due primarily to needs for regulatory approvals As a result we may experience loss of market share which we may be unable to recapture and harm to our reputation which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition Disruptions in the supply of the materials and components used in manufacturing our products or the sterilization of our products by thirdparty vendors could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition We purchase the majority of the materials and components used in manufacturing our products from thirdparty vendors Certain of these materials and components are purchased from single sources due to quality considerations expertise costs or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements In certain cases we may not be able to establish additional or replacement vendors for such materials or components in a timely or cost effective manner largely as a result of FDA regulations that require validation of materials and components prior to their use in our products and the complex nature of our and many of our vendors manufacturing processes A reduction or interruption in the supply of materials and components used in manufacturing our products an inability to timely develop and validate alternative sources if required or a significant increase in the price of such materials or components could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition In addition many of our products require sterilization prior to sale and we utilize a mix of internal resources and contract sterilizers to perform this service To the extent we or our contract sterilizers are unable to sterilize our products whether due to capacity availability of materials for sterilization regulatory or other constraints including federal and state regulations on the use of ethylene oxide we may be unable to transition to other internal resources contract sterilizers sterilizer locations or sterilization methods in a timely or cost effective manner or at all which could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition Our share price has been volatile and may fluctuate and accordingly the value of an investment in our common stock may also fluctuate Stock markets in general and our common stock in particular have experienced significant price and trading volume volatility over recent years The market price and trading volume of our common stock may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations due to factors described under this Item 1A Risk Factors  as well as economic and geopolitical conditions in general and to variability in the prevailing sentiment regarding our operations or business prospects as well as among other things changing investment priorities of our stockholders Because the market price of our common stock fluctuates significantly stockholders may not be able sell their shares at attractive prices If we are unable to attract or retain key personnel it could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results from operations In our industry there is substantial competition for key personnel in the regions in which we operate and we may face increased competition for such employees particularly in emerging markets as the trend toward globalization continues Our business depends to a significant extent on the continued service of senior management and other key personnel the development of additional management personnel and the hiring of new qualified employees There can be no assurance that we will be successful in retaining and developing existing personnel or recruiting new personnel The loss of one or more key employees our ability to attract or develop additional qualified employees or any delay in hiring key personnel could have material adverse effects on our business financial condition or results of operations 25 Legal and Regulatory Risk Factors Healthcare policy changes including healthcare reform legislation may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows Political economic and policy influences are leading the healthcare industry to make substantial structural and financial changes that will continue affecting our results of operations Government and private sector initiatives limiting the growth of healthcare costs including price regulation coverage and payment policies comparative effectiveness of therapies technology assessments and healthcare delivery structure reforms are continuing in many countries where we do business We believe that these changes are causing the marketplace to put increased emphasis on the delivery of more treatments that can reduce costs improve efficiencies andor increase patient access Although we believe our lessinvasive products and technologies generate favorable clinical outcomes value and cost efficiency the resources necessary and evidence necessary to demonstrate value to our customers patients payers and other stakeholders may be significant and it may take a longer period of time to gain widespread adoption Moreover there can be no assurance that our strategies will succeed for every product The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ACA and Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 were enacted into law in the US in March 2010 As a US headquartered company with significant domestic sales the medical device tax included in this law has materially affected us The law imposed on medical device manufacturers a 23 percent excise tax on US sales of Class I II and III medical devices beginning in January 2013 In December 2015 this law was temporarily suspended until December 2019 when the law was permanently repealed as part of the 2020 fiscal spending bill Under the current administration there may be a permanent repeal or an alteration of other elements of the ACA but at this time it is not definite that a change will be enacted or what new healthcare provisions may be implemented While the implementation of the medical device tax has been repealed other provisions of this law including comparative effectiveness research pilot programs to evaluate alternative payment methodologies and other changes to the payment systems have started changing the way healthcare is delivered reimbursed and funded While the extent to which it has affected our business is not clear these changes over the longterm may adversely affect our business and results of operations We cannot predict the specific healthcare programs and regulations that will be ultimately implemented by regional and national governments globally However any changes that lower reimbursements for either our products andor procedures using our products reduce medical procedure volumes andor increase cost containment pressures on us or others in the healthcare sector could adversely affect our business and results of operations We are subject to extensive and dynamic medical device regulation which may impede or hinder the approval or sale of our products and in some cases may ultimately result in an inability to obtain approval of certain products or may result in the recall or seizure of previously approved products Our products marketing sales and development activities and manufacturing processes are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the FDA pursuant to the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act FDC Act by comparable agencies in foreign countries and by other regulatory agencies and governing bodies Under the FDC Act medical devices must receive FDA clearance or approval or an exemption from such clearance or approval before they can be commercially marketed in the US In the European Union EU we will be required to comply with the new Medical Device Regulation MDR or EU MDR effective May 2020 which will supersede the current Medical Device Directives Medical devices which have a valid CE Certificate to the current Directives issued before May 2020 can continue to be sold until May 2024 or until the CE Certificate expires whichever comes first providing there are no significant changes to the design or intended use The CE Mark is applied following approval from an independent notified body or declaration of conformity The process of obtaining marketing approval or clearance from the FDA or by comparable agencies in foreign countries for new products or with respect to enhancements or modifications to existing products could  take a significant period of time  require the expenditure of substantial resources  involve rigorous preclinical and clinical testing as well as increased postmarket surveillance  require changes to products and  result in limitations on the indicated uses of products In addition exported devices are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country to which the device is exported Some countries do not have medical device regulations but in most foreign countries medical devices are regulated Frequently regulatory approval may first be obtained in a foreign country prior to application in the US due to differing regulatory requirements however other countries such as China for example require approval in the country of origin or legal manufacturer first Most countries outside of the US require that product approvals be renewed or recertified on a regular basis generally every 26 four to five years The renewal or recertification process requires that we evaluate any device changes and any new regulations or standards relevant to the device and conduct appropriate testing to document continued compliance Where renewal or recertification applications are required they may need to be renewed andor approved in order to continue selling our products in those countries There can be no assurance that we will receive the required approvals for new products or modifications to existing products on a timely basis or that any approval will not be subsequently withdrawn or conditioned upon extensive postmarket study requirements Our global regulatory environment is becoming increasingly stringent and unpredictable which could increase the time cost and complexity of obtaining regulatory approvals for our products as well as the clinical and regulatory costs of supporting those approvals Several countries that did not have regulatory requirements for medical devices have established such requirements in recent years and other countries have expanded on existing regulations Certain regulators are exhibiting less flexibility and are requiring local preclinical and clinical data in addition to global data While harmonization of global regulations has been pursued requirements continue to differ significantly among countries We expect this global regulatory environment will continue to evolve which could impact our ability to obtain future approvals for our products or could increase the cost and time to obtain such approvals in the future The FDA and other worldwide regulatory agencies actively monitor compliance with local laws and regulations through review and inspection of design and manufacturing practices recordkeeping reporting of adverse events labeling and promotional practices The FDA can ban certain medical devices detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices order repair replacement or refund of these devices and require notification of health professionals and others with regard to medical devices that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health The FDA can take action against a company that promotes offlabel uses The FDA may also enjoin and restrain a company for certain violations of the FDC Act and other amending Acts pertaining to medical devices or initiate action for criminal prosecution of such violations Any adverse regulatory action depending on its magnitude may restrict a company from effectively marketing and selling its products may limit a companys ability to obtain future premarket clearances or approvals and could result in a substantial modification to our business practices and operations International sales of medical devices manufactured in the US that are not approved by the FDA for use in the US or that are banned or deviate from lawful performance standards are subject to FDA export requirements Regulations regarding the development manufacture and sale of medical devices are evolving and subject to future change We cannot predict what impact if any those changes might have on our business Failure to comply with regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or manufacturer could result in fines delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances or approvals seizures or recalls of products physician advisories or other field actions operating restrictions andor criminal prosecution We may also initiate field actions as a result of a failure to strictly comply with our internal quality policies The failure to receive product approval clearance on a timely basis suspensions of regulatory clearances seizures or recalls of products physician advisories or other field actions or the withdrawal of product approval by the FDA or by comparable agencies in foreign countries could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations Our products are continually subject to clinical trials and other analyses conducted by us our competitors or other third parties the results of which may be unexpected or perceived as unfavorable by the market and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations As a part of the regulatory process of obtaining marketing clearance for new products and new indications for existing products we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials with a variety of study designs patient populations and trial endpoints Unexpected or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials or other analyses conducted by us by our competitors or by third parties including acquired businesses prior to acquisition by us or the FDAs or the markets perception of this clinical data may adversely impact our ability to obtain product approvals our position in and share of the markets in which we participate and our business financial condition results of operations or future prospects The medical device industry and its customers continue to face scrutiny and regulation by governmental authorities and are often the subject of numerous investigations often involving marketing and other business practices or product quality issues including device recalls or advisories These investigations could result in the commencement of civil and criminal proceedings imposition of substantial fines penalties and administrative remedies including corporate integrity agreements stipulated judgments or exclusion diversion of our employees and managements attention imposition of administrative costs and have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity and may lead to greater governmental regulation in the future The medical devices we design develop manufacture and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and numerous other federal state and foreign governmental authorities These authorities continue to closely scrutinize our industry We have received and in the future may receive subpoenas and other requests for information from Congress and state and federal 27 governmental agencies including among others the US Department of Justice DOJ the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services HHS and the Department of Defense as well as from foreign governments and agencies The requests andor subpoenas we have received relate primarily to financial arrangements with healthcare providers regulatory compliance and sale andor product promotional practices We have cooperated with these subpoenas and other requests for information and expect to continue to do so in the future We cannot predict when a matter will be resolved the outcome of the matter or its impact on us and cooperation may involve significant costs including document production costs An adverse outcome in any matter could include the commencement of an investigation civil and criminal proceedings substantial fines penalties and administrative remedies including exclusion from government reimbursement programs entry into Corporate Integrity Agreements CIAs with governmental agencies and amendments to any existing CIAs In addition resolution of any matter could involve the imposition of additional and costly compliance obligations Cooperation with requests and investigations from external agencies result in employee resource costs and diversion of employee focus If any requests or investigations continue over a long period of time they could divert the attention of management from the daytoday operations of our business and impose significant additional administrative burdens on us These potential consequences as well as any adverse outcome from these requests or investigations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity In addition certain foreign governments state governments including that of Massachusetts where we are headquartered and the US federal government have enacted legislation aimed at increasing transparency of our interactions with healthcare providers As an example compliance with the US Physician Payment Sunshine Act requires us by law to disclose payments and other transfers of value to all US physicians and US teaching hospitals at the US federal level made after August 1 2013 Any failure to comply with these legal and regulatory requirements could impact our business In addition we have and may continue to devote substantial additional time and financial resources to further develop and implement enhanced structure policies systems and processes to comply with enhanced legal and regulatory requirements which may also impact our business We anticipate that governmental authorities will continue to scrutinize our industry closely and that additional regulation may increase compliance and legal cost and exposure to litigation and have additional adverse effects on our operations Changes in tax laws unfavorable resolution of tax contingencies or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations andor liquidity We are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes and tariffs in both the US and various foreign jurisdictions We are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision and we have established contingency reserves for material known tax exposures However the calculation of such tax exposures involves the application of complex tax laws and regulations in many jurisdictions as well as interpretations as to the legality under European Union state aid rules of tax advantages granted in certain jurisdictions Therefore there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these disputes or other tax audits or that issues raised by tax authorities will be resolved at a financial cost that does not exceed our related reserves and the actual outcomes of these disputes and other tax audits could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition Changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation and application in the jurisdictions where we are subject to tax could materially impact our effective tax rate The US enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act TCJA on December 22 2017 and we expect the US Treasury to issue future notices and regulations under the TCJA Certain provisions of the TCJA and the regulations issued thereunder could have a significant impact on our future results of operations as could interpretations made by the Company in the absence of regulatory guidance and judicial interpretations The result of the upcoming US presidential and congressional elections may result in additional US tax law changes that could have a material impact on our future effective tax rate Additionally the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD the European Commission EC and individual taxing jurisdictions where we and our affiliates do business have recently focused on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations The OECD has released its comprehensive plan to create an agreed set of international rules for fighting base erosion and profit shifting In addition the OECD the EC and individual countries are examining changes to how taxing rights should be allocated among countries considering the digital economy As a result the tax laws in the US and other countries in which we and our affiliates do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis and any such changes could materially adversely affect our business Our operations in Puerto Rico and Costa Rica presently benefit from various tax incentives and grants Unless these incentives and grants are extended they will expire between 2023 and 2028 If we are unable to renew extend or obtain new incentive and grants the expiration of the existing incentives and grants could have a material impact on our financial results in future periods Furthermore changes in customs laws and regulations in the US and various foreign jurisdictions could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 28 We may not effectively be able to protect our intellectual property or other sensitive data which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations The medical device market in which we participate is largely technology driven Physician customers have historically moved quickly to new products and new technologies As a result intellectual property rights particularly patents and trade secrets play a significant role in product development and differentiation However intellectual property litigation is inherently complex and unpredictable and appellate courts can overturn lower court decisions Furthermore as our business increasingly relies on technology systems and infrastructure our intellectual property other proprietary technology and other sensitive data are potentially vulnerable to loss damage or misappropriation Finally our ability to protect novel business models is uncertain Competing parties in our industry frequently file multiple suits to leverage patent portfolios across product lines technologies and geographies and to balance risk and exposure between the parties In some cases several competitors are parties in the same proceeding or in a series of related proceedings or litigate multiple features of a single class of devices These forces frequently drive settlement not only of individual cases but also of a series of pending and potentially related and unrelated cases In addition although monetary and injunctive relief is typically sought remedies and restitution are generally not determined until the conclusion of the trial court proceedings and can be modified on appeal Accordingly the outcomes of individual cases are difficult to time predict or quantify and are often dependent upon the outcomes of other cases in other geographies A number of third parties have asserted that our current and former product offerings infringe patents owned or licensed by them We have similarly asserted that products sold by our competitors infringe patents owned or licensed by us Adverse outcomes in one or more of the proceedings against us could limit our ability to sell certain products in certain jurisdictions or reduce our operating margin on the sale of these products and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity Patents and other proprietary rights are and will continue to be essential to our business and our ability to compete effectively with other companies will be dependent upon the proprietary nature of our technologies We rely upon trade secrets knowhow continuing technological innovations strategic alliances and licensing opportunities to develop maintain and strengthen our competitive position We pursue a policy of generally obtaining patent protection in both the US and abroad for patentable subject matter in our proprietary devices and attempt to review thirdparty patents and patent applications to the extent publicly available in order to develop an effective patent strategy avoid infringement of thirdparty patents identify licensing opportunities and monitor the patent claims of others We currently own numerous US and foreign patents and have numerous patent applications pending We also are party to various license agreements pursuant to which patent rights have been obtained or granted in consideration for cash crosslicensing rights or royalty payments No assurance can be made that any pending or future patent applications will result in the issuance of patents that any current or future patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged or circumvented by our competitors or that our patents will not be found invalid In addition we may have to take legal action in the future to protect our patents trade secrets or knowhow or to assert them against claimed infringement by others Any legal action of that type could be costly and time consuming and no assurances can be made that any lawsuit will be successful We are generally involved as both a plaintiff and a defendant in a number of patent infringement and other intellectual propertyrelated actions The invalidation of key patents or proprietary rights that we own or an unsuccessful outcome in lawsuits to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations In addition the laws of certain countries in which we market and plan on manufacturing some of our products in the near future do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the US If we are unable to protect our intellectual property in these countries it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations Furthermore our intellectual property other proprietary technology and other sensitive data are potentially vulnerable to loss damage or misappropriation from system malfunction computer viruses and unauthorized access to our data or misappropriation or misuse thereof by those with permitted access and other events While we have invested to protect our intellectual property products and other data and continue to work diligently in this area there can be no assurance that our precautionary measures will prevent breakdowns breaches cyberattacks or other events Such events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition or results of operations We rely on the proper function availability and security of information technology systems to operate our business and a cyberattack or other breach of these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations We rely on information technology systems including technology from third party vendors to process transmit and store electronic information in our daytoday operations Similar to other large multinational companies the size and complexity of our information technology systems makes them vulnerable to a cyberattack malicious intrusion breakdown destruction loss of 29 data privacy or other significant disruption Our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology evolving systems and regulatory standards the increasing need to protect patient and customer information and changing customer patterns In addition third parties may attempt to hack into our products to obtain data relating to patients or disrupt performance of our products or to access our proprietary information and the technology from third party vendors that we rely upon may have defects or vulnerabilities which in turn create vulnerabilities or disruptions in our system Any failure by us to maintain or protect our information technology systems products and data integrity including from cyberattacks intrusions or other breaches could result in the unauthorized access to patient data and personally identifiable information theft of intellectual property or other misappropriation of assets or otherwise compromise our confidential or proprietary information and disrupt our operations or in the worst case could result in harm to patients Such failure or demonstration of vulnerability to such failure may also result in additional regulatory scrutiny We also grow our company through acquisitions and may face risks associated with defects and vulnerabilities in their systems as we work to integrate the acquisitions into our information technology system In the US federal and state privacy and security laws require certain of our operations to protect the confidentiality of personal information including patient medical records and other health information and to comply with other requirements with respect to personal data In Europe the Data Protection Directive requires us to manage individually identifiable information in the EU and the new General Data Protection Regulation GDPR may impose fines of up to four percent of our global revenue in the event of violations after implementation of the requirements on May 25 2018 Internationally some countries have also passed laws that require individually identifiable data on their citizens to be maintained on local servers and that may restrict transfer or processing of that data We believe that we meet the expectations of applicable regulations and that the ongoing costs and impacts of ensuring compliance with such rules are not material to our business However there is no guarantee that we will avoid enforcement actions by governmental bodies or civil actions based on this growing body of regulations Enforcement actions could be costly and interrupt regular operations of our business Any of these events in turn may cause us to lose existing customers have difficulty preventing detecting and controlling fraud have disputes with customers physicians and other healthcare professionals be subject to legal claims and liability have regulatory sanctions or penalties imposed have increases in operating expenses incur expenses or lose revenues as a result of a data privacy breach or theft of intellectual property or suffer other adverse consequences any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations Pending and future intellectual property litigation could be costly and disruptive to us We operate in an industry that is susceptible to significant intellectual property litigation and in recent years it has been common for companies in the medical device field to aggressively challenge the patent rights of other companies We are currently the subject of various patent litigation proceedings and other proceedings described in more detail under Note J  Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report  Intellectual property litigation is expensive complex and lengthy and its outcome is difficult to predict Adverse outcomes in one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell certain products and on our operating margins financial condition results of operation or liquidity Pending or future patent litigation may result in significant royalty or other payments or injunctions that can prevent the sale of products and may significantly divert the attention of our technical and management personnel In the event that our right to market any of our products is successfully challenged we may be required to obtain a license on terms which may not be favorable to us if at all If we fail to obtain a required license or are unable to design around a patent our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected Pending and future product liability claims and other litigation including private securities litigation stockholder derivative suits and contract litigation may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations or liquidity The design manufacturing and marketing of medical devices of the types that we produce entail an inherent risk of product liability claims Many of the medical devices that we manufacture and sell are designed to be implanted in the human body for long periods of time or indefinitely A number of factors could result in an unsafe condition or injury to or death of a patient with respect to these or other products that we manufacture or sell including physician technique and experience in performing the surgical procedure component failures manufacturing flaws design defects offlabel use or inadequate disclosure of productrelated risks or productrelated information These factors could result in product liability claims a recall of one or more of our products or a safety alert relating to one or more of our products Product liability claims may be brought by individuals or by groups seeking to represent a class 30 We are currently the subject of product liability litigation proceedings and other proceedings described in more detail under Note J  Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report  The outcome of litigation particularly class action lawsuits is difficult to assess or quantify Plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits often seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts including not only actual damages but also punitive damages The magnitude of the potential losses relating to these lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time In addition the cost to defend against any future litigation may be significant Product liability claims securities and commercial litigation and other litigation in the future regardless of the outcome could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity Additionally we maintain an insurance policy providing limited coverage against securities claims and we are substantially selfinsured with respect to product liability claims and fully selfinsured with respect to intellectual property infringement claims The fact that we do not maintain thirdparty insurance coverage for all categories of losses increases our exposure to unanticipated claims and adverse decisions and these losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity Any failure to meet regulatory quality standards applicable to our manufacturing and quality processes could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and
