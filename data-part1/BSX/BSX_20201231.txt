also be subject to potential interruptions Many components used in the manufacturing of our products are readily fabricated from commonly available raw materials or offtheshelf items available from multiple supply sources however certain items are custom made to meet our specifications We believe that in most cases redundant capacity exists at our suppliers and that alternative sources of supply are available or could be developed within a reasonable period of time We have an ongoing supplier resiliency program which identifies and mitigates risk We are also striving to build diversity and inclusion into every aspect of our company including our supply chain We are committed to the increased and sustained support of diverse businesses that share our dedication to improving the quality of patient care Quality Assurance We are committed to providing high quality products to our customers Our quality system starts with the initial product specification and continues through the design of the product component specification process and the manufacturing sale and servicing of the product Our quality system is intended to build in quality and process control and to utilize continuous improvement concepts throughout the product life Our quality system is also designed to enable us to satisfy various international quality system regulations including those of the US Food and Drug Administration FDA with respect to products sold in the US All of our medical device manufacturing facilities and distribution centers are certified under the ISO 13485 quality system standard established by the International Standards Organization ISO for medical devices which includes requirements for an implemented quality system that applies to component quality supplier control product

across our product lines and in each market in which we sell our products and solutions some from companies that may have greater financial sales and marketing resources than we do Our primary competitors include Abbott Laboratories and Medtronic plc as well as a wide range of medical device companies that sell a single or limited number of competitive products or participate in only a specific market segment In certain countries we face competition from domestic medical device companies that may benefit from their status as local suppliers We also face competition from nonmedical device companies which may offer alternative therapies for disease states that could also be treated using our products or from companies offering technologies that could augment or replace procedures using our products We believe that our products and solutions compete primarily on their ability to deliver both clinical and economic outcomes for our customers by enabling physicians to perform diagnostic and therapeutic procedures safely and effectively often in a lessinvasive manner We also compete on ease of use comparative effectiveness reliability and physician familiarity In the current environment of managed care with economicallymotivated buyers consolidation among healthcare providers increasing prevalence and importance of regional and national tenders increased competition and declining reimbursement rates we have 11 been increasingly required to compete on the basis of price value reliability and efficiency We believe the current global economic conditions and healthcare reform measures could continue to put additional competitive pressure on us including on our average selling prices overall procedure rates and addressable market sizes We recognize that our continued competitive success will depend upon our ability to  offer products and solutions that provide differentiated clinical and economic outcomes  create or acquire innovative scientifically advanced technologies  apply our technology and solutions costeffectively and with superior quality across product lines and markets  develop or acquire proprietary products and solutions  attract and retain skilled personnel  obtain patent or other protection for our products  obtain required regulatory and reimbursement approvals  compete in regional and national tenders for our products  continually enhance our quality systems  manufacture and market our products and solutions either directly or through third parties and  supply sufficient inventory to meet customer demand Medical Device Regulatory Approvals The medical devices that we manufacture and market are subject to regulation by numerous worldwide regulatory bodies including the FDA and comparable international regulatory agencies These agencies require manufacturers of medical devices to comply with applicable laws and regulations governing development testing manufacturing labeling marketing and distribution Medical devices are also generally subject to varying levels of regulatory control based on risk level of the device In the US authorization to distribute a new device can generally be met in one of three ways The first process requires that a premarket notification 510k be made to the FDA to demonstrate that the device is as safe and effective as or substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device the predicate device Applicants must submit performance data to establish substantial equivalence In some instances data from human clinical trials must also be submitted in support of a 510k premarket notification If so these data must be collected in a manner that conforms to the applicable Investigational Device Exemption IDE regulations The FDA must issue a decision finding substantial equivalence before commercial distribution can occur Changes to cleared devices that could not significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device can generally be made without additional 510k premarket notifications otherwise a new 510k is required The second process requires the submission of a premarket approval PMA application to the FDA to demonstrate that the device is safe and effective for its intended use This approval process applies to most Class III devices and generally requires clinical data to support the safety and effectiveness of the device obtained in adherence with IDE requirements The FDA will approve the PMA application if it finds that there is a reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended purpose and that the proposed manufacturing is in compliance with the Quality System Regulation QSR For novel technologies the FDA may seek input from an advisory panel of medical experts and seek their views on the safety effectiveness and benefitrisk of the device The PMA process is generally more detailed lengthier and more expensive than the 510k process The third process requires that an application for a Humanitarian Device Exemption HDE be made to the FDA for the use of a Humanitarian Use Device HUD A HUD is intended to benefit patients by treating or diagnosing a disease or condition that affects or is manifested in not more than 8000 individuals in the US per year The application submitted to the FDA for an HDE must demonstrate that the device does not expose the patient to unreasonable risk and that the benefit of device use outweighs the risk The HUD provision of the regulation provides an incentive for the development of devices for use in the treatment or diagnosis of diseases affecting smaller patient populations In the European Union EU we will be required to comply with the Medical Device Regulation MDR or EU MDR effective May 2021 previously May 2020 which will supersede the current Medical Device Directives Medical devices which have a valid CE Certificate to the current Directives issued before May 2021 can continue to be sold until May 2024 or until the CE Certificate expires whichever comes first providing there are no significant changes to the design or intended use The CE Mark which is required to sell medical devices in the EU is affixed following a Conformity Assessment and either approval from the appointed independent Notified Body or through selfcertification by the manufacturer The selected pathway to CE marking is based on device risk classification CE marking indicates conformity to the applicable Essential Requirements ERs of the relevant Medical Devices Directive and in the future to the General Safety and Performance Requirements GSPRs for the MDR The MDR will change multiple aspects of the existing regulatory framework for CE marking such as increased clinical evidence requirements changes to labelling and new requirements including Unique Device Identification UDI and 12 many new postmarket reporting obligations MDR modifies and increases the compliance requirements for the medical device industry and will require significant investment over the next few years to implement We are also required to comply with the regulations of every other country where we commercialize products before we can launch or maintain new products on the market such as the requirements that we obtain approval from the Japanese Ministry of Health Labor and Welfare MHLW through the review at Japanese Pharmaceutical  Medical Device Agency PMDA and the China National Medical Product Administration NMPA Many countries that previously did not have medical device regulations or had minimal regulations are now introducing them For example India is in the process of expanding its current regulations to include all medical device categories while many countries in the Middle East and Southeast Asia are introducing new regulations as well The FDA and other worldwide regulatory agencies and competent authorities actively monitor compliance to local laws and regulations through review and inspection of design and manufacturing practices recordkeeping reporting of adverse events labeling and promotional practices The FDA can ban certain medical devices detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices order recall or market withdrawal of these devices and require notification of health professionals and others with regard to medical devices that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health The FDA may also enjoin and restrain a company for certain violations of the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Safe Medical Devices Act pertaining to medical devices or initiate action for criminal prosecution of such violations Regulatory agencies and authorities in the countries where we do business can halt production in or distribution within their respective country or otherwise take action in accordance with local laws and regulations International sales of medical devices manufactured in the US that are not approved by the FDA for use in the US or that are banned or deviate from lawful performance standards are subject to FDA export requirements Additionally exported devices are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country to which the device is exported Some countries do not have medical device regulations but in most foreign countries medical devices are regulated Frequently regulatory approval may first be obtained in a foreign country prior to application in the US due to differing regulatory requirements however other countries such as China for example require approval in the country of origin first Most countries outside of the US require that product approvals be recertified on a regular basis The recertification process requires that we evaluate any device changes and any new regulations or standards relevant to the device and where needed conduct appropriate testing to document continued compliance Where recertification applications are required they must be approved in order to continue selling our products in those countries Government Affairs We maintain a global Government Affairs presence headquartered in Washington DC to actively monitor and advocate on myriad legislation and policies that may potentially impact the Company both on a domestic and an international front The Government Affairs office works closely with members of Congress and committee staff the White House and Administration offices state Governors legislatures and regulatory agencies embassies and global governments on issues affecting our business Our proactive approach and depth of political and policy expertise are aimed at having our positions heard by federal state and global decisionmakers to improve patient care and to advance our business objectives by educating policymakers on our positions key priorities and the value of our technologies The Government Affairs office manages our political action committee and works closely with trade groups on issues affecting our industry and healthcare in general The Government Affairs office also advocates for public policy that benefits our employees and the patients we serve and supports the communities in which we live Healthcare Policies and Reimbursement Political economic and regulatory influences around the world continue to subject the healthcare industry to potential fundamental changes that could substantially affect our results of operations Government and private sector initiatives related to limiting the growth of healthcare costs including price regulation coverage and payment policies comparative effectiveness reviews of therapies technology assessments and healthcare delivery structure reforms are continuing in many countries where we do business We believe that these changes are causing the marketplace to put increased emphasis on the delivery of treatments that can reduce costs improve efficiencies andor increase patient access Although we believe our lessinvasive products and technologies generate favorable clinical outcomes value and cost efficiency the resources necessary to demonstrate value to our customers patients payers and other stakeholders are significant and new therapies may now take longer periods of time to gain widespread adoption The US Federal government and certain state governments have enacted laws aimed at increasing transparency or sunshine in relationships between medical device biologics and pharmaceutical companies and healthcare professionals HCPs As a 13 result we are required by law to report many types of payments and transfers of value provided to HCPs Certain foreign jurisdictions have similar laws or are currently acting to implement similar laws Failure to comply with sunshine laws andor implement and adhere to adequate policies and practices to address changes to legal and regulatory requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations Additional legislation at the state and federal levels may result in further changes to these laws We expect that pricing of medical devices will remain under pressure as price transparency expansion of site neutrality or consistent reimbursement regardless of treatment location alternative payment reform valuebased purchasing and accountable care organizations ACOs continue to take shape in the US and abroad We also expect marketplace changes to place pressure on medical device pricing as hospitals consolidate and large group purchasing organizations hospital networks and other groups continue to seek to aggregate purchasing power Similarly governments are increasing the use of tenders placing pressure on medical device pricing Some governments also seek to limit the growth of healthcare costs through price regulation Implementation of cost containment initiatives and healthcare reforms in significant markets such as the US China Australia and other markets may limit the price of or the level at which reimbursement is provided for our products which in turn may influence a hospitals or physicians selection of products used to treat patients Our products are purchased principally by hospitals physicians and other healthcare providers around the world that typically bill various thirdparty payers including government programs eg Medicare and Medicaid in the US and private insurance payers for the services provided to their patients Thirdparty payers and governments may approve or deny coverage for certain technologies and associated procedures based on independently determined assessment criteria Coverage decisions by payers for these technologies and associated procedures are based on a wide range of methodologies that may reflect the assessed resource costs clinical outcomes and economic value of the technologies and associated procedures The new US Administration may attempt to reverse some of the previous Administrations changes to the Affordable Care Act ACA particularly related to healthcare coverage for the uninsured and is further expected to introduce more ambitious healthcare legislation which could include what is commonly referred to as a public option or changes to Medicare age requirements If passed this legislation would lead to increased coverage levels and utilization of services however at this point the impact of any such changes is unclear because specific changes have not been enacted or implemented Proprietary Rights and Patent Litigation We rely on a combination of patents trademarks trade secrets and other forms of intellectual property to protect our proprietary rights We generally file patent applications in the US and foreign countries where patent protection for our technology is appropriate and available As of December 31 2020 we held more than 18000 patents and had approximately 6000 patent applications pending worldwide that cover various aspects of our technology In addition we hold exclusive and nonexclusive licenses to a variety of thirdparty technologies covered by patents and patent applications In the aggregate these intellectual property assets and licenses are of material importance to our business however we believe that no single patent technology trademark intellectual property asset or license is material in relation to our business as a whole We rely on nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements with employees consultants and other parties to protect in part trade secrets and other proprietary technology There has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry particularly in the areas in which we compete We continue to defend ourselves against claims and legal actions alleging infringement of the patent rights of others Additionally we may find it necessary to initiate litigation to enforce our patent rights to protect our trade secrets or knowhow and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others Accordingly we may seek to settle some or all of our pending litigation particularly to manage risk over time Settlement may include cross licensing of the patents that are the subject of the litigation as well as our other intellectual property and may involve monetary payments to or from third parties We maintain insurance policies providing limited coverage against securities claims We are substantially selfinsured with respect to product liability claims and fully selfinsured with respect to intellectual property infringement claims The absence of significant thirdparty insurance coverage increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims or adverse decisions See Note K  Commitments and Contingencies to our 2020 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report for a discussion of intellectual property product liability and other litigation and proceedings in which we are involved 14 Human

an independent third party to assess pay equity across all positions Our most recent analysis showed that our global workforce had a less than one percent statistical difference in pay along gender lines Similarly a less than one percent statistical difference in pay was noted for multicultural talent in the US and Puerto Rico 15 Employee Health and Safety We take a global approach to prioritizing and monitoring employee safety and we strive to foster a safetyoriented culture in all of our offices and facilities We set health and safety goals which measure the number of injuries per 100 employees for every manufacturing and distribution site Our Employee Health  Safety Operations Council reviews performance monthly to discuss trends and risks as well as opportunities for improvement We have established a companywide safety goal of 025 or fewer injuries per 100 employees by 2030 cutting our 2019 incident rate by 50 percent Employee Growth and Development Developing our people professionally is one of the most important things we do We have a robust succession planning program to ensure our future leaders are ready to assume roles as they become available At every

technical courses including onthejob training skillsbased learning mentoring opportunities and leadership development programs for highpotential employees Employee Engagement We seek ongoing feedback from our employees to better understand what we are doing well and conversely how we can improve their experience In addition to encouraging ongoing communication and feedback between employees and their managers we conduct periodic employee engagement surveys to ensure all employees have an opportunity to share their insights and we take appropriate action in response Corporate Social Responsibility Within many of the communities in which we operate we have launched and funded a multiyear program to combat racism inequity and injustice focused on five pillars community economic empowerment education healthcare disparities and governmentlegislative change We also continue our longterm Close the Gap initiative which focuses on raising awareness and empowering healthcare providers to reach more patients of color fight longstanding inequities and address barriers to care Through Close the Gap hospitals and health systems are provided with zip code level data that highlight the disparities in treatment between white and nonwhite patients in their communities The information allows health care administrators and providers to focus on improving care to underserved populations within their communities As evidence of our progress we were named among the Top 50 of Americas Most Just Companies by ForbesJust Capital ranking 38 overall and also tied 1 for diversity equity and inclusion We were also named to the 2020 Dow Jones Sustainability Index North America one of the most prestigious global benchmarks for corporate responsibility as well as

local communities Through a number of global activities employees helped pack over 34000 kits from their homes that provided STEM activities health and wellness supplies snacks and other essentials to populations in need We are proud of these efforts and the collective impact we have on advancing possibilities across the globe In 2020 our employees volunteered to make a positive impact in community activities in more than 50 countries We also support the US communities where we have significant business presences through the Boston Scientific Foundation The mission of the Foundation is simple to help expand access to quality healthcare and educational opportunities for underserved populations The Boston Scientific Foundation awarded scholarships to children of employees and grant awards across the US in 2020 The process involved more than 65 employee volunteers who evaluated proposals for the Boston Scientific Foundation Board review and approval upon which the Boston Scientific Foundation was able to help fuel grassroots innovative solutions to improve access to quality healthcare and create new opportunities for students to learn and achieve In 2020 we found new and creative ways to help our communities navigate the challenges of the COVID19 pandemic We contributed more than 18 million to aid relief efforts globally through monetary and supply donations and by providing engineering and manufacturing expertise and resources This included donations of personal protective equipment PPE and medical equipment to local hospitals and government agencies Through collaboration with the University of Minnesota Bakken Medical Device Center and industry peers we brought an emergency resuscitator to market which can be used as an alternative when traditional ventilators are not available We also provided support to children families and the most vulnerable through direct financial contributions to local community and global nonprofit organizations including Project HOPE and International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies 17 Seasonality Our net sales are influenced by many factors including product launches acquisitions regulatory and reimbursement approvals patient physician and employee holiday schedules and other macroeconomic conditions While our consolidated net sales do not reflect any significant degree of

carefully in evaluating our business Our business financial condition cash flows or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks This section contains forwardlooking statements You should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forwardlooking statements set forth at the end of Item 1 Business of this Annual Report Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business financial condition cash flows or results of operations COVID19 Risks The ongoing global COVID19 pandemic and related impacts are having a material adverse effect on our operations financial performance and cash flows We are unable to predict the extent to which the pandemic and related impacts will continue to adversely impact our business operations financial performance results of operations financial position and the achievement of our strategic objectives Our operations financial performance and cash flows have been negatively impacted by the ongoing COVID19 pandemic that has caused and is expected to continue to cause the global slowdown of economic activity including the decrease in demand for a broad variety of goods and services disruptions in global supply chains and significant volatility disruption of financial markets a US economic recession and potentially a global economic recession Because the severity magnitude and duration of the COVID19 pandemic and its economic consequences are uncertain rapidly changing and difficult to predict the pandemics impact on our operations and financial performance as well as its impact on our ability to execute our business strategies and initiatives successfully remains uncertain and difficult to predict Further the ultimate impact of the COVID19 pandemic on our operations and financial performance depends on many factors that are not within our control including but not limited to governmental business and individuals actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic including restrictions on travel transport and workforce pressures and voluntary or mandated deferrals or postponements of elective procedures the impact of the pandemic and actions taken in response on global and regional economies travel and economic activity the availability of federal state local or nonUS funding programs general economic uncertainty in key global markets and financial market volatility global economic conditions and levels of economic growth and the timing and pace of recovery when the COVID19 pandemic subsides which could be impacted by a number of factors including limited provider capacity to perform procedures using our products that were deferred as a result of the pandemic The COVID19 pandemic has subjected and may continue to subject our operations financial performance and financial condition to a number of risks including but not limited to those discussed below  Operationsrelated risks  Across all of our businesses we have faced increased operational challenges from the need to protect employee health and safety Some of these challenges include site shutdowns workplace disruptions and restrictions on the movement of people raw materials and goods both at our own facilities and at customers and suppliers We also experienced and may continue experiencing lower demand and volume for certain products and services customer requests for potential payment deferrals or other contract modifications delays of deliveries and other factors related directly and indirectly to the COVID19 pandemic that adversely impact our businesses We expect that the longer the period of economic and global supply chain disruption continues the more material the cumulative adverse impact will be on our business operations financial performance and results of operations Our ability to manufacture our products is highly dependent on our ability to maintain the safety and health of our employees The ability of our employees to work may be significantly impacted by one or more employees contracting or being exposed to COVID19 Additionally when the economic recovery following the COVID19 pandemic occurs we may experience unpredictable increases in demand for certain of our products which could exceed our capacity to meet such demand on a timely basis or at all which could have a material adverse impact on our business operations financial performance and results of operations Further the prioritization of vaccine distribution could affect the availability of transportation for our supply chain needs  Customerrelated risks  In particular as a result of impacts associated with preventive and precautionary measures that we other businesses and governments have taken to quell the spread of COVID19 and protect our customers employees and the patients receiving our products we have experienced significant and unpredictable reductions in demand for certain of our products as health care customers reprioritize the treatment of patients In certain jurisdictions in the United States governmental authorities have recommended and in certain cases required that elective procedures be suspended or canceled to avoid nonessential patient exposure to medical environments and potential infection with COVID19 and to focus limited resources and personnel capacity toward the treatment of COVID19 These measures and challenges significantly reduced our net sales and the situation remains challenging 23 In certain jurisdictions however the timing of the pandemic and public health measures have resulted in lower levels of COVID19 cases and some hospitals have developed protocols such that elective procedures may be conducted safely and are approaching preCOVID19 pandemic levels Further once the pandemic subsides we anticipate there may be some continued reluctance upon the part of some patients to seek medical attention in a hospital setting In addition for the majority of patients who do seek appointments with physicians and surgeries to be performed at hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers relating to a variety of medical conditions we anticipate there may be a substantial backlog As a result patients seeking to schedule or reschedule elective or deferrable procedures utilizing our products may have to navigate potentially limited healthcare provider capacity We believe this likely patient reluctance and potential healthcare provider capacity could have an adverse effect on our sales following the end of the pandemic  Employeerelated risks  In an attempt to proactively address the changed business environment caused by COVID19 in order to preserve employees jobs and ensure we are able to quickly respond to increased customer demand when deferrable procedures resume as permitted by development or conclusion of the pandemic we made temporary work hour reductions and corresponding salary reductions where appropriate for many of our employees However because the severity magnitude and duration of the COVID19 pandemic and its economic consequences are uncertain rapidly changing and difficult to predict we may in the future have to consider taking additional actions including further reductions to salary and work hours furloughs restructuring layoffs or extensions of remote work arrangements which may negatively impact our workforce and our business These negative impacts could include inhibiting our ability to quickly respond to increased customer demand and to take advantage of more favorable economic and market conditions after the pandemic subsides as well as lower productivity and higher employee attrition  Accountingrelated risks Generally accepted accounting principles and the related authoritative guidance are complex and involve subjective judgments In particular the accounting for revenue inventory goodwill intangible assets income taxes and other assets and liabilities requires reliance on forward looking estimates of sales andor earnings Due to the uncertainty surrounding the COVID19 pandemic estimating the future performance of our business is extremely challenging and the range of deviation from internal estimates could be more significant in this environment Changes in the underlying estimates assumptions or judgments could have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations financial position and cash flows  Leverage and marketrelated risks  The current financial market dynamics and volatility pose heightened risks to our previously announced timelines for decreasing our leverage which we expect to be delayed as we seek to maintain appropriate liquidity to compensate for lower cash flows from operations or as variables impacting our leverage ratios fluctuate with extreme market volatility  Liquidity and fundingrelated risks  While we have significant sources of cash and liquidity and access to committed credit lines a prolonged period of generating lower cash from operations could adversely affect our financial condition and the achievement of our strategic objectives Additionally there can also be no assurance that we will not face credit rating downgrades as a result of weaker than anticipated performance of our businesses slower progress in decreasing our leverage or other factors Future downgrades could further adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins liquidity competitive position and access to capital markets and a significant downgrade could have an adverse commercial impact on our business Conditions in the financial and credit markets may also limit the availability of funding or increase the cost of funding including for receivables monetization or supply chain finance programs as well as increased borrowing costs and higher interest rates which could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations Although the US federal and other governments have instituted andor announced a number of funding programs to support businesses our ability or willingness to access funding under such programs may be limited by regulations or other guidance or by further change or uncertainty related to the terms of these programs As the COVID19 pandemic continues to adversely affect our operating and financial results it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in the risk factors in this Annual Report on Form 10K Further the COVID19 pandemic may also affect our operating and financial results in a manner that is not presently known to us or that we currently do not expect to present significant risks to our operations or financial results particularly if the COVID19 pandemic and its associated impacts reoccur in successive waves in the coming months 24 Market Risks We face intense competition and may not be able to keep pace with the rapid technological changes in the medical devices industry which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations The medical device markets in which we participate are highly competitive We encounter significant competition across our product lines and in each market in which our products are sold from various medical device companies Some of our competitors may have greater financial and marketing resources than we do including as a result of consolidation among companies in our industry Our primary competitors include Abbott Laboratories and Medtronic plc as well as a wide range of medical device companies that sell a single or limited number of competitive products or which participate in only a specific market segment or segments We also face competition from nonmedical device companies including pharmaceutical companies which may offer alternative therapies for disease states also amenable to treatment using our products New competitors may emerge in the future potentially including companies introducing new sales or distribution models to our industry or leveraging robotic navigation andor other automation technologies Digital technologies have and may continue to increase in their applicability and importance to various aspects of our business operating and competitive environments RD pipeline and product portfolio We believe we will need to develop new and enhanced digital capabilities and competences in order to remain competitive In addition the medical device markets in which we participate are characterized by extensive research and development and rapid technological change Developments by other companies of products andor services processes or technologies may make our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive and may negatively impact our net sales It is necessary for us to devote continued efforts and financial resources to the development or acquisition of scientifically advanced technologies and products In addition we will need to apply our technologies costeffectively across product lines and markets obtain patent and other protection for our technologies and products obtain required regulatory and reimbursement approvals and successfully manufacture and market our products consistent with our quality standards If we fail to develop or acquire new products or enhance existing products such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations In addition a delay in the timing of the launch of nextgeneration products and the overall performance of and continued physician confidence in those products may result in declines in our market share and have an adverse impact on our business financial condition or results of operations We may experience declines in market size average selling prices for our products medical procedure volumes and our share of the markets in which we compete which may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition We continue to experience pressures across many of our businesses due to competitive activity increased market power of our customers as the healthcare industry consolidates national and regional government tenders economic pressures experienced by our customers public perception of our products and the impact of managed care organizations and other thirdparty payers These and other factors may adversely impact market sizes as well as our share of the markets in which we compete the average selling prices for our products or medical procedure volumes There can be no assurance that the size of the markets in which we compete will increase above existing levels that we will be able to regain or gain market share or compete effectively on the basis of price or that the number of procedures in which our products are used will increase above existing levels Decreases in market sizes or our market share and declines in average selling prices or procedural volumes could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition Continued consolidation in the healthcare industry or additional governmental controls exerted over pricing in key markets could lead to increased demands for price concessions or limit or eliminate our ability to sell to certain of our significant market segments which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations Numerous initiatives and reforms by legislators regulators and thirdparty payers to curb the rising cost of healthcare and to increase access to care have catalyzed a consolidation of aggregate purchasing power within the markets in which we sell our products Additionally a growing number of countries have instituted or are contemplating introducing regional or national tender processes driven primarily by price In some cases such processes may favor local companies to multinational companies like Boston Scientific As the healthcare industry consolidates competition to provide products and services is expected to continue to intensify resulting in pricing pressures decreased average selling prices and the exclusion of certain suppliers from important market segments We expect that market demand government regulation thirdparty coverage and reimbursement policies government contracting requirements and societal pressures will continue to change the worldwide healthcare industry resulting in further business consolidations and alliances among our customers which may increase competition exert further downward pressure on the prices of our products and services and may adversely impact our business financial condition or results of operations 25 Healthcare cost containment pressures government payment and delivery system reforms changes in private payer policies and marketplace consolidations could decrease the demand for our products the prices which customers are willing to pay for those products andor the number of procedures performed using our devices which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations Our products are purchased principally by hospitals physicians and other healthcare providers around the world that typically bill various thirdparty payers including government programs authorities or agencies eg Medicare and Medicaid in the US and private health plans for the healthcare services provided to their patients Governments and payers may also institute changes in healthcare delivery systems that may reduce funding for services or encourage greater scrutiny of healthcare costs The ability of customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for their products and services is critical to the success of medical technology companies because it affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay Reimbursement and funding vary by country and can significantly impact the acceptance of new products and technologies and the use of established products and technologies We may find limited demand for promising new products unless reimbursement approval is obtained from private and governmental thirdparty payers Further legislative or administrative reforms to the reimbursement systems in the US Japan or other countries in a manner that significantly reduce or eliminate reimbursement for procedures using our medical devices including price regulation site of service requirements competitive bidding and tendering coverage and payment policies comparative effectiveness of therapies heightened clinical data requirements technology assessments and managedcare arrangements could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations Geopolitical Risks We are subject to a number of market business financial legal and regulatory risks and uncertainties with respect to our international operations that could have a material impact on our business financial condition or results of operations International net sales accounted for 42 percent of our global net sales in 2020 An important part of our strategy is to continue pursuing growth opportunities in net sales and market share outside of the US by expanding global presence including in Emerging Markets Our international operations are subject to a number of market business and financial risks and uncertainties including those related to our use of channel partners geopolitical and economic instability foreign currency exchange and interest rate fluctuations competitive product offerings local changes in healthcare financing and payment systems and healthcare delivery systems local product preferences and requirements including preferences for local manufacturers workforce instability weaker intellectual property protection in certain countries than exists in the US and longer accounts receivable cycles Such risks and uncertainties may adversely impact our ability to implement our growth strategy in these markets and as a result our sales growth market share and operating profits from our international operations may be adversely affected Our international operations are subject to established and developing legal and regulatory requirements for medical devices in each country in which our products are marketed and sold Most foreign countries have medical device regulations Further most countries outside of the US require product approvals be renewed or recertified on a regular basis in order to continue to be marketed and sold there In addition several countries that previously did not have regulatory requirements for medical devices have established such requirements in recent years and other countries have expanded or plan to expand existing regulations including requiring local clinical data in addition to global clinical data These factors have caused or may cause us to experience more uncertainty risk expense and delay in obtaining approvals and commercializing products in certain jurisdictions which could adversely impact our net sales market share and operating profits from our international operations Further international markets are affected by economic pressure to contain healthcare costs which can lead to more rigorous evidence requirements and lower reimbursement rates for either our products directly or procedures in which our products are used Governments and payers may also institute changes in healthcare delivery systems that may reduce funding for services or encourage greater scrutiny of healthcare costs In addition certain international markets may also be affected by foreign government efforts to reference reimbursement rates in other countries All of these types of changes may ultimately reduce selling prices of our products andor reduce the number of procedures in which our products are used which may adversely impact our net sales market share and operating profits from our international operations In addition our international operations are subject to other established and developing US and foreign legal and regulatory requirements including FCPA andor similar laws in other countries and US and foreign import and export controls and licensing requirements trade protection and embargo measures and customs laws Global businesses including those in the medical device industry are facing increasing scrutiny of and heightened enforcement efforts with respect to their international operations Any alleged or actual failure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements may subject us to government scrutiny civil andor criminal proceedings sanctions and other liabilities which may have a material adverse effect on our international operations financial condition results of operations andor liquidity 26 On January 31 2020 the United Kingdom UK formally exited the European Union EU and a transition period began during which time the UK and the EU negotiated a trade agreement and other terms associated with their future relationship The transition period ended on December 31 2020 The short and longterm impact of the UKs exit from the EU on European and global macroeconomic conditions our business operations and results of operations remain unknown Changes in industry regulations could have an effect on existing CE certificates being renewed and new certificates being issued which would impact the ability to trade however it is impossible to assess the full impact at this stage We have implemented a Brexit Response Team and have put in place mitigation procedures intended to reduce any significant operational risks that have been identified to date Any significant changes in the political economic financial competitive legal and regulatory or reimbursement conditions where we conduct or plan to expand our international operations may have a material impact on our business financial condition or results of operations Credit and Financial Risks If we are unable to manage our debt levels maintain investment grade credit ratings at the three ratings agencies or experience a disruption in our cash flows it could have an adverse effect on our cost of borrowing financial condition or results of operations As part of our strategy to maximize stockholder value we use financial leverage to manage our cost of capital Our outstanding debt balance was 9143 billion as of December 31 2020 and 10008 billion as of December 31 2019 Although we currently have investment grade ratings at Moodys Investor Service Standard  Poors Rating Service and Fitch Ratings our inability to maintain investment grade credit ratings could increase our cost of borrowing funds in the future and reduce our access to liquidity Delays in our product development and new product launches could result in disruption in our cash flow or our ability to continue to effectively manage our debt levels could have an adverse effect on our cost of borrowing financial condition or results of operations In addition our credit agreements contain a financial covenant that require us to maintain a minimum specified leverage ratio and place other limits on our business If we are unable to satisfy this covenant we may be required to obtain waivers from our lenders and no assurance can be made that our lenders would grant such waivers on favorable terms or at all and we could be required to repay any borrowings on demand We may record future intangible asset impairment charges related to one or more of our global reporting units which could materially adversely impact our results of operations We test our goodwill balances in the second quarter of each year as of April 1 for impairment or more frequently if impairment indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest an impairment may exist We assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and in evaluating the potential for impairment of goodwill we make assumptions regarding estimated revenue projections growth rates cash flows and discount rates On a quarterly basis we monitor the key drivers of fair value to detect events or other changes that would warrant an interim impairment test of our goodwill and other intangible assets Relatively small declines in the future performance and cash flows of a reporting unit or asset group changes in our reporting units or in the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations acquisitions or divestitures of assets or businesses or small changes in other key assumptions may result in the recognition of significant asset impairment charges which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations Current domestic and international economic conditions could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations Uncertainty about global economic conditions including those resulting from credit and sovereign debt issues has caused and may continue to cause disruption in the financial markets including diminished liquidity and credit availability These conditions may adversely affect our suppliers leading them to experience financial difficulties or be unable to borrow money to fund their operations which could cause disruptions in our ability to produce our products Our customers may experience financial difficulties or be unable to borrow money to fund their operations which may adversely impact their ability or decision to purchase our products particularly capital equipment or to pay for our products that they purchase on a timely basis if at all In addition we have accounts receivable factoring programs in certain European and Asian countries Deterioration of the global economy or increase in sovereign debt issues may impact our ability to transfer receivables to third parties in certain of those countries Third parties such as banks offering factoring programs in these countries are looking to reduce their exposure levels to government owned or supported debt This could result in terminations of or changes to the costs or credit limits of our existing factoring programs Such terminations or changes could have a negative impact on our cash flow and days sales outstanding 27 The strength and timing of economic recovery remains uncertain and there can be no assurance that there will not be further deterioration in the global economy Accordingly we cannot predict to what extent global economic conditions including sovereign debt issues and increased focus on healthcare systems and costs in the US and abroad may continue to impact negatively our average selling prices net sales and profit margins procedural volumes and reimbursement rates from third party payers In addition conditions in the financial markets and other factors beyond our control may adversely affect our ability to borrow money in the credit markets access the capital markets and to obtain financing for acquisitions or other general corporate and commercial purposes Business and Operational Risks Failure to integrate acquired businesses into our operations successfully could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results As part of our strategy to realign our business portfolio we have completed multiple acquisitions in recent years and may pursue additional acquisitions in the future Our integration of acquired businesses requires significant efforts including corporate restructuring and the coordination of information technologies research and development sales and marketing operations regulatory supply chain manufacturing quality systems and finance These efforts result in additional expenses and involve significant management time Some of the factors that could affect the success of our acquisitions include among others the effectiveness of our due diligence process our ability to execute our business plan for the acquired companies the strength of the acquired technology results of clinical trials regulatory approvals and reimbursement levels of the acquired products and related procedures the continued performance of critical transition services our ability to adequately fund acquired inprocess research and development projects and retain key employees and our ability to achieve synergies with our acquired companies such as increasing sales of our products achieving cost savings and effectively combining technologies to develop new products In addition foreign acquisitions involve unique risks including those related to integration of operations across different geographies cultures and languages currency risks and risks associated with the economic political legal and regulatory environment in specific countries Our failure to manage successfully and coordinate the growth of the acquired companies could have an adverse impact on our business and our future growth In addition we cannot be certain that the businesses we acquire will become profitable or remain so and if our acquisitions are not successful we may record related asset impairment charges in the future or experience other negative consequences on our results We may not be successful in our strategy relating to future strategic acquisitions of investments in or alliances with other companies and businesses which have been a significant source of historical growth for us and will be key to our diversification into new markets and technologies Our strategic acquisitions investments and alliances are intended to further expand our ability to offer customers effective high quality medical devices that satisfy their interventional needs These acquisitions investments and alliances have been a significant source of our growth We face competition for acquisitions from other healthcare and nonhealthcare acquirers financial sponsors and from the market for Initial Public Offerings IPOs Strength in the market for IPOs may reduce the set of opportunities available to us for MA andor cause us to need to pay higher prices If we are unsuccessful in our acquisitions investments and alliances we may be unable to grow our business The success of our strategy relating to future acquisitions investments or alliances will depend on a number of factors including our ability to  identify suitable opportunities for acquisition investment or alliance if at all  manage acquisition investment or alliance opportunities within our capital capacity and prioritize those investments to execute on our strategy  manage our due diligence process to uncover potential issues with targets  finance any future acquisition investment or alliance on terms acceptable to us if at all  complete acquisitions investments or alliances in a timely manner on terms that are satisfactory to us if at all  successfully integrate and operate acquired businesses  successfully identify and retain key target employees  comply with applicable laws and regulations including foreign laws and regulations and  protect intellectual property and to prevail in litigation related to newly acquired technologies Any potential future acquisitions we consummate may be dilutive to our earnings and may require additional debt or equity financing depending on their size or nature 28 We may not realize the expected benefits from our restructuring and optimization initiatives our longterm expense reduction programs may result in an increase in shortterm expenses and our efforts may lead to unintended consequences We monitor the dynamics of the economy the healthcare industry and the markets in which we compete and assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency and to better align expenses with revenues while preserving our ability to make investments in research and development projects capital and our people that we believe are important to our longterm success As a result of these assessments we have undertaken restructuring and optimization initiatives in order to enhance our growth potential and position us for longterm success In November 2018 we announced a restructuring initiative the 2019 Restructuring Plan intended to support our effort to improve operating performance and meet anticipated market demands by ensuring that we are appropriately structured and resourced to deliver sustainable value to patients and customers Key activities under the 2019 Restructuring Plan include supply chain network optimization intended to maximize our global manufacturing and distribution network capacity and building functional capabilities that support business growth These activities were initiated in 2019 with the majority of activity expected to be complete by the end of 2022 following a oneyear extension approved by our Board of Directors on February 22 2021 The 2019 Restructuring Plan is expected to result in total pretax charges of approximately 375 million to 475 million and reduce gross annual pretax operating expenses by approximately 200 million to 250 million by the end of 2023 as program benefits are realized We expect a substantial portion of the savings to be reinvested in strategic growth initiatives These measures could yield unintended consequences such as distraction of our management and employees business disruption inability to attract or retain key personnel and reduced employee productivity which could negatively affect our business sales financial condition and results of operations Moreover our restructuring and optimization initiatives result in charges and expenses some of which impact our operating results We cannot guarantee that the activities under our restructuring plans or other optimization initiatives will result in the desired efficiencies and estimated cost savings Our future growth is dependent upon the development of new products and enhancement of existing products which requires significant research and development clinical trials and regulatory approvals all of which may be very expensive and timeconsuming and may not result in commercially viable products In order to develop new products and enhance existing products we focus our research and development programs largely on the development of nextgeneration and novel technology offerings across multiple programs and businesses The development of new products and enhancement of existing products requires significant investment in research and development clinical trials and regulatory approvals The results of our product development efforts may be affected by a number of factors including our ability to anticipate customer needs innovate and develop new products complete clinical trials obtain regulatory approvals and reimbursement in the United States and abroad manufacture products in a costeffective manner obtain appropriate intellectual property protection for our products and gain and maintain market approval of our products There can be no assurance that any products now in development or that we may seek to develop in the future will achieve technological feasibility obtain regulatory approval or gain market acceptance If we are unable to develop and launch new products and enhanced products our ability to maintain or expand our market position in the markets in which we participate may be materially adversely impacted Further we are continuing to investigate and have completed several acquisitions that involve opportunities to further expand our presence in and diversify into priority growth areas by accessing new products and technologies There can be no assurance that our investments will be successful or that we will be able to access new products and technologies on terms favorable to us or that these products and technologies will achieve commercial feasibility obtain regulatory approval or gain market acceptance A delay in the development or approval of new products and technologies or our decision to reduce our investments may adversely impact the contribution of these technologies to our future growth Additionally certain products or groups of products in particular new products or enhancements of existing products may have a disproportionate impact on our business financial condition and results of operations Failure to meet growth projections poor clinical outcomes increasing regulatory requirements launch delays and inability to effectively scale manufacturing and achieve targeted margins with respect to any of these products or groups of products in particular may materially adversely impact on our business financial condition and results of operations Interruption of our supply chain or manufacturing operations including resulting from natural disasters further public heath crises and other catastrophic events or other events outside of our control could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition Our products are designed and manufactured in technology centers around the world either by us or third parties In most cases the manufacturing of any specific product is concentrated in one or a few locations Factors such as a failure to follow specific internal protocols and procedures equipment malfunction environmental factors or damage to one or more of our facilities could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products In the event of an interruption in manufacturing we may be unable to quickly move to alternate means of producing affected products or to meet customer demand In the event of a significant interruption for example as a result of a failure to follow regulatory protocols and procedures we may experience 29 lengthy delays in resuming production of affected products due primarily to needs for regulatory approvals As a result we may experience loss of market share which we may be unable to recapture and harm to our reputation which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition Disruptions in the supply of the materials and components used in manufacturing our products or the sterilization of our products by thirdparty vendors could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition We purchase the majority of the materials and components used in manufacturing our products from thirdparty vendors Certain of these materials and components are purchased from single sources due to quality considerations expertise costs or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements In certain cases we may not be able to establish additional or replacement vendors for such materials or components in a timely or cost effective manner largely as a result of FDA regulations that require validation of materials and components prior to their use in our products and the complex nature of our and many of our vendors manufacturing processes A reduction or interruption in the supply of materials and components used in manufacturing our products an inability to timely develop and validate alternative sources if required or a significant increase in the price of such materials or components could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition In addition many of our products require sterilization prior to sale and we utilize a mix of internal resources and contract sterilizers to perform this service To the extent we or our contract sterilizers are unable to sterilize our products whether due to capacity availability of materials for sterilization regulatory or other constraints including federal and state regulations on the use of ethylene oxide we may be unable to transition to other internal resources contract sterilizers sterilizer locations or sterilization methods in a timely or cost effective manner or at all which could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition Legal and Regulatory Risk Factors Healthcare policy changes including healthcare reform legislation may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows Political economic and policy influences are leading the healthcare industry to make substantial structural and financial changes that will continue affecting our results of operations Government and private sector initiatives limiting the growth of healthcare costs including price regulation coverage and payment policies comparative effectiveness of therapies technology assessments and healthcare delivery structure reforms are continuing in many countries where we do business We believe that these changes are causing the marketplace to put increased emphasis on the delivery of more treatments that can reduce costs improve efficiencies andor increase patient access Although we believe our lessinvasive products and technologies generate favorable clinical outcomes value and cost efficiency the resources and evidence necessary to demonstrate value to our customers patients payers and other stakeholders may be significant and it may take a longer period of time to gain widespread adoption Moreover there can be no assurance that our strategies will succeed for every product The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ACA and Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 were enacted into law in the US in March 2010 Certain provisions of this law including comparative effectiveness research pilot programs to evaluate alternative payment methodologies and other changes to the payment systems have started changing the way healthcare is delivered reimbursed and funded While the extent to which it has affected our business is not clear these changes over the longterm may adversely affect our business and results of operations The new US Administration may attempt to reverse some of the previous Administrations changes to the ACA particularly related to healthcare coverage for the uninsured and is further expected to introduce more ambitious healthcare legislation which could include what is commonly referred to as a public option or changes to Medicare age requirements If passed this legislation would lead to increased coverage levels and utilization of services however at this point the impact of any such changes is unclear because specific changes have not been enacted or implemented We cannot predict the specific healthcare programs and regulations that will be ultimately implemented by regional and national governments globally However any changes that lower reimbursements for either our products andor procedures using our products reduce medical procedure volumes andor increase cost containment pressures on us or others in the healthcare sector could adversely affect our business and results of operations 30 We are subject to extensive and dynamic medical device regulation which may impede or hinder the approval or sale of our products and in some cases may ultimately result in an inability to obtain approval of certain products or may result in the recall or seizure of previously approved products Our products marketing sales and development activities and manufacturing processes are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the FDA pursuant to the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act FDC Act by comparable agencies in foreign countries and by other regulatory agencies and governing bodies Under the FDC Act medical devices must receive FDA clearance or approval or an exemption from such clearance or approval before they can be commercially marketed in the US In the EU we will be required to comply with the new Medical Device Regulation MDR or EU MDR effective May 2021 extended from May 2020 which will supersede the current Medical Device Directives Medical devices which have a valid CE Certificate to the current Directives issued before May 2021 can continue to be sold until May 2024 or until the CE Certificate expires whichever comes first providing there are no significant changes to the design or intended use The CE Mark is applied following approval from an independent notified body or declaration of conformity The process of obtaining marketing approval or clearance from the FDA or by comparable agencies in foreign countries for new products or with respect to enhancements or modifications to existing products could  take a significant period of time  require the expenditure of substantial resources  involve rigorous preclinical and clinical testing as well as increased postmarket surveillance  require changes to products and  result in limitations on the indicated uses of products In addition exported devices are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country to which the device is exported Some countries do not have medical device regulations but in most foreign countries medical devices are regulated Frequently regulatory approval may first be obtained in a foreign country prior to application in the US due to differing regulatory requirements however other countries such as China for example require approval in the country of origin or legal manufacturer first Most countries outside of the US require that product approvals be renewed or recertified on a regular basis generally every four to five years The renewal or recertification process requires that we evaluate any device changes and any new regulations or standards relevant to the device and conduct appropriate testing to document continued compliance Where renewal or recertification applications are required they may need to be renewed andor approved in order to continue selling our products in those countries There can be no assurance that we will receive the required approvals for new products or modifications to existing products on a timely basis or that any approval will not be subsequently withdrawn or conditioned upon extensive postmarket study requirements Our global regulatory environment is becoming increasingly stringent and unpredictable which could increase the time cost and complexity of obtaining regulatory approvals for our products as well as the clinical and regulatory costs of supporting those approvals Several countries that did not have regulatory requirements for medical devices have established such requirements in recent years and other countries have expanded on existing regulations Certain regulators are exhibiting less flexibility and are requiring local preclinical and clinical data in addition to global data While harmonization of global regulations has been pursued requirements continue to differ significantly among countries We expect this global regulatory environment will continue to evolve which could impact our ability to obtain future approvals for our products or could increase the cost and time to obtain such approvals in the future The FDA and other worldwide regulatory agencies actively monitor compliance with local laws and regulations through review and inspection of design and manufacturing practices recordkeeping reporting of adverse events labeling and promotional practices The FDA can ban certain medical devices detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices order repair replacement or refund of these devices and require notification of health professionals and others with regard to medical devices that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health The FDA can take action against a company that promotes offlabel uses The FDA may also enjoin and restrain a company for certain violations of the FDC Act and other amending Acts pertaining to medical devices or initiate action for criminal prosecution of such violations Any adverse regulatory action depending on its magnitude may restrict a company from effectively marketing and selling its products may limit a companys ability to obtain future premarket clearances or approvals and could result in a substantial modification to our business practices and operations International sales of medical devices manufactured in the US that are not approved by the FDA for use in the US or that are banned or deviate from lawful performance standards are subject to FDA export requirements 31 Regulations regarding the development manufacture and sale of medical devices are evolving and subject to future change We cannot predict what impact if any those changes might have on our business Failure to comply with regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or manufacturer could result in fines delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances or approvals seizures or recalls of products physician advisories or other field actions operating restrictions andor criminal prosecution We may also initiate field actions as a result of a failure to strictly comply with our internal quality policies The failure to receive product approval clearance on a timely basis suspensions of regulatory clearances seizures or recalls of products physician advisories or other field actions or the withdrawal of product approval by the FDA or by comparable agencies in foreign countries could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations Our products are continually subject to clinical trials and other analyses conducted by us our competitors or other third parties the results of which may be unexpected or perceived as unfavorable by the market and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations As a part of the regulatory process of obtaining marketing clearance for new products and new indications for existing products we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials with a variety of study designs patient populations and trial endpoints Unexpected or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials or other analyses conducted by us by our competitors or by third parties including acquired businesses prior to acquisition by us or the FDAs or the markets perception of this clinical data may adversely impact our ability to obtain product approvals our position in and share of the markets in which we participate and our business financial condition results of operations or future prospects The medical device industry and its customers continue to face scrutiny and regulation by governmental authorities and are often the subject of numerous investigations often involving marketing and other business practices or product quality issues including device recalls or advisories These investigations could result in the commencement of civil and criminal proceedings imposition of substantial fines penalties and administrative remedies including corporate integrity agreements stipulated judgments or exclusion diversion of our employees and managements attention imposition of administrative costs and have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity and may lead to greater governmental regulation in the future The medical devices we design develop manufacture and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and numerous other federal state and foreign governmental authorities These authorities continue to closely scrutinize our industry We have received and in the future may receive subpoenas and other requests for information from Congress and state and federal governmental agencies including among others the US Department of Justice DOJ the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services HHS and the Department of Defense as well as from foreign governments and agencies The requests andor subpoenas we have received relate primarily to financial arrangements with healthcare providers regulatory compliance and sale andor product promotional practices We have cooperated with these subpoenas and other requests for information and expect to continue to do so in the future We cannot predict when a matter will be resolved the outcome of the matter or its impact on us and cooperation may involve significant costs including document production costs An adverse outcome in any matter could include the commencement of an investigation civil and criminal proceedings substantial fines penalties and administrative remedies including exclusion from government reimbursement programs entry into Corporate Integrity Agreements CIAs with governmental agencies and amendments to any existing CIAs In addition resolution of any matter could involve the imposition of additional and costly compliance obligations Cooperation with requests and investigations from external agencies result in employee resource costs and diversion of employee focus If any requests or investigations continue over a long period of time they could divert the attention of management from the daytoday operations of our business and impose significant additional administrative burdens on us These potential consequences as well as any adverse outcome from these requests or investigations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity In addition certain foreign governments state governments including that of Massachusetts where we are headquartered and the US federal government have enacted legislation aimed at increasing transparency of our interactions with healthcare providers As an example compliance with the US Physician Payment Sunshine Act requires us by law to disclose payments and other transfers of value to all US physicians and US teaching hospitals at the US federal level made after August 1 2013 Any failure to comply with these legal and regulatory requirements could impact our business In addition we have and may continue to devote substantial additional time and financial resources to further develop and implement enhanced structure policies systems and processes to comply with enhanced legal and regulatory requirements which may also impact our business We anticipate that governmental authorities will continue to scrutinize our industry closely and that additional regulation may increase compliance and legal cost and exposure to litigation and have additional adverse effects on our operations 32 Changes in tax laws unfavorable resolution of tax contingencies or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations andor liquidity We are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes and tariffs in both the US and various foreign jurisdictions We are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision and we have established contingency reserves for material known tax exposures However the calculation of such tax exposures involves the application of complex tax laws and regulations in many jurisdictions as well as interpretations as to the legality under European Union state aid rules of tax advantages granted in certain jurisdictions Therefore there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these disputes or other tax audits or that issues raised by tax authorities will be resolved at a financial cost that does not exceed our related reserves and the actual outcomes of these disputes and other tax audits could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition Changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation and application in the jurisdictions where we are subject to tax could materially impact our effective tax rate The US enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act TCJA on December 22 2017 and we expect the US Treasury to issue future notices and regulations under the TCJA Certain provisions of the TCJA and the regulations issued thereunder could have a significant impact on our future results of operations as could interpretations made by the Company in the absence of regulatory guidance and judicial interpretations The change in administration and control of Congress in the US may result in additional US tax law changes that could have a material impact on our future effective tax rate Additionally the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD the European Commission EC and individual taxing jurisdictions where we and our affiliates do business have recently focused on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations The OECD has released its comprehensive plan to create an agreed set of international rules for fighting base erosion and profit shifting In addition the OECD the EC and individual countries are examining changes to how taxing rights should be allocated among countries considering the digital economy As a result the tax laws in the US and other countries in which we and our affiliates do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis and any such changes could materially adversely affect our business Furthermore changes in customs laws and regulations in the US and various foreign jurisdictions could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition Our operations in Puerto Rico and Costa Rica presently benefit from various tax incentives and grants Unless these incentives and grants are extended they will expire between 2027 and 2035 If we are unable to renew extend or obtain new incentive and grants the expiration of the existing incentives and grants could have a material impact on our financial results in future periods We may not effectively be able to protect our intellectual property or other sensitive data which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations The medical device market in which we participate is largely technology driven Physician customers have historically moved quickly to new products and new technologies As a result intellectual property rights particularly patents and trade secrets play a significant role in product development and differentiation However intellectual property litigation is inherently complex and unpredictable and appellate courts can overturn lower court decisions Furthermore as our business increasingly relies on technology systems and infrastructure our intellectual property other proprietary technology and other sensitive data are potentially vulnerable to loss damage or misappropriation Finally our ability to protect novel business models is uncertain Competing parties in our industry frequently file multiple suits to leverage patent portfolios across product lines technologies and geographies and to balance risk and exposure between the parties In some cases several competitors are parties in the same proceeding or in a series of related proceedings or litigate multiple features of a single class of devices These forces frequently drive settlement not only of individual cases but also of a series of pending and potentially related and unrelated cases In addition although monetary and injunctive relief is typically sought remedies and restitution are generally not determined until the conclusion of the trial court proceedings and can be modified on appeal Accordingly the outcomes of individual cases are difficult to time predict or quantify and are often dependent upon the outcomes of other cases in other geographies A number of third parties have asserted that our current and former product offerings infringe patents owned or licensed by them We have similarly asserted that products sold by our competitors infringe patents owned or licensed by us Adverse outcomes in one or more of the proceedings against us could limit our ability to sell certain products in certain jurisdictions or reduce our operating margin on the sale of these products and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 33 Patents and other proprietary rights are and will continue to be essential to our business and our ability to compete effectively with other companies will be dependent upon the proprietary nature of our technologies We rely upon trade secrets knowhow continuing technological innovations strategic alliances and licensing opportunities to develop maintain and strengthen our competitive position We pursue a policy of generally obtaining patent protection in both the US and abroad for patentable subject matter in our proprietary devices and attempt to review thirdparty patents and patent applications to the extent publicly available in order to develop an effective patent strategy avoid infringement of thirdparty patents identify licensing opportunities and monitor the patent claims of others We own numerous US and foreign patents and have numerous patent applications pending We also are party to license agreements pursuant to which patent rights have been obtained or granted in consideration for cash crosslicensing rights or royalty payments No assurance can be made that any pending or future patent applications will result in the issuance of patents that any current or future patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged or circumvented by our competitors or that our patents will not be found invalid In addition we may have to take legal action in the future to protect our patents trade secrets or knowhow or to assert them against claimed infringement by others Any legal action of that type could be costly and time consuming and no assurances can be made that any lawsuit will be successful We are generally involved as both a plaintiff and a defendant in a number of patent infringement and other intellectual propertyrelated actions The invalidation of key patents or proprietary rights that we own or an unsuccessful outcome in lawsuits to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations In addition the laws of certain countries in which we market and plan on manufacturing some of our products in the near future do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the US If we are unable to protect our intellectual property in these countries it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations Furthermore our intellectual property other proprietary technology and other sensitive data are potentially vulnerable to loss damage or misappropriation from system malfunction computer viruses and unauthorized access to our data or misappropriation or misuse thereof by those with permitted access and other events While we have invested to protect our intellectual property products and other data and continue to work diligently in this area there can be no assurance that our precautionary measures will prevent breakdowns breaches cyberattacks or other events Such events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition or results of operations We rely on the proper function availability and security of information technology systems to operate our business and a cyberattack or other breach of these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations We rely on information technology systems including technology from third party vendors to process transmit and store electronic information in our daytoday operations Similar to other large multinational companies the size and complexity of our information technology systems makes them vulnerable to a cyberattack malicious intrusion breakdown destruction loss of data privacy or other significant disruption Our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology evolving systems and regulatory standards the increasing need to protect patient and customer information and changing customer patterns In addition third parties may attempt to hack into our products to obtain data relating to patients or disrupt performance of our products or to access our proprietary information and the technology from third party vendors that we rely upon may have defects or vulnerabilities which in turn create vulnerabilities or disruptions in our system Any failure by us to maintain or protect our information technology systems products and data integrity including from cyberattacks intrusions or other breaches could result in the unauthorized access to patient data and personally identifiable information theft of intellectual property or other misappropriation of assets or otherwise compromise our confidential or proprietary information and disrupt our operations or in the worst case could result in harm to patients Such failure or demonstration of vulnerability to such failure may also result in additional regulatory scrutiny We also grow our company through acquisitions and may face risks associated with defects and vulnerabilities in their systems as we work to integrate the acquisitions into our information technology system In the US federal and state privacy and security laws require certain of our operations to protect the confidentiality of personal information including patient medical records and other health information and to comply with other requirements with respect to personal data In Europe the Data Protection Directive requires us to manage individually identifiable information in the EU and the new General Data Protection Regulation GDPR may impose fines of up to four percent of our global revenue Internationally some countries have also passed laws that require individually identifiable data on their citizens to be maintained on local servers and that may restrict transfer or processing of that data We believe that we meet the expectations of applicable regulations and that the ongoing costs and impacts of ensuring compliance with such rules are not material to our 34 business However there is no guarantee that we will avoid enforcement actions by governmental bodies or civil actions based on this growing body of regulations Enforcement actions could be costly and interrupt regular operations of our business Any of these events in turn may cause us to lose existing customers have difficulty preventing detecting and controlling fraud have disputes with customers physicians and other healthcare professionals be subject to legal claims and liability have regulatory sanctions or penalties imposed have increases in operating expenses incur expenses or lose revenues as a result of a data privacy breach or theft of intellectual property or suffer other adverse consequences any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations Pending and future intellectual property litigation could be costly and disruptive to us We operate in an industry that is susceptible to significant intellectual property litigation and in recent years it has been common for companies in the medical device field to aggressively challenge the patent rights of other companies We are currently the subject of various patent litigation proceedings and other proceedings described in more detail under Note K  Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report  Intellectual property litigation is expensive complex and lengthy and its outcome is difficult to predict Adverse outcomes in one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell certain products and on our operating margins financial condition results of operation or liquidity Pending or future patent litigation may result in significant royalty or other payments or injunctions that can prevent the sale of products and may significantly divert the attention of our technical and management personnel In the event that our right to market any of our products is successfully challenged we may be required to obtain a license on terms which may not be favorable to us if at all If we fail to obtain a required license or are unable to design around a patent our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected Pending and future product liability claims and other litigation including private securities litigation stockholder derivative suits and contract litigation may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations or liquidity The design manufacturing and marketing of medical devices of the types that we produce entail an inherent risk of product liability claims Many of the medical devices that we manufacture and market are designed to be implanted in the human body for long periods of time or indefinitely A number of factors could result in an unsafe condition or injury to or death of a patient with respect to these or other products that we manufacture or sell including physician technique and experience in performing the surgical procedure component failures manufacturing flaws design defects offlabel use or inadequate disclosure of productrelated risks or productrelated information These factors could result in product liability claims a recall of one or more of our products or a safety alert relating to one or more of our products Product liability claims may be brought by individuals or by groups seeking to represent a class We are currently the subject of product liability litigation proceedings and other proceedings described in more detail under Note K  Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report  The outcome of litigation particularly class action lawsuits is difficult to assess or quantify Plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits often seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts including not only actual damages but also punitive damages The magnitude of the potential losses relating to these lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time In addition the cost to defend against any future litigation may be significant Product liability claims securities and commercial litigation and other litigation in the future regardless of the outcome could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity Additionally we maintain an insurance policy providing limited coverage against securities claims and we are substantially selfinsured with respect to product liability claims and fully selfinsured with respect to intellectual property infringement claims The fact that we do not maintain thirdparty insurance coverage for all categories of losses increases our exposure to unanticipated claims and adverse decisions and these losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity Any failure to meet regulatory quality standards applicable to our manufacturing and quality processes could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations As a medical device manufacturer we are required to register our establishments and list our devices with the FDA and are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA for compliance with its Quality System Regulation requirements which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations including testing quality control and documentation procedures In addition the Federal Medical Device Reporting regulations require us to provide information to the FDA whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or if a malfunction were to occur could cause or contribute to a death or serious injury Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is monitored rigorously through periodic inspections by the FDA which may result in observations on Form 483 and in some cases warning letters that require corrective action In the European 35 Community we are required to maintain certain International Standards Organization ISO certifications in order to sell our products and must undergo periodic inspections by notified bodies to obtain and maintain these certifications Many other countries in which we do business have requirements similar to those of the US or the EU and other foreign governments or agencies may subject us to periodic inspections as well If we or our manufacturers fail to adhere to quality system regulations or ISO requirements this could delay production of our products and lead to fines difficulties in obtaining regulatory clearances recalls enforcement actions including injunctive relief or consent decrees or other consequences which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations Our business could be negatively impacted by corporate social responsibility and sustainability matters In recent years there has been an increased focus from certain investors customers employees and other stakeholders concerning corporate social responsibility and sustainability matters From time to time we announce certain initiatives including goals regarding our focus areas which include environmental matters responsible sourcing social investments and diversity equity and inclusion We could fail or be perceived to fail in our achievement of such initiatives or goals or we could fail in accurately reporting our progress on such initiatives and goals Such failures could be due to changes in our business Moreover the standards by which corporate social responsibility and sustainability efforts and related matters are measured are developing and evolving and certain areas are subject to assumptions that could change over time In addition we could be criticized for the scope of such initiatives or goals or perceived as not acting responsibly in connection with these matters Any such matters or related corporate social responsibility and sustainability matters could have a material adverse impact on our future results of
