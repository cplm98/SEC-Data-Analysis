PART I Item 1 Business Our mission is to help people experience the world We operate six primary brands  Bookingcom  the worlds leading brand for booking online accommodation reservations based on room nights booked  pricelinecom  a leading hotel rental car airline ticket and vacation package reservation service in the United States  KAYAK  a leading metasearch service allowing consumers to easily search and compare travel itineraries and prices including airline ticket accommodation and rental car reservation information from hundreds of travel websites at once  agodacom  a leading accommodation reservation service catering primarily to consumers in the AsiaPacific region  Rentalcarscom  a leading worldwide rental car reservation service  OpenTable  a leading provider of restaurant reservation and information services to consumers and restaurant reservation management and customer acquisition services to restaurants Our business is driven primarily by international results which consist of the results of Bookingcom agodacom and Rentalcarscom which began operating as part of Bookingcom on January 1 2018 and the international businesses of KAYAK and OpenTable This classification is independent of where the consumer resides where the consumer is physically located while using our services or the location of the travel service provider or restaurant For example a reservation made through Bookingcom at a hotel in New York by a consumer in the United States is part of our international results During the year ended December 31 2017  our international business the substantial majority of which is generated by Bookingcom represented approximately 89 of our consolidated gross profit A significant majority of our gross profit is earned in connection with facilitating accommodation reservations See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more geographic information Booking Holdings Inc was formed as a Delaware limited liability company in 1997 and was converted into a Delaware corporation named pricelinecom Incorporated in July 1998 On April 1 2014 the Company changed its name from pricelinecom Incorporated to The Priceline Group Inc and on February 21 2018 the Company changed its name to Booking Holdings Inc Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol BKNG and traded under the symbol PCLN prior to February 27 2018 Our principal executive offices are located at 800 Connecticut Avenue Norwalk Connecticut 06854 We refer to our company and all of our subsidiaries and brands collectively as Booking Holdings the Company we our or us The Booking Holdings Business Model We derive substantially all of our revenues and gross profit from the following sources  Commissions earned from facilitating reservations of accommodations rental cars and other travel services on an agency basis 1  Transaction gross profit on a merchant basis and customer processing fees from our accommodation rental car airline ticket and vacation package reservation services  Advertising revenues primarily earned by KAYAK from sending referrals to online travel companies OTCs and travel service providers as well as from advertising placements on KAYAKs websites and mobile apps  Reservation revenues paid by restaurants for diners seated through OpenTables online reservation services subscription fees for restaurant reservation management services provided by OpenTable and  Damage excess waiver fees travel insurance fees and global distribution system GDS reservation booking fees in each case related to certain of our travel services Our pricelinecom brand offers merchant Name Your Own Price  opaque travel services which are recorded in revenue on a gross basis and have associated cost of revenue All of our other services are generally recorded in revenue on a net basis and have no significant associated cost of revenue Therefore revenue increases and decreases are impacted by changes in the mix of our revenues between Name Your Own Price  travel services and other services Gross profit reflects the commission or net margin earned for all of our services Consequently gross profit is an important measure to evaluate growth in our business because in contrast to our revenues it is not affected by the different methods of recording revenue and cost of revenue between our Name Your Own Price  travel reservation services and our other services On January 1 2018 we adopted a new revenue recognition accounting standard which will change the presentation of our Name Your Own Price  revenue to a net basis see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for periods beginning after December 31 2017 and as a result we will no longer report cost of revenues or gross profit For the year ended December 31 2017  we had gross profit of approximately 124 billion comprised of agency gross profit merchant gross profit and advertising and other gross profit Agency gross profit is derived from travelrelated transactions where we do not facilitate payments for the travel services provided Agency gross profit which represented the majority of our total gross profit in 2017  consists primarily of 1 travel reservation commissions 2 certain GDS reservation booking fees and 3 certain travel insurance fees Merchant gross profit is derived from services where we facilitate payments for the travel services provided and consists of 1 transaction gross profit representing the amount charged to a consumer less the amount charged to us by travel service providers and merchant travel reservation commissions 2 transaction revenues representing the price of Name Your Own Price  reservations charged to a customer with a corresponding travel service provider cost recorded in cost of revenues 3 ancillary fees including damage excess waiver and certain travel insurance fees and certain GDS reservation booking fees and 4 customer processing fees Advertising and other revenues are derived primarily from 1 revenues earned by KAYAK for a sending referrals to OTCs and travel service providers and b advertising placements on KAYAKs websites and mobile apps 2 revenues earned by OpenTable for a reservation fees paid by restaurants for diners seated through OpenTables online reservation services and b subscription fees earned by OpenTable for restaurant reservation management services 3 revenues earned by pricelinecom for advertising on its websites and 4 revenues generated by Bookingcoms BookingSuite branded accommodation marketing and business analytics services See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information The Booking Holdings Strategy We aim to achieve our mission to help people experience the world through global leadership in online travel and restaurant reservation and related services by  providing consumers with the best choices and prices at any time in any place on any device  making it easy for people to find book and experience their travel desires and  providing platforms tools and insights to our business partners to help them be successful We focus on relentless innovation and execution and a commitment to serve both consumers and our travel service provider and restaurant partners with unmatched service and bestinclass digital technology The online travel and dining categories continue to grow as consumer purchasing shifts from traditional offline channels to interactive online channels including mobile channels Our strategy is to continue to participate broadly in this online growth by expanding our service offerings and markets In particular we aim to be the world leader in online travel and restaurant reservation and related services by a leveraging technology to provide consumers with the best experience b partnering with travel service providers and restaurants to our mutual benefit c operating entrepreneurial brands that collaborate and share best practices and d investing in profitable and sustainable growth  Providing the best consumer experience  We believe that offering consumers an outstanding online experience is essential for our future success To accomplish this we focus on providing consumers with a a variety of intuitive easytouse online travel and restaurant reservation and search services b a continually increasing number location and variety of accommodations and restaurants available through our services c informative 2 and useful content such as pictures accommodation and restaurant details and reviews and d excellent customer service Our goal is to make travel easy frictionless and personal and to offer consumers the most trusted brand the most personalized experience and the most extensive varied and comprehensive accommodation selection in every geography at the best prices For example Bookingcom increasingly provides reservation services for accommodations other than hotels Bookingcom included approximately 1586000 properties on its website as of December 31 2017 consisting of approximately 396000 hotels motels and resorts and approximately 1190000 homes apartments and other unique places to stay updated property counts are available on the Bookingcom website Further we endeavor to provide excellent customer service in a variety of ways including through our call centers and websites so that consumers can be confident that booking reservations through us will lead to a positive experience We are constantly innovating in order to provide a bestinclass user experience with intuitive easytouse websites and mobile apps to ensure that we are meeting the needs of online consumers while aiming to exceed their expectations  Partnering with travel service providers and restaurants We aim to establish mutually beneficial relationships with travel service providers and restaurants around the world We believe that travel service providers and restaurants benefit from participating in our services by increasing their distribution channels demand and inventory utilization in an efficient and costeffective manner Travel service providers and restaurants benefit from our wellknown brands and online marketing efforts expertise in offering an excellent consumer experience through our websites and mobile apps and ability to offer their inventory in markets and to consumers that the travel service provider or restaurant may be unable or unlikely to reach For example an independent hotel may not have the means or expertise to market itself to international travelers including in other languages to build and operate effective desktop and mobile websites and online reservation services or to engage in sophisticated online marketing techniques Further we are increasingly providing services other than reservations booked through our websites and mobile apps designed to help our partners grow their businesses For example Bookingcoms BookingSuite services are designed to offer accommodation providers with affordable marketing and business analytics tools to help them attract customers and more effectively manage their properties Similarly OpenTable is continuously working to improve its reservation management software services to help restaurants more effectively manage their reservations and more efficiently market their available tables to diners  Maintaining multiple brands We employ a strategy of operating multiple brands which we believe allows us the opportunity to offer our reservation services in ways that appeal to different consumers pursue different marketing and business strategies encourage experimentation and innovation provide different service offerings and focus on different markets while benefiting all of our brands from opportunities to share best practices and learning and to collaborate We intend to invest resources to support organic growth by all of our brands whether through increased advertising geographic expansion technology innovation or increased access to accommodations rental cars restaurants or other services For example we spend significant and increasing amounts on performance and brand advertising to acquire customers and establish and strengthen our brands We intend to continue efforts to share best practices access to travel service provider offerings and customers across our brands and to collaborate where appropriate to benefit consumers For example on January 1 2018 we integrated our Rentalcarscom business into Bookingcom which we believe will enable us to more effectively offer Rentalcarscoms services to address the ground transportation needs of Bookingcoms customers In addition Bookingcom offers consumers flight search capabilities provided by KAYAK and restaurant reservation services provided by OpenTable We believe that by promoting our brands worldwide sharing accommodation reservation availability and customer demand and applying our industry experiences across brands and markets we can more effectively expand our reservation services globally and maintain and grow our position as a leading provider of worldwide online travel and restaurant reservation and related services  Investing in profitable and sustainable growth We seek to offer online services that meet the needs and the expectations of consumers travel service providers and restaurants and that we believe will result in longterm profitability and growth We intend to accomplish this through continuous investment and innovation growing our businesses in new and current markets expanding our services and ensuring that we provide an appealing intuitive and easytouse consumer experience through our websites and mobile apps We have made significant investments in people technology advertising and expanded new or additional services such as increasing our extensive collection of accommodations including homes apartments and other unique places to stay insurance products and other offerings We also may pursue strategic transactions For example in 2017 we expanded our KAYAK metasearch business in particular in Europe through the acquisition of the Momondo Group We regularly evaluate and may pursue and consummate other potential strategic acquisitions partnerships joint ventures or investments whether to expand our businesses into complementary areas expand our current 3 businesses acquire innovative technology or for other reasons For example we have a commercial relationship with and have made significant financial investments in Ctrip a leading OTC operating primarily in China Service Offerings Through our online travel reservation services we connect consumers wishing to make travel reservations with providers of travel services around the world We offer consumers a broad array of accommodation reservations including hotels motels resorts homes apartments bed and breakfasts hostels and other properties through our Bookingcom pricelinecom and agodacom brands Our pricelinecom brand also offers consumers reservations for rental cars airline tickets vacation packages and cruises We offer rental car reservations worldwide through our Rentalcarscom and Bookingcom brands We also allow consumers to easily compare travel reservation information such as airline ticket hotel reservation and rental car reservation information from hundreds of travel websites at once through KAYAK We provide restaurants with reservation management and customer acquisition services and consumers with the ability to make restaurant reservations at participating restaurants through OpenTable Bookingcom Bookingcom is the worlds leading brand for booking online accommodation reservations based on room nights booked with operations worldwide and headquarters in the Netherlands As of December 31 2017 Bookingcom offered accommodation reservation services for approximately 1586000 properties in over 220 countries and territories on its various websites and in over 40 languages consisting of approximately 396000 hotels motels and resorts and approximately 1190000 homes apartments and other unique places to stay updated property counts are available on the Bookingcom website Accommodation providers participate in Bookingcom which operates primarily under an agency model by filing rates and information about the property in Bookingcoms proprietary extranet In addition Bookingcom offers website and other marketing services and business analytics to accommodation providers as part of its BookingSuite initiative Bookingcom has expanded its offerings to better help consumers experience the world For example Bookingcom has begun offering tours and activities in certain markets On January 1 2018 we began operating our Rentalcarscom business as part of Bookingcom to more effectively offer Rentalcarcoms rental car and other ground transportation services to Bookingcoms customers Bookingcom offers online rental car reservation services on Bookingcom and Rentalcarscom primarily under a merchant model allowing consumers to make rental car reservations in approximately 53000 locations throughout the world with customer support in over 40 languages Bookingcom also offers prebooked taxi and black car services on Bookingcom and Rentalcarscom at over 900 airports throughout the world In addition Bookingcom offers consumers flight search capabilities provided by KAYAK and restaurant reservation services provided by OpenTable Pricelinecom Pricelinecom offers online travel reservation services primarily in the United States and is headquartered in Norwalk Connecticut Through pricelinecom we offer consumers hotel rental car and airline ticket reservation services as well as vacation packages and cruises Pricelinecom is a leader in the discount travel reservation business including through its pioneering Name Your Own Price  and Express Deals  opaque offerings where certain elements of the service including the identity of the travel service provider are not disclosed to the consumer prior to making a reservation We believe that the combination of pricelinecoms retail and opaque models allows it to provide a broad array of options to valueconscious consumers Pricelinecom operates under both a merchant and agency model KAYAK KAYAK headquartered in Stamford Connecticut provides an online price comparison service often referred to as metasearch that allows consumers to easily search and compare travel itineraries and prices including airline ticket accommodation reservation and rental car reservation information from hundreds of travel websites at once KAYAK derives revenues from sending referrals to OTCs and travel service providers and from advertising placements on its websites and mobile apps KAYAK offers its services in over 60 countries with the United States being its largest market through various websites including Momondo and Cheapflights websites we acquired in 2017 Agodacom Agodacom is a leading online accommodation reservation service catering primarily to consumers in the AsiaPacific region with headquarters in Singapore and operations in Bangkok Thailand and throughout the region Accommodation providers participate in agodacom which operates primarily under a merchant model by filing rates and information about the property in agodacoms proprietary extranet OpenTable OpenTable is a leading brand for booking online restaurant reservations Headquartered in San Francisco California OpenTable provides online restaurant reservation services to consumers and reservation management services to restaurants OpenTable does business primarily in the United States though it continues to invest in expanding its international offerings 4 Marketing and Brand Awareness We have established widely used and recognized ecommerce brands through marketing and promotional campaigns Both our performance advertising expense and brand advertising expense have increased significantly in recent years a trend we expect to continue During 2017 our total performance advertising expense was approximately 41 billion  primarily related to the use of online search engines primarily Google metasearch and travel research services and affiliate marketing to generate traffic to our websites We also invested approximately 392 million in brand advertising during 2017 We intend to continue a strategy of promoting brand awareness through both online and offline advertising efforts including by expanding brand campaigns into additional markets We expense the substantial majority of our advertising activities as the expense is incurred which is typically in the quarter in which reservations are booked but have recognized most of our gross profit when the consumers travel or dining experience is completed Beginning January 1 2018 we will recognize revenue for our travel reservation services on a checkin basis such that revenue will be recognized upon checkin at an accommodation pickup of a rental car or boarding of a flight In either case as a result of this timing difference between when advertising expense is incurred and revenue or gross profit is recognized advertising expense may not be recognized in the same period as the associated revenue or gross profit Competition We compete globally with both online and traditional travel and restaurant reservation and related services The markets for the services we offer are and are expected to remain intensely competitive and current and new competitors can launch new services at a relatively low cost Some of our current and potential competitors such as Google Apple Alibaba Tencent Amazon and Facebook have access to significantly greater and more diversified resources than we do and they may be able to leverage other aspects of their businesses eg search or mobile device businesses to enable them to compete more effectively with us For example Google has entered various aspects of the online travel market including by establishing a flight metasearch product Google Flights and a hotel metasearch business Google Hotel Ads that are growing rapidly as well as its Book on Google reservation functionality and its Google Trips app We currently or may potentially in the future compete with a variety of companies including  online travel reservation services such as Expedia Hotelscom Hotwire Orbitz Travelocity Wotif Cheaptickets ebookers HotelClub RatesToGo and CarRentalscom which are owned by Expedia Hotel Reservation Service HRS and hotelde which are owned by Hotel Reservation Service and AutoEurope CarTrawler Ctrip in which we hold a minority interest eLong in which Ctrip holds a significant minority interest ezTravel in which Ctrip holds a majority interest Meituan in which we hold a small minority interest MakeMyTrip OYO Rooms Yatra Cleartrip Traveloka in which Expedia holds a minority interest Webjet Rakuten Jalan which is owned by Recruit ViajaNet Submarino Viagens DespegarDecolar in which Expedia holds a minority ownership interest Fliggy operated by Alibaba 17ucom HotelTonight CheapOair and eDreams ODIGEO  online accommodation search andor reservation services such as Airbnb HomeAway which is owned by Expedia and Tujia in which Ctrip and Expedia hold investments currently focused primarily on alternative accommodations including individually owned properties such as homes and apartments  large online companies including search social networking and marketplace companies such as Google Facebook Alibaba Tencent Amazon and Baidu  traditional travel agencies travel management companies wholesalers and tour operators many of which combine physical locations telephone services and online services such as Carlson Wagonlit American Express BCD Travel Concur which is owned by SAP Thomas Cook TUI and Hotelbeds which recently acquired Tourico and GTA as well as thousands of individual travel agencies around the world  travel service providers such as accommodation providers rental car companies and airlines many of which have their own branded websites to which they drive business including large hotel chains such as Marriott International Hilton and Hyatt Hotels as well as joint efforts by travel service providers such as Room Key an online hotel reservation service owned by several major hotel companies  online travel search and price comparison services generally referred to as metasearch services such as Google Flights Google Hotel Ads TripAdvisor trivago in which Expedia holds a majority interest Qunar which is controlled by Ctrip Skyscanner in which Ctrip holds a majority interest and HotelsCombined 5  online restaurant reservation services such as TripAdvisors LaFourchette Yelps SeatMe Zomato Bookatable which is owned by Michelin Quandoo which is owned by Recruit and Resy in which Airbnb holds a minority interest  companies offering new rental car business models or car or ridesharing services that affect demand for rental cars some of which have developed innovative technologies to improve efficiency of pointtopoint transportation and extensively utilize mobile platforms such as Uber Lyft Gett Zipcar which is owned by Avis BlaBlaCar Didi Chuxing Grab and Ola and  companies offering technology services and software solutions to accommodation providers including large global distribution systems or GDSs such as Amadeus and Sabre Google the worlds largest search engine and one of the worlds largest companies and other large established companies with substantial resources and expertise in developing online commerce and facilitating Internet traffic have launched search metasearch andor reservation booking services and may create additional inroads into online travel Googles travel metasearch services Google Hotel Ads and Google Flights are growing rapidly and have achieved significant market share in a relatively short time Metasearch services leverage their search technology to aggregate travel search results for the consumers specific itinerary across travel service provider eg accommodations rental car companies or airlines OTC and other travel websites and in many instances compete directly with us for customers Metasearch services intend to appeal to consumers by showing broader travel search results than may be available through OTCs or other travel websites which could lead to travel service providers or others gaining a larger share of search traffic TripAdvisor and trivago two other leading metasearch companies support their metasearch services with significant brand and performance advertising Through our KAYAK metasearch service we compete directly with other metasearch services Further metasearch services may evolve into more traditional OTCs by offering consumers the ability to make travel reservations directly through their websites For example TripAdvisor allows consumers to make a reservation on TripAdvisor at some accommodations through its Instant Booking offering which includes participation by many of the leading global hotel chains There has been a proliferation of new channels through which accommodation providers can offer reservations For example companies such as Airbnb and HomeAway which is owned by Expedia offer services providing alternative accommodation property owners particularly individuals an online place to list their accommodations where travelers can search and book such properties and compete directly with our alternative accommodation services In addition Airbnb has begun offering hotel reservations through its online and mobile platforms Travel service providers including hotel chains rental car companies and airlines with which we conduct business compete with us in online channels to drive consumers to their own websites in lieu of thirdparty distributors such as us Travel service providers may charge lower prices and in some instances offer advantages such as loyalty points or special discounts to members of closed user groups such as loyalty program participants or customers with registered accounts any of which could make their offerings more attractive to consumers than our services Further consolidation among travel service providers such as Marriott Internationals acquisition of Starwood Hotels  Resorts could result in lower rates of commission paid to OTCs increased discounting and greater incentives for consumers to join closed user groups as such travel service providers expand their offerings Googles Android operating system is the leading smartphone operating system in the world As a result Google could leverage its Android operating system to give its travel services a competitive advantage either technically or with prominence on its Google Play app store or within its mobile search results Further Google is the leading Internet search service and has leveraged its search popularity to promote its travel metasearch services Similarly Apple the producer of among other things the iPhone and iPad obtained a patent for iTravel a mobile app that would allow a traveler to check in for a travel reservation In addition Apples iPhone operating system includes Wallet a virtual wallet app that holds tickets boarding passes coupons and gift cards and along with iTravel may be indicative of Apples intent to enter the travel reservations business in some capacity Apple has substantial market share in the smartphone category and controls integration of offerings including travel services into its mobile operating system Apple also has more experience producing and developing mobile apps and has access to greater resources than we have Apple may use expand andor integrate iTravel Wallet Siri Apples voice recognition concierge service Apple Pay Apples mobile payment system or another mobile app or functionality as a means of entering the travel reservations marketplace To the extent Apple or Google use their mobile operating systems app distribution channels or in the case of Google search services to favor their own travel service offerings our business and results of operations could be harmed 6 Operations and Technology Our business is supported by multiple systems and platforms which were designed with an emphasis on scalability performance and reliability The platforms are generally independent among our brands though some systems have become increasingly connected or shared Our software platforms and architecture use a variety of widelyused software tools and database systems These internal platforms were designed to include open application protocol interfaces that can provide connectivity to vendors in the industries in which we operate These include large global systems such as accommodation airline ticket and rental car reservation systems and financial service providers as well as individual accommodation service providers such as individual hotels Our applications utilize digital certificates to help us conduct secure communications and transactions as appropriate The systems infrastructure and web and database servers of our worldwide operations are primarily hosted in the United Kingdom Switzerland the Netherlands Germany Singapore Hong Kong and four locations in the United States each of which provides network connectivity networking infrastructure and 24hour monitoring and engineering support typical of hosted data centers All data center facilities have a continuous power supply system generators redundant servers and multiple backup systems Although we take steps to mitigate the effects of any loss or reduction in service at one of our hosting facilities if a hosting facility were inaccessible or otherwise experienced a disruption in service for any reason we could experience a disruption to our services loss of transactions and revenue and consumer complaints We provide customer service through a mix of inhouse call centers and outsourced thirdparty services Intellectual Property Over time and through acquisitions we have assembled a portfolio of patents trademarks service marks copyrights domain names and trade secrets covering our services We regard the protection of our intellectual property as critical to our success We protect our intellectual property rights by relying on national federal state and common law rights in the United States and internationally as well as a variety of administrative procedures regulations conventions and treaties We also rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights in our services We enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with employees and contractors and nondisclosure agreements with parties with whom we conduct business in order to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information We also have procured various intellectual property licenses from third parties As we deem appropriate we pursue the registration of our intellectual property such as domain names trademarks and service marks in the United States and internationally We currently hold various issued patents and pending patent applications We file additional patent applications on new inventions as we deem appropriate Effective trademark copyright patent domain name trade dress and trade secret protection is expensive to maintain and may require litigation As we continue to expand internationally protecting our intellectual property rights and other proprietary rights involves an increasing number of jurisdictions a process that is expensive and timeconsuming and may not be successful in every location See Part I Item 1A Risk Factors   We face risks related to our intellectual property  Seasonality A meaningful amount of our gross bookings are generated early in the year as customers plan and reserve their spring and summer vacations in Europe and North America However historically we generally have not recognized revenue from these bookings until the travel is completed on checkout which can be in a quarter other than when the reservation is booked Beginning on January 1 2018 we began recognizing revenue for financial reporting purposes in our 2018 financial statements when the travel begins on checkin which can also be in a quarter other than when the reservation is booked In contrast we expense the substantial majority of our advertising activities as the expense is incurred which in the case of performance advertising in particular is typically in the quarter in which associated reservations are booked As a result of this potential timing difference between when we record advertising expense and when we recognize associated revenue we have historically experienced our highest levels of profitability in the second and third quarters of the year which is when we experience the highest levels of accommodation checkouts for the year for our European and North American businesses We expect this to continue under our new revenue recognition policy The first quarter of the year is typically our lowest level of profitability and may experience volatility in earnings growth rates due to these and other seasonal timing factors For our AsiaPacific business we experience the highest levels of accommodation bookings in the third and fourth quarters of the year and the highest levels of travel consumption in the fourth quarter As the relative growth rates for these businesses fluctuate the quarterly distribution of our operating results may vary 7 In recent years we experienced an expansion of the booking window the average time between the making of a travel reservation and the travel which impacts the relationship between our gross bookings recognized at the time of booking and our revenue and gross profit recognized at the time of checkout or after January 1 2018 at the time of checkin Recently we have seen a modest contraction of the booking window Future changes in the booking window may cause additional differences between our gross bookings growth rates and revenue growth rates Upon adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standard for periods beginning after December 31 2017 the timing of revenue recognition for travel reservation services will change For example revenue for accommodation reservation services which is primarily recognized at checkout under the current accounting standard will change to be recognized at checkin under the new revenue standard We currently expect this timing change will not have a significant impact to our annual revenues and net income although the effects on quarterly revenues and net income are expected to be more significant because a meaningful amount of travel typically starts in December each year and is completed in January of the following year Under the new revenue standard this revenue will be recognized in the fourth quarter each year rather than the first quarter of the following year Therefore we estimate that revenue will be more than 2 lower in first quarter of 2018 slightly less than 1 lower in second and third quarters of 2018 and 4 higher in fourth quarter of 2018 recognized at checkin as it is under the new revenue standard than it would have been if recognized at checkout as it would have been under the current accounting standard In addition the date on which certain holidays fall can have an impact on our quarterly results For example in 2017 our second quarter yearoveryear growth rates in revenue gross profit operating income and operating margins were positively impacted by Easter falling in the second quarter instead of the first quarter as it did in 2016 Conversely our first quarter 2017 yearoveryear growth rates in revenue gross profit operating income and operating margins were adversely impacted by Easter falling in the second quarter instead of the first quarter as it did in 2016 Similar to 2017 in 2018 Easter will fall in the second quarter instead of the first quarter However because Easter will be on April 1 2018 and we expect that a meaningful amount of Easter travel will commence in the week leading up to Easter which is during the first quarter 2018 we expect that Easter will have a negative effect on our second quarter 2018 yearoveryear growth rates and a positive effect on our first quarter 2018 yearoveryear growth rates due to the change in our revenue recognition policy from checkout to checkin The timing of other holidays such as Chinese New Year Carnival and Ramadan can also impact our quarterly yearoveryear growth rates The impact of seasonality can be exaggerated in the short term by the gross bookings growth rate of the business For example in periods where our gross bookings growth rate substantially decelerates our operating margins typically benefit from relatively less variable advertising expense In addition gross profit growth is typically less impacted by decelerating gross bookings growth in the near term due to the benefit of revenue related to reservations booked in previous quarters Conversely in periods where our gross bookings growth rate accelerates our operating margins are typically negatively impacted by relatively more variable advertising expense In addition gross profit growth is typically less impacted by accelerating gross bookings growth in the near term as a portion of the revenue recognized from such gross bookings will occur in future quarters Employees As of December 31 2017  we employed approximately 22900 employees of which approximately 4200 were based in the United States and approximately 18700 were based outside the United States We also retain independent contractors to support our customer service website content translation and system support functions We have never had a work stoppage and we consider our relations with our employees to be good Although we have works councils or employee representatives in certain countries our US employees are not represented by a labor union and are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement Our future success will depend in part on our ability to continue to attract integrate retain and motivate highly qualified technical and managerial personnel for whom competition is intense See Part I Item 1A Risk Factors  We rely on the performance of highly skilled personnel and if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel or hire retain and motivate qualified personnel our business would be harmed  8 Company Websites We maintain websites with the addresses wwwbookingholdingscom wwwbookingcom wwwpricelinecom wwwkayakcom wwwagodacom wwwrentalcarscom wwwopentablecom and wwwmomondocom among others We are not including the information contained on our

and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business results of operations or financial condition If any of the following risks occur our business financial condition operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected Declines or disruptions in the travel industry could adversely affect our business and financial performance Our financial results and prospects are almost entirely dependent upon the sale of travel services Travel including accommodation including hotels motels resorts homes apartments bed and breakfasts hostels and other properties rental car and airline ticket reservations is significantly dependent on discretionary spending levels As a result sales of travel services tend to decline during general economic downturns and recessions and times of political or economic uncertainty as consumers engage in less discretionary spending are concerned about unemployment or inflation have reduced access to credit or experience other concerns or effects that reduce their ability or willingness to travel Perceived or actual adverse economic conditions including slow slowing or negative economic growth unemployment rates inflation and weakening currencies and concerns over government responses such as higher taxes and reduced government spending could impair consumer spending and adversely affect travel demand Political uncertainty conditions or events such as the United Kingdoms decision to leave the European Union Brexit and concerns regarding certain EU members with sovereign debt default risks can also negatively affect consumer spending and adversely affect travel demand At times we have experienced volatility in transaction growth rates increased cancellation rates and weaker trends in hotel average daily rates ADRs across many regions of the world particularly in those countries that appear to be most affected by economic and political uncertainties which we believe are due at least in part to these macroeconomic conditions and concerns Economic or political disruptions could cause contribute to or be indicative of deteriorating macroeconomic conditions which in turn could negatively affect travel to or from such countries or the travel industry in general and therefore have an adverse impact on our results of operations While lower occupancy rates have historically resulted in accommodation providers increasing their distribution of accommodation reservations through thirdparty intermediaries such as us our remuneration for accommodation reservation transactions changes proportionately with price and therefore lower average daily rates generally have a negative effect on our accommodation reservation business and a negative effect on our gross profit These and other macroeconomic uncertainties such as oil prices geopolitical tensions and differing central bank monetary policies have led to significant volatility in the exchange rates between the US Dollar and the Euro the British Pound Sterling and other currencies Significant fluctuations in currency exchange rates stock markets and oil prices can also impact consumer travel behavior For example although lower oil prices may lead to increased travel activity as consumers have more discretionary funds and airline fares decrease declines in oil prices may be indicative of broader macroeconomic weakness which in turn could negatively affect the travel industry and our business Since the United Kingdoms Brexit vote global markets and foreign exchange rates have experienced increased volatility including a decline in the value of the British Pound Sterling as compared to the US Dollar Upon leaving the European Union among other things the United Kingdom could lose access to the single European Union market and travel between the United Kingdom and European Union countries could be restricted We could face new regulatory costs and challenges if UK regulations and policies diverge from those of the European Union Since the timing and terms of the United Kingdoms exit from the European Union are uncertain we are unable to predict the effect Brexit will have on our business including the effect on nonUK citizens employed by us in the United Kingdom and results of operations The United Kingdoms decision to leave the European Union could result in other member countries also determining to leave which could lead to added economic and political uncertainty and devaluation or eventual abandonment of the Euro common currency any of which could have a negative impact on travel and therefore our business and results of operations The uncertainty of macroeconomic factors and their impact on consumer behavior which may differ across regions makes it more difficult to forecast industry and consumer trends and the timing and degree of their impact on our markets and business which in turn could adversely affect our ability to effectively manage our business and adversely affect our results of operations In addition unforeseen events beyond our control such as oil prices stock market volatility terrorist attacks unusual or extreme weather or natural disasters such as earthquakes hurricanes tsunamis floods droughts and volcanic eruptions 10 travelrelated health concerns including pandemics and epidemics such as Ebola Zika and MERS political instability changes in economic conditions regional hostilities imposition of taxes or surcharges by regulatory authorities changes in trade or immigration policies or travelrelated accidents can disrupt travel or otherwise result in declines in travel demand Because these events or concerns and the full impact of their effects are largely unpredictable they can dramatically and suddenly affect travel behavior by consumers and therefore demand for our services which can adversely affect our business and results of operations For example our business and operations have been negatively impacted by terrorist attacks Hurricanes Harvey and Irma which disrupted travel in the southeastern United States and parts of the Caribbean respectively in August 2017 and the coup attempt in Turkey in July 2016 Also as European countries respond to an increased flow of migrants from the Middle East travel between countries within the European Union and to and from the region could be subject to increased restrictions or the closing of borders which could negatively impact travel to from or within the European Union and adversely affect our business and results of operations Certain jurisdictions particularly in Europe are considering regulations intended to address the issue of overtourism including by restricting access to city centers or popular tourist destinations or limiting accommodation offerings in surrounding areas such as by restricting construction of new hotels or the renting of homes or apartments Such regulations could adversely affect travel to or our ability to offer accommodations in such markets which could negatively impact our business growth and results of operations The United States has implemented or proposed or is considering various travel restrictions and actions that could affect US trade policy or practices which could also adversely affect travel to or from the United States Future terrorist attacks natural disasters health concerns civil or political unrest or other events outside our control could disrupt our business and operations and adversely affect our results of operations Intense competition could reduce our market share and harm our financial performance We compete globally with both online and traditional travel and restaurant reservation and related services The markets for the services we offer are intensely competitive and current and new competitors can launch new services at a relatively low cost Some of our current and potential competitors such as Google Apple Alibaba Tencent Amazon and Facebook have access to significantly greater and more diversified resources than we do and they may be able to leverage other aspects of their businesses eg search or mobile device businesses to enable them to compete more effectively with us For example Google has entered various aspects of the online travel market including by establishing a flight metasearch product Google Flights and a hotel metasearch product Google Hotel Ads that are growing rapidly as well as its Book on Google reservation functionality and its Google Trips app We currently or may potentially in the future compete with a variety of companies including  online travel reservation services such as Expedia Hotelscom Hotwire Orbitz Travelocity Wotif Cheaptickets ebookers HotelClub RatesToGo and CarRentalscom which are owned by Expedia Hotel Reservation Service HRS and hotelde which are owned by Hotel Reservation Service and AutoEurope CarTrawler Ctrip in which we hold a minority interest eLong in which Ctrip holds a significant minority interest ezTravel in which Ctrip holds a majority interest Meituan in which we hold a small minority interest MakeMyTrip OYO Rooms Yatra Cleartrip Traveloka in which Expedia holds a minority interest Webjet Rakuten Jalan which is owned by Recruit ViajaNet Submarino Viagens DespegarDecolar in which Expedia holds a minority interest Fliggy operated by Alibaba 17ucom HotelTonight CheapOair and eDreams ODIGEO  online accommodation search andor reservation services such as Airbnb HomeAway which is owned by Expedia and Tujia in which Ctrip and Expedia hold investments currently focused primarily on alternative accommodations including individually owned properties such as homes and apartments  large online companies including search social networking and marketplace companies such as Google Facebook Alibaba Tencent Amazon and Baidu  traditional travel agencies travel management companies wholesalers and tour operators many of which combine physical locations telephone services and online services such as Carlson Wagonlit American Express BCD Travel Concur which is owned by SAP Thomas Cook TUI and Hotelbeds which acquired Tourico and GTA in 2017 as well as thousands of individual travel agencies around the world  travel service providers such as accommodation providers rental car companies and airlines many of which have their own branded websites to which they drive business including large hotel chains such as Marriott International Hilton and Hyatt Hotels as well as joint efforts by travel service providers such as Room Key an online hotel reservation service owned by several major hotel companies 11  online travel search and price comparison services generally referred to as metasearch services such as Google Flights Google Hotel Ads TripAdvisor trivago in which Expedia holds a majority interest Qunar which is controlled by Ctrip Skyscanner in which Ctrip holds a majority interest and HotelsCombined  online restaurant reservation services such as TripAdvisors LaFourchette Yelps SeatMe Zomato Bookatable which is owned by Michelin Quandoo which is owned by Recruit and Resy in which Airbnb holds a minority interest  companies offering new rental car business models or car or ridesharing services that affect demand for rental cars some of which have developed innovative technologies to improve efficiency of pointtopoint transportation and extensively utilize mobile platforms such as Uber Lyft Gett Zipcar which is owned by Avis BlaBlaCar Didi Chuxing Grab and Ola and  companies offering technology services and software solutions to accommodation providers including large global distribution systems or GDSs such as Amadeus and Sabre Google the worlds largest search engine and one of the worlds largest companies and other large established companies with substantial resources and expertise in developing online commerce and facilitating internet traffic have launched search metasearch andor reservation booking services and may create additional inroads into online travel Googles travel metasearch services Google Hotel Ads and Google Flights are growing rapidly and have achieved significant market share in a relatively short time Metasearch services leverage their search technology to aggregate travel search results for the consumers specific itinerary across travel service provider eg accommodations rental car companies or airlines online travel company OTC and other travel websites and in many instances compete directly with us for customers Metasearch services intend to appeal to consumers by showing broader travel search results than may be available through OTCs or other travel websites which could lead to travel service providers or others gaining a larger share of search traffic Google leverages its general search business to promote its metasearch offerings by showing metasearch results at the top of its organic search results Further TripAdvisor and trivago two other leading metasearch companies support their metasearch services with significant brand and performance advertising Through our KAYAK metasearch service we compete directly with other metasearch services KAYAK depends on access to information related to travel service pricing schedules availability and other related information from OTCs and travel service providers To the extent OTCs or travel service providers do not provide such information to KAYAK KAYAKs business and results of operations could be harmed Consumers may favor travel services offered by metasearch websites or search companies over OTCs which could reduce traffic to our travel reservation websites increase consumer awareness of our competitors brands and websites and increase our advertising and other customer acquisition costs To the extent any such consumer behavior leads to growth in our KAYAK metasearch business such growth may not result in sufficient increases in profits from our KAYAK metasearch business to offset any related decrease in profits experienced by our OTC brands Further metasearch services may evolve into more traditional OTCs by offering consumers the ability to make travel reservations directly through their websites For example TripAdvisor allows consumers to make a reservation at some accommodations while staying on TripAdvisor through its Instant Booking offering which includes participation by many of the leading global hotel chains We have been participating in Instant Booking since 2015 however such participation may not result in substantial incremental bookings and could cannibalize business that would otherwise come to us through other ad offerings on TripAdvisor directly including after a consumer first visits TripAdvisor or through other channels some of which may be more profitable to us than reservations generated through Instant Booking To the extent consumers book travel services through a service such as TripAdvisors Instant Booking Googles Book on Google a metasearch website or directly with a travel service provider after visiting a metasearch website or metasearch utility on a traditional search engine without using an OTC like us or if metasearch services limit our participation within their search results or evolve into more traditional OTCs we may need to increase our advertising or other customer acquisition costs to maintain or grow our reservation bookings and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected There has been a proliferation of new channels through which accommodation providers can offer reservations For example companies such as Airbnb and HomeAway which is owned by Expedia offer services providing alternative accommodation property owners particularly individuals an online place to list their accommodations where travelers can search and book such properties and compete directly with our alternative accommodation services In addition Airbnb has begun offering hotel reservations through its online and mobile platforms Further metasearch services may lower the cost for new companies to enter the market by providing a distribution channel without the cost of promoting the new entrants brand to drive consumers directly to its website If any of these services are successful in attracting consumers who would otherwise use our services our business and results of operations would be harmed 12 Although we believe that providing an extensive collection of properties excellent customer service and an intuitive easy to use website or mobile experience are important factors influencing a consumers decision to make a reservation for many consumers particularly in certain markets the price of the travel service is the primary factor determining whether a consumer will book a reservation As a result it is increasingly important to offer travel services such as hotel room rates at competitive prices whether through discounts coupons closeduser group rates or loyalty programs or otherwise Discounting and couponing coupled with a high degree of consumer shopping behavior is particularly common in Asian markets while brand loyalty in such markets can be less important In some cases our competitors are willing to make little or no profit on a transaction or offer travel services at a loss in order to gain market share If we are unable to effectively compete in these markets our market share business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected Travel service providers including hotel chains rental car companies and airlines with which we conduct business compete with us in online channels to drive consumers to their own websites in lieu of thirdparty distributors such as us Travel service providers may charge lower prices and in some instances offer advantages such as loyalty points or special discounts to members of closed user groups such as loyalty program participants or consumers with registered accounts any of which could make their offerings more attractive to consumers than our services For example many large hotel chains have instituted additional initiatives such as increased discounting and incentives to encourage consumers to book accommodations directly through their websites Discounting may increase as competition authorities seek to allow increased pricing flexibility among providers of travel service reservations We may need to offer similar advantages to maintain or grow our reservation bookings which could adversely impact our profitability Further consolidation among travel service providers such as Marriott Internationals acquisition in 2017 of Starwood Hotels  Resorts could result in lower rates of commission paid to OTCs increased discounting and greater incentives for consumers to join closed user groups as such travel service providers expand their offerings If we are not as effective as our competitors including hotel chains in offering discounted prices to closed user groups or if we are unable to entice members of our competitors closed user groups to use our services our ability to grow and compete could be harmed We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates We conduct a substantial majority of our business outside the United States but we report our results in US Dollars As a result we face exposure to movements in currency exchange rates as the financial results of our international businesses are translated from local currency principally Euros and British Pounds Sterling into US Dollars Throughout 2015 the US Dollar strengthened significantly yearoveryear relative to substantially all currencies in which we transact most notably the Euro Brazilian Real British Pound Sterling Russian Ruble and Australian Dollar In 2016 the US Dollar continued to be stronger yearoveryear relative to the British Pound Sterling Russian Ruble and many other major currencies in which we transact After the Brexit referendum in the United Kingdom in June 2016 the US Dollar strengthened significantly against the British Pound Sterling As a result of these currency exchange rate changes in 2015 and 2016 our foreigncurrencydenominated net assets gross bookings an operating and statistical metric referring to the total dollar value generally inclusive of all taxes and fees of all travel services booked by our customers net of cancellations gross profit operating expenses and net income were lower as expressed in US Dollars In 2017 the Euro British Pound Sterling and certain other currencies in which we transact strengthened against the US Dollar If the US Dollar were to again strengthen our foreigncurrencydenominated net assets gross bookings gross profit operating expenses and net income when expressed in US Dollars would decrease Recent years have seen significant volatility in the exchange rate between the Euro the British Pound Sterling the US Dollar and other currencies Significant fluctuations in currency exchange rates can affect consumer travel behavior For example the strengthening of the US Dollar relative to the Euro in 2015 made it more expensive for Europeans to travel to the United States and the dramatic depreciation of the Russian Ruble in 2014 and 2015 made it more expensive for Russians to travel to Europe and most other nonRuble destinations Consumers traveling from a country whose currency has weakened against other currencies may book lower ADR accommodations choose to shorten or cancel their international travel plans or choose to travel domestically rather than internationally any of which could adversely affect our gross bookings revenues and results of operations in particular when expressed in US Dollars Additionally foreign exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency result in gains and losses that are reflected in our financial results Volatility in foreign exchange rates and its impact on consumer behavior which may differ across regions make it more difficult to forecast industry and consumer trends and the timing and degree of their impact on our markets and business which in turn could adversely affect our ability to effectively manage our business and our results of operations 13 We face risks related to the growth rate and the global expansion of our business We derive a substantial portion of our revenues and have significant operations outside the United States Our international businesses include the Netherlandsbased accommodation reservation service Bookingcom the Asiabased accommodation reservation service agodacom the UKbased rental car reservation service Rentalcarscom which began operating as part of Bookingcom on January 1 2018 and to a lesser extent KAYAKs international metasearch services and OpenTables international restaurant reservation business Our international OTC operations have achieved significant yearoveryear growth in their gross bookings These growth rates which have contributed significantly to our growth in consolidated revenue gross profit and earnings have declined a trend we expect to continue as the absolute level of our gross bookings increases Other factors may also slow the growth rates of our international businesses including for example worldwide or regional economic conditions strengthening of the US Dollar versus the Euro the British Pound Sterling and other currencies declines in ADRs increases in cancellations adverse changes in travel market conditions and the competitiveness of the market A decline in the growth rates of our international businesses could have a negative impact on our revenue and earnings growth rates and as a consequence our stock price Our strategy involves continued expansion in regions throughout the world Many of these regions have different economic conditions customs languages currencies consumer expectations levels of consumer acceptance and use of the internet for commerce legislation regulatory environments including labor laws and customs tax laws and levels of political stability and we are subject to associated risks typical of international businesses International markets may have strong local competitors with an established brand and travel service provider or restaurant relationships that may make expansion in that market difficult and costly and take more time than anticipated In addition compliance with legal regulatory or tax requirements in multiple jurisdictions places demands on our time and resources and we may nonetheless experience unforeseen and potentially adverse legal regulatory or tax consequences In some markets such as China legal and other regulatory requirements may prohibit or limit participation by foreign businesses such as by making foreign ownership or management of internet or travelrelated businesses illegal or difficult or may make direct participation in those markets uneconomic which could make our entry into and expansion in those markets difficult or impossible require that we work with a local partner or result in higher operating costs If we are unsuccessful in rapidly expanding in new and existing markets and effectively managing that expansion our business and results of operations could be adversely affected Certain markets in which we operate that are in earlier stages of development have lower operating margins compared to more mature markets which could have a negative impact on our overall margins as these markets increase in size over time Also we intend to continue to invest in adding accommodations available for reservation on our websites such as hotels motels resorts homes apartments and other unique places to stay Many of the newer accommodations we add to our travel reservation services especially in highlypenetrated markets may have fewer rooms or higher credit risk and may appeal to a smaller subset of consumers eg hostels and bed and breakfasts Because alternative accommodations are often either a single unit or a small collection of independent units these properties generally represent more limited booking opportunities than hotels motels and resorts which generally have more units to rent per property Further alternative accommodations in general may be subject to increased seasonality due to local tourism seasons weather or other factors or may not be available at peak times due to use by the property owners and we may also experience lower profit margins with respect to these properties due to certain additional costs related to offering these accommodations on our websites As we increase our alternative accommodation business these different characteristics could negatively impact our profit margins and to the extent these properties represent an increasing percentage of the properties added to our websites we expect that our gross bookings growth rate and property growth rate will continue to diverge over time since each such property has fewer booking opportunities As a result of the foregoing as the percentage of alternative accommodation properties increases the number of reservations per property will likely continue to decrease In addition as our alternative accommodation reservation business grows we may incur increasing numbers of complaints related to nonexistent properties or properties that are significantly different than as described in the listing as well as claims of liability based on events occurring at such properties such as robbery injury death and other similar events Such complaints or claims could result in negative publicity and increased costs which could adversely affect our reputation business and results of operations Further the regulatory environment related to some alternative accommodations such as homes and apartments is evolving and laws regulations or property association rules could impose restrictions or burdens on these property owners that limit or negatively affect their ability to rent their properties Some jurisdictions have adopted or are considering statutes or ordinances that prohibit owners and managers from renting certain properties for fewer than a stated number of consecutive days or for more than an aggregate total number of days per year In addition several jurisdictions have adopted or are considering adopting statutes or ordinances requiring online platforms that list certain alternative accommodations to obtain a license to list such accommodations andor to comply with other restrictions or requirements Such regulations could negatively impact the growth andor size of our alternative accommodation reservation business 14 We believe that the increase in the number of accommodation providers that participate on our websites and the corresponding access to accommodation room nights has been a key driver of the growth of our accommodation reservation business The growth in our accommodation bookings typically makes us an attractive source of consumer demand for our accommodation providers However accommodation providers may wish to limit the amount of business that flows through a single distribution channel Also certain jurisdictions particularly in Europe are considering regulations intended to address the issue of overtourism including by restricting accommodation offerings in city centers or near popular tourist destinations such as by restricting construction of new hotels or the renting of homes or apartments Such restrictions could also include limiting the number of tourists permitted to visit and stay near popular areas during peak seasons or as a general matter As a result we may experience constraints on the number of listings or accommodation room nights actually available to us which could negatively impact our growth rate and results of operations The number of our employees worldwide has grown from approximately 6900 as of December 31 2012 to approximately 22900 as of December 31 2017  which growth is mostly comprised of hires by our international operations We may not be able to hire train retain motivate and manage required personnel which may limit our growth damage our reputation negatively affect our financial performance and otherwise harm our business In addition expansion increases the complexity of our business and places additional strain on our management operations technical performance financial resources and internal financial control and reporting functions Our current and planned personnel systems procedures and controls may not be adequate to support and effectively manage this growth and our future operations especially as we employ personnel in multiple geographic locations around the world We rely on performance and brand advertising channels to generate a significant amount of traffic to our websites and grow our business We believe that maintaining and strengthening our brands are important aspects of our efforts to attract and retain customers We have invested considerable money and resources in the establishment and maintenance of our brands and we will continue to invest resources in brand advertising marketing and other brand building efforts to preserve and enhance consumer awareness of our brands In addition effective performance advertising has been an important factor in our growth and we believe it will continue to be important to our future success As our competitors spend increasingly more on advertising we are required to spend more in order to maintain our brand recognition and in the case of performance advertising to maintain and grow traffic to our websites through performance advertising channels We may not be able to successfully maintain or enhance consumer awareness and acceptance of our brands and even if we are successful in our branding efforts such efforts may not be costeffective For instance we have observed increased brand advertising by OTCs metasearch services and travel service providers particularly in North America and Europe which may make our brand advertising efforts more expensive and less effective If we are unable to maintain or enhance consumer awareness and acceptance of our brands in a costeffective manner our business market share and results of operations would be materially adversely affected Our online performance advertising efficiency expressed as performance advertising expense as a percentage of gross profit is impacted by a number of factors that are subject to variability and that are in some cases outside of our control including ADRs costs per click cancellation rates foreign exchange rates our ability to convert paid traffic to booking customers and the extent to which consumers come directly to our websites or mobile apps for bookings For example competition for desired rankings in search results andor a decline in ad clicks by consumers could increase our costsperclick and reduce our performance advertising efficiency We use thirdparty websites including online search engines primarily Google metasearch and travel research services and affiliate marketing as primary means of generating traffic to our websites Our performance advertising expense has increased significantly and our performance advertising efficiency has declined in recent years a trend we expect to continue though the rate of decrease may fluctuate and there may be periods of stable or increasing ROIs from time to time Further at times we may pursue a strategy of increasing performance advertising ROIs which could negatively affect our gross bookings and gross profit growth rates Any reduction in our performance advertising efficiency could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations whether through reduced revenues or revenue growth or through advertising expenses increasing faster than revenues and thereby reducing margins and earnings growth We believe that a number of factors could cause consumers to increase their shopping activity before making a travel purchase Increased shopping activity reduces our performance advertising efficiency and effectiveness because traffic becomes less likely to result in a reservation through our website and such traffic is more likely to be obtained through paid performance advertising channels than through direct channels Further consumers may favor travel services offered by search or metasearch companies over OTCs which could reduce traffic to our travel reservation websites increase consumer awareness of our competitors brands and websites increase our advertising and other customer acquisition costs and adversely affect our business margins and results of operations To the extent any such increased shopping behavior leads to growth in 15 our KAYAK metasearch business such growth may not result in sufficient increases in gross profit from our KAYAK metasearch business to offset any related decrease in gross profit or increase in advertising and other customer acquisition costs experienced by our OTC brands Our business could be negatively affected by changes in internet search and metasearch algorithms and dynamics or trafficgenerating arrangements We use Google to generate a significant portion of the traffic to our websites and to a lesser extent we use other search and metasearch websites to generate traffic to our websites principally through payperclick advertising campaigns The pricing and operating dynamics on these search and metasearch websites can experience rapid change commercially technically and competitively For example Google frequently updates and changes the logic which determines the placement and display of results of a consumers search such that the placement of links to our websites can be negatively affected and our costs to improve or maintain our placement in search results can increase In June 2017 the European Commission fined Google 24 billion Euros for breaching European Union antitrust rules by giving its comparison shopping service priority placement in Google search results Google has appealed the European Commissions decision and it is not yet clear how or whether the decision will affect Googles ranking of its travel metasearch services Google Flights and Google Hotel Ads in Google search results Changes by Google in how it presents travel search results including its promotion of its travel metasearch services or the manner in which it conducts the auction for placement among search results may be competitively disadvantageous to us and may impact our ability to efficiently generate traffic to our websites which in turn would have an adverse effect on our business market share and results of operations Similarly changes by our other search and metasearch partners in how they present travel search results or the manner in which they conduct the auction for placement among search results may be competitively disadvantageous to us and may impact our ability to efficiently generate traffic to our websites In addition we purchase website traffic from a number of other sources including some operated by our competitors in the form of payperclick arrangements that can be terminated with little or no notice If one or more of such arrangements is terminated our business market share and results of operations could be adversely affected We rely on various thirdparty distribution channels ie marketing affiliates to distribute accommodation rental car and airline ticket reservations Should one or more of such third parties cease distribution of reservations made through us or suffer deterioration in its search or metasearch ranking due to changes in search or metasearch algorithms or otherwise our business market share and results of operations could be negatively affected We may not be able to keep up with rapid technological changes The markets in which we compete are characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards consolidation frequent new service announcements introductions and enhancements and changing consumer demands We may not be able to keep up with these rapid changes In addition these market characteristics are heightened by the progress of technology adoption in various markets including the continuing adoption of the internet and online commerce in certain geographies and the emergence and growth of the use of smartphones and tablets for mobile ecommerce transactions including through the increasing use of mobile apps New developments in other areas such as cloud computing could make entering our markets easier for competitors due to lower upfront technology costs As a result our future success will depend on our ability to adapt to rapidly changing technologies to adapt our services and online platforms to evolving industry standards and to continually innovate and improve the performance features and reliability of our services and online platforms in response to competitive service offerings and the evolving demands of the marketplace In particular it is increasingly important for us to effectively offer our services on mobile devices through mobile apps and mobileoptimized websites Any failure by us to successfully develop and achieve customer adoption of our mobile apps and mobileoptimized websites would have a material and adverse effect on our growth market share business and results of operations Further to the extent mobile devices enable users to block advertising content on their devices our advertising revenue and our ability to market our brands and acquire new customers may be negatively affected We believe that easeofuse comprehensive functionality and the look and feel of our mobile apps and mobileoptimized websites are increasingly competitively critical as consumers obtain more of their travel and restaurant services through mobile devices As a result we intend to continue to spend significant resources maintaining developing and enhancing our websites and mobile platforms including our mobileoptimized websites and mobile apps and other technologies and platforms Further technical innovation often results in bugs and other system failures Any such bug or failure especially in connection with a significant technical implementation or change could result in lost business harm to our brand or reputation customer complaints and other adverse consequences any of which could adversely affect our business and results of operations Furthermore as the overall size of our business has grown the competitive pressure to innovate will encompass a wider range of services and technologies including services and technologies that may be outside of our historical core business and our ability to keep pace may slow Our current and potential competitors range from large and established 16 companies to emerging startups Emerging startups may be able to innovate and focus on developing a particularly new product or service faster than we can or may foresee consumer need for new services or technologies before us Some of our larger competitors or potential competitors have more resources or more established relationships with consumers than we do and they could use these advantages in ways that could affect our competitive position including by making acquisitions entering or investing in travel reservation businesses investing in research and development and competing aggressively for highlyskilled employees In addition the widespread adoption of new internet networking or telecommunications technologies or other technological changes including new devices and services such as Amazons Echo and Alexa and Google Home and developing technologies such as artificial intelligence chatbot and virtual reality technologies could require us to incur substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our services or infrastructure to those new technologies which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition Any failure to implement or adapt to new technologies in a timely manner or at all could adversely affect our ability to compete increase our customer acquisition costs or otherwise adversely affect our business and therefore adversely affect our brand market share and results of operations Our processing storage use and disclosure of personal data exposes us to risks of internal or external security breaches and could give rise to liabilities The security of data when engaging in electronic commerce is essential to maintaining consumer and travel service provider confidence in our services Any security breach whether instigated internally or externally on our systems or other internetbased systems could significantly harm our reputation and therefore our business brand market share and results of operations We currently require consumers who use certain of our services to guarantee their offers with their credit card We require user names and passwords in order to access our information technology systems We also use encryption and authentication technologies to secure the transmission and storage of data and prevent unauthorized access to our data or accounts It is possible that computer circumvention capabilities new discoveries or advances or other developments including our own acts or omissions could result in a compromise or breach of consumer data For example third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees travel service provider partners or customers to disclose user names passwords or other sensitive information phishing which may in turn be used to access our information technology systems or to defraud our partners or customers We have experienced targeted and organized phishing attacks and may experience more in the future These risks are likely to increase as we expand our offerings integrate our products and services and store and process more data including personal information Our efforts to protect information from unauthorized access may be unsuccessful or may result in the rejection of legitimate attempts to book reservations through our services any of which could result in lost business and materially adversely affect our business reputation and results of operations Our existing security measures may not be successful in preventing security breaches A party whether internal external an affiliate or unrelated third party that is able to circumvent our security systems could steal consumer information or transaction data or other proprietary information In the last few years several major companies experienced highprofile security breaches that exposed their systems and information andor their customers or employees personal information We expend significant resources to protect against security breaches and we may need to increase our securityrelated expenditures to maintain or increase our systems security or to address problems caused and liabilities incurred by breaches These issues are likely to become more difficult to manage as we expand the number of places where we operate and the number and variety of services we offer and as the tools and techniques used in such attacks become more advanced Security breaches could result in severe damage to our information technology infrastructure including damage that could impair our ability to offer our services or the ability of consumers to make reservations or conduct searches through our services as well as loss of customer financial or other data that could materially and adversely affect our ability to conduct our business satisfy our commercial obligations or meet our public reporting requirements in a timely fashion or at all Security breaches could also result in negative publicity damage our reputation expose us to risk of loss or litigation and possible liability subject us to regulatory penalties and sanctions or cause consumers to lose confidence in our security and choose to use the services of our competitors any of which would have a negative effect on our brands market share results of operations and financial condition Our insurance policies carry low coverage limits and would likely not be adequate to reimburse us for all losses caused by security breaches We also face risks associated with security breaches affecting third parties conducting business over the internet Consumers generally are concerned with security and privacy on the internet and any publicized security problems could negatively affect consumers willingness to provide private information or effect commercial transactions on the internet generally including through our services Some of our business is conducted with thirdparty marketing affiliates which may generate travel reservations through our infrastructure or through other systems Additionally consumers using our services could be affected by security breaches at third parties such as travel service providers payroll providers health plan providers payment processors or GDSs upon which we rely A security breach at any such thirdparty marketing affiliate travel service 17 provider payment processor GDS or other third party on which we rely such as the security breach experienced by Sabre in May 2017 could be perceived by consumers as a security breach of our systems and in any event could result in negative publicity subject us to notification requirements damage our reputation expose us to risk of loss or litigation and possible liability and subject us to regulatory penalties and sanctions In addition such third parties may not comply with applicable disclosure requirements which could expose us to liability In our processing of travel transactions we receive and store a large volume of personally identifiable data This data is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world such as the European Unions Data Protection Directive and variations and implementations of that directive in the member states of the European Union In addition in April 2016 the European Union adopted a new General Data Protection Regulation designed to unify data protection within the European Union under a single law which has resulted and will result in significantly greater compliance burdens and costs for companies with users and operations in the European Union Under the General Data Protection Regulation fines of up to 20 million Euros or up to 4 of the annual global revenues of the infringer whichever is greater could be imposed This government action is typically intended to protect the privacy of personal data that is collected processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction In many cases these laws apply not only to thirdparty transactions but also to transfers of information between us and our subsidiaries including employee information The General Data Protection Regulation will go into effect and apply to us beginning in May 2018 In the United Kingdom a Data Protection Bill has been introduced in Parliament that if adopted would substantially implement the European Unions General Data Protection Regulation in the United Kingdom In February 2016 EU and US authorities announced that they had reached agreement on a new data transfer framework called the EUUS Privacy Shield which was formally adopted by the European Commission on July 12 2016 The European Union and the United States are implementing the new framework but it is currently subject to legal challenge These laws and their interpretations continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction Noncompliance with these laws could result in penalties or significant legal liability We could be adversely affected if legislation or regulations are expanded to require changes in our business practices or if governing jurisdictions interpret or implement their legislation or regulations in ways that negatively affect our business results of operations or financial condition We are also subject to payment card association rules and obligations under our contracts with payment card processors Under these rules and obligations if information is compromised we could be liable to payment card issuers for associated expenses and penalties In addition if we fail to follow payment card industry security standards even if no customer information is compromised we could incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs System capacity constraints system failures or denialofservice or other attacks could harm our business We have experienced rapid growth in consumer traffic to our websites and through our mobile apps the number of accommodations on our extranets and the geographic breadth of our operations If our systems cannot be expanded to cope with increased demand or fail to perform we could experience unanticipated disruptions in service slower response times decreased customer service and customer satisfaction and delays in the introduction of new services any of which could impair our reputation damage our brands and materially and adversely affect our results of operations Further as an online business we are dependent on the internet and maintaining connectivity between ourselves and consumers sources of internet traffic such as Google and our travel service providers and restaurants As consumers increasingly turn to mobile devices we also become dependent on consumers access to the internet through mobile carriers and their systems Disruptions in internet access such as the denial of service attack against Dyn in October 2016 that resulted in a service outage for a number of major internet companies whether generally in a specific market or otherwise especially if widespread or prolonged could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations While we do maintain redundant systems and hosting services it is possible that we could experience an interruption in our business and we do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for all losses that may occur Our computer hardware for operating our services is currently located at hosting facilities around the world These systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from human error floods fires power loss telecommunication failures and similar events They are also subject to breakins sabotage intentional acts of vandalism terrorism and similar misconduct Despite any precautions we may take the occurrence of any disruption of service due to any such misconduct natural disaster or other unanticipated problems at such facilities or the failure by such facilities to provide our required data communications capacity could result in lengthy interruptions or delays in our services Any system failure that causes an interruption or delay in service could impair our reputation damage our brands result in lost business or result in consumers choosing to use a competitive service any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 18 Our existing security measures may not be successful in preventing attacks on our systems and any such attack could cause significant interruptions in our operations For instance from time to time we have experienced denialofservice type attacks on our systems that have made portions of our websites slow or unavailable for periods of time There are numerous other potential forms of attack such as phishing where a third party attempts to infiltrate our systems or acquire information by posing as a legitimate inquiry or electronic communication SQL injection where a third party attempts to insert malicious code into our software through data entry fields in our websites in order to gain control of the system and attempting to use our websites as a platform to launch a denialofservice attack on another party each of which could cause significant interruptions in our operations and potentially adversely affect the value of our brands operations and results of operations or involve us in legal or regulatory proceedings We expend significant resources in an attempt to prepare for and mitigate the effects of any such attacks Reductions in website availability and response time could cause loss of substantial business volumes during the occurrence of any such attack on our systems and measures we may take to divert suspect traffic in the event of such an attack could result in the diversion of bona fide customers These issues are likely to become more difficult to manage as we expand the number of places where we operate and the variety of services we offer and as the tools and techniques used in such attacks become more advanced Successful attacks could result in negative publicity damage our reputation and prevent consumers from booking travel services researching travel services or making restaurant reservations through us during the attack any of which could cause consumers to use the services of our competitors which would have a negative effect on the value of our brands our market share business and results of operations We rely on certain thirdparty computer systems and thirdparty service providers including GDSs and computerized central reservation systems of the accommodation rental car and airline industries in connection with providing some of our services Any interruption in these thirdparty services and systems or deterioration in their performance could prevent us from booking related accommodation rental car and airline reservations and have a material adverse effect on our business brands and results of operations Our agreements with some thirdparty service providers are terminable upon short notice and often do not provide recourse for service interruptions In the event our arrangement with any such third party is terminated we may not be able to find an alternative source of systems support on a timely basis or on commercially reasonable terms and as a result it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations We depend upon various third parties to process payments including credit cards for our merchant transactions around the world In addition we rely on third parties to provide credit card numbers which we use as a payment mechanism for merchant transactions If any such third party were wholly or partially compromised our cash flows could be disrupted or we may not be able to generate merchant transactions and related revenues until such a time as a replacement process could be put in place with a different vendor We do not have a completely formalized or comprehensive disaster recovery plan in every geographic region in which we conduct business In the event of certain system failures we may not be able to switch to backup systems immediately and the time to full recovery could be prolonged Like many online businesses we have experienced system failures from time to time In addition to placing increased burdens on our engineering staff these outages create a significant amount of consumer questions and complaints that need to be addressed by our customer support personnel Any unscheduled interruption in our service could result in an immediate loss of revenues that could be substantial increase customer service costs harm our reputation and result in some consumers switching to our competitors If we experience frequent or persistent system failures our reputation and brand could be permanently and significantly harmed We have taken and continue to take steps to increase the reliability and redundancy of our systems These steps are expensive may reduce our margins and may not be successful in reducing the frequency or duration of unscheduled downtime We use both internally developed systems and thirdparty systems to operate our services including transaction processing order management and financial systems If the number of consumers using our services increases substantially or if critical thirdparty systems stop operating as designed we will need to significantly expand and upgrade our technology transaction processing systems financial and accounting systems and other infrastructure We may not be able to upgrade our systems and infrastructure to accommodate such conditions in a timely manner and depending on the thirdparty systems affected our transactional financial and accounting systems could be impacted for a meaningful amount of time before upgrade expansion or repair Consumer adoption and use of mobile devices creates challenges and may enable device companies such as Apple to compete directly with us Widespread adoption of mobile devices such as the iPhone Androidenabled smartphones and tablets such as the iPad coupled with the web browsing functionality and development of thousands of useful apps available on these devices is driving substantial online traffic and commerce to mobile platforms We have experienced a significant shift of business both direct and indirect to mobile platforms and our advertising partners are also seeing a rapid shift of traffic to mobile platforms Some competitors offer lastminute discounts for mobile accommodation reservations Advertising and distribution 19 opportunities may be more limited on mobile devices given their smaller screen sizes The gross profit earned on a mobile transaction may be less than a typical desktop transaction due to different consumer purchasing patterns For example accommodation reservations made on a mobile device typically are for shorter lengths of stay and are not made as far in advance Further given the device sizes and technical limitations of tablets and smartphones mobile consumers may not be willing to download multiple apps from multiple companies providing a similar service and instead prefer to use one or a limited number of apps for their mobile travel and restaurant research and reservation activity As a result the consumer experience with mobile apps as well as brand recognition and loyalty are likely to become increasingly important Our mobile offerings have received generally strong reviews and are driving a material and increasing share of our business We believe that mobile bookings present an opportunity for growth and are necessary to maintain and grow our business as consumers increasingly turn to mobile devices instead of a personal computer As a result it is increasingly important for us to develop and maintain effective mobile apps and websites optimized for mobile devices to provide consumers with an appealing easytouse mobile experience If we are unable to continue to rapidly innovate and create new userfriendly and differentiated mobile offerings and efficiently and effectively advertise and distribute on these platforms or if our mobile offerings are not used by consumers we could lose market share to existing competitors or new entrants and our business future growth and results of operations could be adversely affected Googles Android operating system is the leading smartphone operating system in the world As a result Google could leverage its Android operating system to give its travel services a competitive advantage either technically or with prominence on its Google Play app store or within its mobile search results Further Google is the leading internet search service and has leveraged its search popularity to promote its travel metasearch services Similarly Apple the producer of among other things the iPhone and iPad obtained a patent for iTravel a mobile app that would allow a traveler to check in for a travel reservation In addition Apples iPhone operating system includes Wallet a virtual wallet app that holds tickets boarding passes coupons and gift cards and along with iTravel may be indicative of Apples intent to enter the travel reservations business in some capacity Apple has substantial market share in the smartphone category and controls integration of offerings including travel services into its mobile operating system Apple also has more experience producing and developing mobile apps and has access to greater resources than we have Apple may use or expand iTravel Wallet Siri Apples voice recognition concierge service Apple Pay Apples mobile payment system or another mobile app or functionality as a means of entering the travel reservations marketplace To the extent Google or Apple use their mobile operating systems app distribution channels or in the case of Google search services to favor their own travel service offerings our business and results of operations could be harmed We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities As an international business providing reservation and advertising services around the world we are subject to income taxes and nonincomebased taxes in the United States and various international jurisdictions Due to economic and political conditions tax rates and tax regimes in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change Our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws or their interpretation If our effective tax rates were to increase our results of operations and cash flows would be adversely affected Although we believe that our tax filing positions are reasonable and comply with applicable law the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes may be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals To date we have been audited in many taxing jurisdictions with no significant impact on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows If future audits find that additional taxes are due we may be subject to incremental tax liabilities possibly including interest and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows For example French tax authorities conducted an audit that started in 2013 of the tax years 2003 through 2012 The French tax authorities are asserting that Bookingcom has a permanent establishment in France and are seeking to recover what they claim are unpaid income taxes and valueadded taxes In December 2015 the French tax authorities issued assessments related to these tax years for approximately 356 million Euros the majority of which represents penalties and interest We believe that Bookingcom has been and continues to be in compliance with French tax law and we are contesting the assessments Our objection to the assessments was denied by the French tax authorities If we are unable to resolve the matter with the French tax authorities we expect to challenge the assessments in the French courts In order to challenge the assessments in court we may be required to pay upfront the full amount or a significant part of any such assessments though such payment would not constitute an admission by us that we owe the taxes Alternatively any resolution or settlement of the matter with the French tax authorities may also require payment as part of such resolution or settlement French tax authorities have begun a similar audit of the tax years 2013 through 2015 which could result in additional assessments 20 In general governments are increasingly focused on ways to increase tax revenues which has contributed to an increase in audit activity and harsher stances taken by tax authorities Any such additional taxes or other assessments may be in excess of our current tax provisions or may require us to modify our business practices in order to reduce our exposure to additional taxes going forward any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition In December 2017 the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act the Tax Act was enacted into law in the United States The Tax Act made significant changes to US federal tax law including a reduction in the US federal statutory tax rate from 35 to 21 effective January 1 2018 and exempts from US federal income tax international profits distributed to the United States The Tax Act imposes a onetime mandatory deemed repatriation tax on unremitted accumulated international earnings to be paid over eight years The Companys international cash and investments as of December 31 2017 amounting to 162 billion as well as future cash generated by our international operations can be repatriated to the US without further US federal income tax See Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding our estimation of future tax liabilities The Tax Act also includes provisions effective after December 31 2017 allowing the immediate write off of the cost of certain investments in depreciable assets imposing a limit on the deduction for net interest expense changing the deductibility of covered officer compensation and changing the rules on the use of net operating losses The Tax Act also introduces a tax on 50 of global intangible lowtaxed income which is income determined to be in excess of a specified routine rate of return The Tax Act further introduces a base erosion and antiabuse tax aimed at preventing the erosion of the US tax base and a new tax on foreignderived intangible income The tax law changes made by the Tax Act are broad and complex and there are significant uncertainties about how the Tax Act will be interpreted at both the US federal and state levels and limited guidance is available from tax authorities at this time The interpretation and implementation of the Tax Act and regulations rules or guidance that may be adopted under or resulting from the Tax Act could materially change the provisional tax that we recognized in 2017 and the expected future impact of the Tax Act on our business Additionally in October 2015 the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD issued final reports in connection with its base erosion and profit shifting BEPS project The OECD with the support of the G20 initiated this project in 2013 in response to concerns that international tax standards have not kept pace with changes in global business practices and that changes are needed to international tax laws to address situations where multinational businesses may pay little or no tax in certain jurisdictions by shifting profits away from jurisdictions where the activities creating those profits take place The final reports were endorsed by the G20 leaders in November 2015 The final reports propose 15 actions the OECD determined are needed to address base erosion and profit shifting including a enhancing transparency through the sharing of tax information between countries b prescribing standardized countrybycountry reporting and other documentation requirements aimed at identifying where profits tax and economic activities occur c preventing harmful tax practices including the use of preferential tax regimes d modernizing the OECDs transfer pricing rules related to intangibles e changing the definition of permanent establishment to prevent artificial avoidance of tax nexus and f limiting tax base erosion through interest deductions and other financial payments The measures have among other things resulted in the development of a multilateral instrument MLI to incorporate and facilitate changes to tax treaties In June 2017 a number of countries signed the MLI On January 28 2016 the European Commission unveiled a new package of proposals aimed at providing a framework for fairer taxation and to provide a coordinated European Union response to combating corporate tax avoidance Following agreement among the European Union member states on the final content of the package the European Council formally adopted an AntiTax Avoidance Directive in July 2016 which was further amended in February 2017 The Directive is aimed at preventing aggressive tax planning increasing tax transparency and creating a fairer tax environment for all businesses in the European Union Further the OECDs task force on the digital economy is also working on an interim report for the G20 due in early 2018 and is considering potential ideas to address the tax challenges of the digital economy including interim solutions such as an alternative levy on electronic sales Several EU Member states have recently also proposed the concept of an equalization tax to the EU Commission that would seek to tax the turnover of digital companies In a press release dated October 19 2017 the European Council concluded that the European Union needs an effective and fair taxation system for the digital era to ensure a global level playing field in line with the work being carried out at the OECD and that it is also anticipating EU Commission proposals on this subject early in 2018 We expect many countries to change their tax laws in response to these developments and several countries have already changed or proposed changes to their tax laws in response to the final BEPS reports andor the developments in the European Union Any changes to international tax laws including new definitions of permanent establishment or changes affecting the benefits of preferential tax regimes such as the Dutch Innovation Box Tax discussed below could impact the tax treatment of our foreign earnings and adversely impact our effective tax rate Further changes to tax laws and additional reporting requirements could increase the complexity burden and cost of compliance Due to the large and expanding scale of our international business activities any changes in US or 21 international taxation of our activities or the combined effect of tax laws in multiple jurisdictions including the United States may increase our worldwide effective tax rate increase the complexity and costs associated with tax compliance especially if changes are implemented or interpreted inconsistently across tax jurisdictions and adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations We are also subject to nonincomebased taxes such as valueadded payroll sales use net worth property and goods and services taxes in the United States and various international jurisdictions as well as the potential for travel transaction taxes in the United States as discussed below and in Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements From time to time we are under audit by tax authorities with respect to these nonincomebased taxes and may have exposure to additional nonincomebased tax liabilities We may not be able to maintain our Innovation Box Tax benefit The Netherlands corporate income tax law provides that income generated from qualifying innovative activities prior to 2018 is taxed at the rate of 5 Innovation Box Tax rather than the Dutch statutory rate of 25 A portion of Bookingcoms earnings currently qualifies for Innovation Box Tax treatment In the year ended December 31 2017 the Innovation Box Tax benefit reduced our consolidated income tax expense by approximately 397 million  In order to be eligible for Innovation Box Tax treatment Bookingcom must among other things apply for and obtain an RD certificate from a Dutch governmental agency every six months confirming that the activities that Bookingcom intends to be engaged in over the subsequent sixmonth period are innovative The RD certificate is current but should Bookingcom fail to secure such a certificate in any future period  for example because the governmental agency does not view Bookingcoms new or anticipated activities as innovative  or should this agency determine that the activities contemplated to be performed in a prior period were not performed as contemplated or did not comply with the agencys requirements Bookingcom may lose its certificate and as a result the Innovation Box Tax benefit may be reduced or eliminated Bookingcom intends to apply for continued Innovation Box Tax treatment for future periods However Bookingcoms application may not be accepted or if accepted the amount of qualifying earnings may be reduced Furthermore the Dutch government introduced changes to its income tax laws that increased the Innovation Box Tax rate to 7 beginning in 2018 The Dutch government has also proposed commencing in 2019 incrementally reducing over time the corporate income tax statutory rate from 25 to 21 by 2021 If this proposal is enacted into law we expect the combined effect of these two changes to slightly increase our effective tax rate during the first two years of the income tax transition period and slightly reduce it thereafter The loss of the Innovation Box Tax benefit or any material portion thereof whether due to a change in tax law or a determination by the Dutch government that Bookingcoms activities are not innovative or for any other reason would substantially increase our effective tax rate and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows Adverse application of US state and local tax laws could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations A number of jurisdictions in the United States have initiated lawsuits against online travel companies including us related to among other things the payment of travel transaction taxes eg hotel occupancy taxes excise taxes sales taxes etc In addition a number of US states counties and municipalities have initiated audit proceedings issued proposed tax assessments or started inquiries relating to the payment of travel transaction taxes Additional state and local jurisdictions may assert that we are subject to among other things travel transaction taxes and could seek to collect such taxes either retroactively or prospectively or both In many of the judicial and other proceedings initiated to date the taxing jurisdictions seek not only historical taxes that are claimed to be owed on our gross profit but also among other things interest penalties punitive damages andor attorneys fees and costs To date many of the taxing jurisdictions in which we facilitate travel reservations have not asserted that taxes are due and payable on our travel services With respect to taxing jurisdictions that have not initiated proceedings to date it is possible that they will do so in the future or that they will seek to amend their tax statutes and seek to collect taxes from us only on a prospective basis In connection with some travel transaction tax audits and assessments we may be required to pay any assessed taxes which amounts may be substantial prior to being allowed to contest the assessments and the applicability of the laws in judicial proceedings Payment of these amounts if any is not an admission that we are subject to such taxes and even if we make such payments we intend to continue to assert our position that we should not be subject to such taxes 22 Litigation is subject to uncertainty and there could be adverse developments in these pending or future cases and proceedings Adverse tax decisions could have a material adverse effect on our business margins cash flows and results of operations An unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending litigation may encourage the commencement of additional litigation audit proceedings or other regulatory inquiries In addition an unfavorable outcome or settlement of these actions or proceedings could result in substantial liabilities for past andor future bookings including among other things interest penalties punitive damages andor attorneys fees and costs We are dependent on providers of accommodations rental cars and airline tickets and on restaurants We rely on providers of accommodations rental cars and airline tickets and on restaurants to make their services available to consumers through us Our arrangements with travel service providers generally do not require them to make available any specific quantity of accommodation reservations rental cars or airline tickets or to make accommodation reservations rental cars or airline tickets available in any geographic area for any particular route or at any particular price Similarly our arrangements with restaurants generally do not require them to provide all of their available tables and reservations to customers through us We are in regular dialogue with our major travel service providers about the nature and extent of their participation in our services A significant reduction on the part of any of our major travel service providers or providers that are particularly popular with consumers in their participation in our services for a sustained period of time or their complete withdrawal could have a material adverse effect on our business market share and results of operations To the extent any of those major or popular travel service providers ceased to participate in our services in favor of one of our competitors systems or decided to require consumers to purchase services directly from them our business market share and results of operations could be harmed During periods of higher occupancy rates accommodation providers may decrease their distribution of accommodation reservations through thirdparty intermediaries like us in particular through our discount services such as pricelinecoms Express Deals  and Name Your Own Price  services Further as consolidation among travel service providers increases the potential adverse effect of a decision by any particular significant travel service provider such as a large hotel chain airline or rental car company to withdraw from or reduce its participation in our services also increases To the extent restaurants limit the availability of reservations through OpenTable consumers may not continue to use our services andor our revenues could be adversely affected especially if reservations during highly desirable times on high volume days are not made available through us KAYAK a metasearch service depends on access to information related to travel service pricing schedules availability and other related information from OTCs and travel service providers to attract consumers To obtain this information KAYAK maintains relationships with travel service providers and OTCs Many of KAYAKs agreements with travel service providers and OTCs are shortterm agreements that may be terminated on 30 days notice To the extent OTCs or travel service providers no longer provide such information to KAYAK KAYAKs ability to provide comprehensive travel service information to consumers could be diminished and its brand business and results of operations could be harmed To the extent consumers do not view KAYAK as a reliable source of comprehensive travel service information fewer consumers would likely visit its websites which would also likely have a negative impact on KAYAKs advertising revenue and results of operations In addition if travel service providers or OTCs choose not to advertise with KAYAK or choose to reduce or eliminate the fees paid to KAYAK for referrals from query results KAYAKs business and results of operations could be adversely affected We rely on the performance of highly skilled personnel and if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel or hire retain and motivate qualified personnel our business would be harmed Our performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals Our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify hire develop motivate and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization In particular the contributions of key senior management in the United States Europe and Asia are critical to the overall management of our business We may not be able to retain the services of any members of our senior management or other key employees the loss of whom could harm our business and competitive position In addition competition for wellqualified employees in all aspects of our business including software engineers mobile communication talent and other technology professionals is intense both in the United States and abroad Our international success in particular has led to increased efforts by our competitors and others to hire our international employees These difficulties may be amplified by evolving restrictions on immigration travel or availability of visas or work permits for skilled technology workers Our continued ability to compete effectively and to innovate and develop products services technologies and enhancements depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate existing employees If we do not succeed in attracting wellqualified employees or retaining and motivating existing employees our business competitive position and results of operations would be adversely affected We do not maintain any key person life insurance policies 23 As the size of our business grows we may become increasingly subject to the scrutiny of antitrust competition and consumer protection regulators The online travel industry has become the subject of investigations by various national competition authorities NCAs particularly in Europe We are or have been involved in investigations predominantly related to whether Bookingcoms contractual parity arrangements with accommodation providers sometimes also referred to as most favored nation or MFN provisions are anticompetitive because they require accommodation providers to provide Bookingcom with room rates that are at least as low as those offered to other OTCs or through the accommodation providers website Some investigations relate to other issues such as reservation and cancellation clauses commission payments and pricing behavior For instance on September 8 2017 the Swiss Price Surveillance Office opened an investigation into the level of commissions of Bookingcom in Switzerland Investigations into Bookingcoms parity provisions were initiated in 2013 and 2014 by NCAs in France Germany Italy Austria Sweden Ireland and Switzerland A number of other NCAs have also looked at these issues On April 21 2015 the French Italian and Swedish NCAs working in close cooperation with the European Commission announced that they had accepted commitments offered by Bookingcom to resolve and close the investigations in France Italy and Sweden Under the commitments Bookingcom replaced its existing price parity agreements with accommodation providers with narrow price parity agreements Under a narrow price parity agreement subject to certain exceptions an accommodation provider is still required to offer the same or better rates on Bookingcom as it offers to a consumer directly online but it is no longer required to offer the same or better rates on Bookingcom as it offers to other OTCs The commitments also allow an accommodation provider to among other things offer different terms and conditions eg free WiFi and availability to consumers that book with online travel companies that offer lower rates of commission or other benefits offer lower rates to consumers that book through offline channels and continue to discount through among other things accommodation loyalty programs as long as those rates are not published or marketed online The commitments apply to accommodations in France Italy and Sweden and were effective on July 1 2015 The foregoing description is a summary only and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the commitments published by the NCAs on April 21 2015 On July 1 2015 Bookingcom voluntarily implemented the commitments given to the French Italian and Swedish NCAs throughout the European Economic Area and Switzerland Nearly all NCAs in the European Economic Area have now closed their investigations following Bookingcoms implementation of the commitments in their jurisdictions Bookingcom also agreed in 2017 with the NCAs in Australia New Zealand and Georgia to implement the narrow price parity clause in these countries However the Australian NCA indicated in February 2017 that it is reassessing narrow price parity clauses between online travel agencies and accommodation providers In January 2017 the Turkish NCA imposed fines on Bookingcom following an investigation into Bookingcoms wide parity clauses Further to the Turkish NCAs decision Bookingcom has also implemented the narrow price parity clause in Turkey We are in ongoing discussions with various NCAs in other countries regarding their concerns We are currently unable to predict the longterm impact the implementation of these commitments will have on Bookingcoms business on investigations by other countries or on industry practice more generally On December 23 2015 the German NCA issued a final decision prohibiting Bookingcoms narrow price parity agreements with accommodations in Germany The German NCA did not issue a fine but has reserved its position regarding an order for disgorgement of profits Bookingcom is appealing the German NCAs decision An Italian hotel association has appealed the Italian NCAs decision to accept the commitments by Bookingcom A working group of 10 European NCAs France Germany Belgium Hungary Ireland Italy the Netherlands Czech Republic the United Kingdom and Sweden was established by the European Commission in December 2015 to monitor the effects of the narrow price parity clause in Europe This working group the ECN Working Group issued questionnaires during 2016 to online travel agencies including Bookingcom and Expedia metasearch sites and hotels about the narrow price parity clause On April 6 2017 the ECN Working Group published the results of this monitoring exercise The report indicates that the introduction of the narrow price parity clause generally improved conditions for competition Although neither the European Commission nor any of the participating NCAs has opened a new investigation following the publication of the report the ECN Working Group decided to keep the sector under review and reassess the competitive situation in due course We are unable to predict how these appeals and the remaining investigations in other countries will ultimately be resolved or whether further action in Europe will be taken as a result of the ECN Working Groups ongoing review Possible outcomes include requiring Bookingcom to amend or remove its rate parity clause from its contracts with accommodation providers in those jurisdictions andor the imposition of fines 24 A number of European countries have adopted legislation making price parity agreements illegal and it is possible other countries may adopt similar legislation in the future For example in August 2015 French legislation known as the Macron Law became effective Among other things the Macron Law makes price parity agreements illegal including the narrow price parity agreements agreed to by the French NCA in April 2015 Legislation prohibiting narrow price parity agreements became effective in Austria on December 31 2016 and in Italy on August 29 2017 A motion calling on the Swiss government to introduce legislation prohibiting the narrow price parity clause was approved by the Swiss Parliament on September 18 2017 In July 2017 a Belgian government minister announced plans to put forward a similar proposal before the Belgian Parliament It is not yet clear how the Macron Law the Austrian and Italian legislation or the proposed Swiss or Belgian legislation may affect our business in the long term Further the European Commission published a communication in May 2017 on the MidTerm Review on the implementation of the Digital Single Market Strategy As part of the Digital Single Market Strategy the Commission is due to present in the first quarter of 2018 a proposal for legislation addressing relationships between online platforms and businesses including dispute resolution and transparency in search rankings Consumer protection issues including platform search rankings are also being reviewed by European NCAs The United Kingdoms NCA launched a consumer law investigation into the clarity accuracy and presentation of information on hotel booking sites with a specific focus on the display of search results claims regarding discounts methods of pressure selling such as creating false impressions regarding room availability and failure to disclose hidden charges A consumer protection compliance review of car rental booking websites by the UK NCA is also ongoing The consumer protection department of the German NCA announced the opening of a sector inquiry into online price comparison sites in various sectors including travel and hotels on October 24 2017 The Finnish NCA has also recently carried out a consumer survey and issued a questionnaire to hotels in order to gather information about online hotel booking platforms We are unable to predict what if any effect such actions will have on our business industry practices or online commerce more generally To the extent that regulatory authorities impose fines on us or require changes to our business practices or to those currently common to the industry our business competitive position and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected Negative publicity regarding competition investigations could adversely affect our brands and therefore our market share and results of operations Further the Macron Law the Italian and Austrian laws and any similar legislation enacted by other countries and the decision by the German NCA to prohibit narrow price parity agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business and our results of operations in particular if consumers use our services to shop for accommodation reservations but make their reservations directly with an accommodation provider Competitionrelated investigations legislation or issues could also give rise to private litigation For example Bookingcom is involved in private litigation in Sweden related to its narrow price parity provisions We are unable to predict how this litigation will be resolved or whether it will impact Bookingcoms business in Sweden In addition as our business grows we may increasingly become the target of competition investigations or be limited by antitrust or competition laws For example our size and market share may negatively affect our ability to obtain regulatory approval of proposed acquisitions our ability to expand into complementary businesses or our latitude in dealing with travel service providers such as by limiting our ability to provide discounts rebates or incentives or to exercise contractual rights any of which could adversely affect our business results of operations or ability to grow and compete Regulatory and legal requirements and uncertainties could harm our business The services we offer are subject to legal regulations including laws ordinances rules and other requirements and regulations of national and local governments and regulatory authorities around the world many of which are evolving and subject to the possibility of new or revised interpretations Our ability to provide our services is and will continue to be affected by such regulations For example in 2017 our Rentalcarscom business began offering optional rental carrelated insurance products to customers protecting them against accidental damage to their rental vehicles which subjects us to certain insurance regulations and related increased compliance costs and complexities any of which could negatively impact our business and results of operations Similarly laws in some countries relating to data localization payments processing registration as a travel agent and other local requirements could if applicable to us adversely affect our ability to conduct business in those countries The implementation of unfavorable regulations or unfavorable interpretations of existing regulations by judicial or regulatory bodies could require us to incur significant compliance costs cause the development of the affected markets to become impractical and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations For example in March 2017 in connection with a lawsuit begun in 2015 by the Association of Turkish Travel Agencies claiming that Bookingcom is required to meet certain registration requirements in Turkey a Turkish court ordered Bookingcom to suspend 25 offering Turkish hotels and accommodations to Turkish residents Although Bookingcom is appealing the order and believes it to be without basis this order has had and is likely to continue to have a negative impact on our growth and results of operations Certain jurisdictions particularly in Europe are considering regulations intended to address the issue of overtourism including restrictions that may adversely affect our ability to offer accommodations in particular alternative accommodations near city centers or popular tourist destinations To the extent any such regulations require online platforms such as ours to comply with additional restrictions related to offering reservations for accommodations tours and activities or other travel services in such areas we could be subject to increased legal and compliance costs and our business growth and results of operations could be adversely affected Compliance with the laws and regulations of multiple jurisdictions increases our cost of doing business These laws and regulations which vary and sometimes conflict include the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act the UK Bribery Act and local laws which also prohibit corrupt payments to governmental officials or third parties data privacy requirements labor relations laws tax laws antitrust or competition laws US EU or UN sanctioned country or sanctioned persons mandates and consumer protection laws Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines andor criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees andor prohibitions on the conduct of our business Any such violations could result in prohibitions on our ability to offer our services in one or more countries could delay or prevent potential acquisitions and could also materially damage our reputation our brands our international expansion efforts our ability to attract and retain employees our business and our operating results Even if we comply with these laws and regulations doing business in certain jurisdictions could harm our reputation and brands which could adversely affect our results of operations or stock price In addition these restrictions may provide a competitive advantage to our competitors unless they are also subject to comparable restrictions Our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these difficulties We are also subject to a variety of other regulatory and legal risks and challenges in managing an organization operating in various countries including those related to  regulatory changes or other government actions  additional complexity to comply with regulations in multiple jurisdictions as well as overlapping or inconsistent legal regimes in particular with respect to tax labor consumer protection digital content advertising promotions privacy and antitrust laws  difficulties in transferring funds from or converting currencies in certain countries and  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries Our business has grown substantially over the last several years and continues to expand into new geographic locations In addition we have made efforts and expect to make further efforts to integrate access to travel services across our various brands These changes add complexity to legal and tax compliance and our increased size and operating history may increase the likelihood that we will be subject to regulatory scrutiny or audits by tax authorities in various jurisdictions Our stock price is highly volatile The market price of our common stock is highly volatile and is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors such as the following some of which are beyond our control  operating results that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors  quarterly variations in our operating results  changes in expectations as to our future financial performance including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors  worldwide economic conditions in general and in Europe in particular  fluctuations in currency exchange rates particularly between the US Dollar and the Euro  occurrences of a significant security breach  announcements of technological innovations or new services by us or our competitors 26  changes in our capital structure  changes in market valuations of other internet or online service companies  announcements by

us or adverse developments in pending proceedings  additions or departures of key personnel and  trading volume fluctuations Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock including through the conversion of our convertible notes could adversely affect the market price of our common stock by introducing a large number of sellers to the market Given the volatility that exists for our shares such sales could cause the market price of our common stock to decline significantly In addition fluctuations in our stock price and our pricetoearnings multiple may have made our stock attractive to momentum hedge or daytrading investors who often shift funds into and out of stocks rapidly exacerbating price fluctuations in either direction particularly when viewed on a quarterly basis The trading prices of internet company stocks in general including ours have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations To the extent that the publics perception of the prospects of internet or ecommerce companies is negative our stock price could decline regardless of our results Other broad market and industry factors may decrease the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance Market fluctuations as well as general political and economic conditions such as a recession interest rate or currency rate fluctuations political instability eg Brexit and the July 2016 coup attempt in Turkey or a natural disaster or terrorist attack affecting a significant market for our business such as Europe or the United States could cause our stock price to decline Negative market conditions could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital or the value of our stock for purposes of acquiring other companies or businesses We have in the past been a defendant in securities class action litigation Securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities To the extent our stock price declines or is volatile we may in the future be the target of additional litigation This additional litigation could result in substantial costs and divert managements attention and resources either of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations We face increased risks as the level of our debt increases We have a substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness and we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future including through public or private offerings of debt securities Our outstanding indebtedness and any additional indebtedness we incur may have significant consequences which could include  requiring the dedication of a portion of our cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness thereby reducing the amount of cash flow available for other purposes including capital expenditures share repurchases and acquisitions  increased vulnerability to downturns in our business to competitive pressures and to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions 27  decreased or lost ability to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions share repurchases or other general corporate purposes and  decreased flexibility when planning for or reacting to changes in our business and industry Our ability to make payments of principal of and interest on our indebtedness depends upon our future performance which will be subject to general economic conditions industry cycles and financial business and other factors affecting our consolidated results of operations and financial condition many of which are beyond our control Further we may not have access to equity or debt markets or other sources of financing or such financing may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms to repay or refinance our debt as it comes due or in the case of our convertible notes upon conversion We face risks related to our intellectual property We regard our intellectual property as critical to our success and we rely on domain name trademark copyright and patent law trade secret protection and confidentiality andor license agreements with our employees travel service providers partners and others to protect our proprietary rights We have filed various applications for protection of certain aspects of our intellectual property in the United States and other jurisdictions and we currently hold a number of issued patents in several jurisdictions Further in the future we may acquire additional patents or patent portfolios which could require significant cash expenditures However we may choose not to patent or otherwise register some of our intellectual property and instead rely on trade secret or other means of protecting our intellectual property We have licensed in the past and may license in the future certain of our proprietary rights such as trademarks or copyrighted material to third parties and these licensees may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation We also have procured various intellectual property licenses from third parties In addition effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our services are made available online We may be required to expend significant time and resources to prevent infringement or to enforce our intellectual property rights We believe that our intellectual property rights including our issued patents and pending patent applications help to protect our business We endeavor to defend our intellectual property rights diligently but intellectual property litigation is extremely expensive and timeconsuming and may divert managerial attention and resources from our business objectives We may not be able to successfully defend our intellectual property rights or they may not be sufficient to effectively protect our business which could materially adversely affect our business brands and results of operations From time to time in the ordinary course of our business we have been subject to and are currently subject to legal proceedings and claims relating to the intellectual property rights of others and we expect that third parties will continue to assert intellectual property claims in particular patent claims against us particularly as we expand the complexity and scope of our business Successful infringement claims against us could result in a significant monetary liability or prevent us from operating our business or portions of our business In addition resolution of claims may require us to obtain licenses to use intellectual property rights belonging to third parties which may be expensive to procure or possibly to cease using those rights altogether Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition The success of our acquisition of OpenTable is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties On July 24 2014 we acquired OpenTable a leading brand for booking online restaurant reservations We believe that the online restaurant reservation business is complementary to our online travel businesses and that both OpenTable and our travel businesses benefit from the addition of OpenTable to Booking Holdings As a result of our acquisition of OpenTable we are subject to risks associated with OpenTables business many of which are the same risks that our other businesses face Other risks include OpenTables ability to increase the number of restaurants and diners using its products and services and retain existing restaurants and diners OpenTables ability to expand internationally competition both to provide reservation management services to restaurants and to attract diners to make reservations through OpenTables websites and apps OpenTables ability to effectively and efficiently market to new restaurants and diners and any risks that cause people to refrain from dining at restaurants such as economic downturns severe weather outbreaks of pandemic or contagious diseases or threats of terrorist attacks OpenTables postacquisition strategy was premised on significant and rapid investment in international expansion and various other growth initiatives resulting in nearterm reduced earnings and profit margins but with the goal of achieving significantly increased revenues and profitability in the long term As this strategy was achieving limited progress in the third quarter of 2016 OpenTable modified its strategy As a result while OpenTable intends to continue to pursue and invest in international expansion and its other growth initiatives it intends to do so in a more measured and deliberate manner This change in strategy resulted in OpenTable updating its forecasted financial results to reflect a a material reduction in forecasted 28 longterm financial results from these initiatives partially offset by b improved earnings and profit margins in the near term as a result of the reduced investments As previously disclosed based on the updated forecast we estimated a significant reduction in the fair value of the OpenTable business and for the quarter ended September 30 2016 recognized a nondeductible goodwill impairment charge of 9407 million Future events and changing market conditions may lead us to again reevaluate the assumptions reflected in the updated forecast including key assumptions regarding OpenTables expected growth rates and operating margins and the success and timing of its international expansion and other growth initiatives as well as other key assumptions with respect to matters outside of our control such as discount rates currency exchange rates market EBITDA ie earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization comparables and changes in accounting policies or practices including proposed changes affecting the measurement of goodwill andor impairment testing methodology If OpenTable does not achieve the results currently expected if its investments in particular its investments in its international expansion efforts and other growth initiatives are not successful or if any of the assumptions underlying our estimate of the value of the OpenTable business including those mentioned above prove to be incorrect we may further refine our forecast for the OpenTable business and recognize an additional goodwill impairment and an impairment of intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations The value of our investments could decline which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities These securities are predominantly classified as availableforsale and consequently are recorded in our balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss net of tax Our portfolio includes fixedincome securities and equity securities of publicly traded companies the values of which are subject to market price volatility If such investments suffer market price declines we may recognize in earnings the decline in the fair value of our investments below their cost basis when the decline is judged to be other than temporary We have invested a significant amount in Ctrip convertible notes and ADSs See Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding our investments in Ctrip securities Beginning on January 1 2018 changes in fair value of our investment in Ctrip equity securities will be recognized in net income see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements The value of these securities is subject to the risks associated with Ctrips business as well as any changes by the Chinese government in foreign investment laws or elevated scrutiny or regulation of foreign investments in Chinese companies For example because of foreign ownership restrictions applicable to its business Ctrip is a Cayman Islands company operating in China through what is commonly referred to as a variable interest entity or VIE structure where it conducts part of its business through contractual relationships with affiliated Chinese entities Although VIE structures are commonly used by Chinese internet and ecommerce companies there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of PRC laws and regulations to VIE structures and it is possible that the PRC government may view the VIE structure as in violation of PRC law VIE contractual relationships are not as effective in providing control over the affiliated Chinese companies as direct ownership and Ctrip would have to rely on the PRC legal system to enforce those contracts in the event of a breach by one of these entities Further conflicts of interest could arise to the extent Ctrips officers or directors are also shareholders officers or directors of the affiliated Chinese entities Any of these risks could materially and adversely affect Ctrips business and therefore the value of our investment in Ctrip Similar considerations and risks apply in respect of our investment in securities of MeituanDianPing a private Cayman Islands company operating in China through a VIE structure We also invest from time to time in private companies and these investments are generally accounted for under the cost method Such investments are inherently risky in that such companies are typically at an early stage of development may have no or limited revenues may not be or ever become profitable may not be able to secure additional funding or their technologies services or products may not be successfully developed or introduced to the market Further our ability to liquidate any such investments is typically dependent on a liquidity event such as a public offering or acquisition as no public market exists for such securities Valuations of privatelyheld companies are inherently complex and uncertain due to the lack of a liquid market for the companys securities If we determine that any of our investments in such companies have experienced a decline in value we may be required to record an otherthantemporary impairment For example in 2016 we recognized impairments totaling approximately 63 million related to investments in two private companies and in 2017 we recognized an impairment of 76 million related to an investment in one private company We could lose the full amount of any of our investments and any impairment of our investments could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 29 Investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt our ongoing business and present risks not originally contemplated Our mission is to help people experience the world As a result our strategy involves evaluating and potentially entering complementary businesses in furtherance of that mission We have invested and in the future may invest in new business strategies and acquisitions For example we acquired the Momondo Group in July 2017 to enhance the global reach of our metasearch business we entered the restaurant reservation business through our acquisition of OpenTable in 2014 and Bookingcom has invested in its BookingSuite accommodation services business and has begun offering activities such as tours and museum tickets in various locations Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties including distraction of management from current operations greater than expected liabilities and expenses inadequate return on capital new risks with which we are not familiar legal compliance obligations that previously did not apply to us integration risks and difficulties and unidentified issues not discovered in our investigations and evaluations of those strategies and acquisitions As a result entering new businesses involves risks and costs that could if realized have an adverse effect on our business reputation results of operations cash flows or financial condition as well as on our ability to achieve the expected benefits of any such investments or acquisitions We may decide to make minority investments including through joint ventures in which we have limited or no management or operational control The controlling person in such a case may have business interests strategies or goals that are inconsistent with ours and decisions of the company or venture in which we invested may result in harm to our reputation or adversely affect the value of our investment A substantial portion of our goodwill and intangible assets were acquired in acquisitions If we determine that any of the goodwill and intangible assets or any goodwill or intangible assets acquired in future transactions experiences a decline in value we may be required to record an otherthantemporary impairment which could materially adversely affect our results of operations Further we may issue shares of our common stock in these transactions which could result in dilution to our stockholders Our use of open source software could adversely affect our ability to protect our proprietary software and subject us to possible litigation We use open source software in connection with our software development From time to time companies that use open source software have faced claims challenging the use of open source software andor compliance with open source license terms We could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software or claiming noncompliance with open source licensing terms Some open source licenses require users who distribute software containing open source to make available all or part of such software which in some circumstances could include valuable proprietary code of the user While we monitor our use of open source software and try to ensure that none is used in a manner that would require us to disclose our proprietary source code or that would otherwise breach the terms of an open source agreement such use could inadvertently occur in part because open source license terms are often ambiguous Any requirement to disclose our proprietary source code or pay damages for breach of contract could be harmful to our business results of operations or financial condition and could help our competitors develop services that are similar to or better than ours Our business is exposed to risks associated with processing credit card and other payment transactions Because we facilitate the processing of customer credit cards in many of our transactions including a majority of our pricelinecom agodacom and Rentalcarscom transactions our results have been negatively impacted by customer purchases made using fraudulent credit cards We may be held liable for accepting fraudulent credit cards on our websites as well as other payment disputes with our customers Additionally we may be held liable for accepting fraudulent credit cards in certain transactions when we do not facilitate the processing of customer credit cards Accordingly we calculate and record an allowance for the resulting customer chargebacks If we are unable to combat the use of fraudulent credit cards on our websites our business results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected Our Bookingcom business is also increasingly processing transactions on a merchant basis where it facilitates payments including credit card transactions as well as other global payment methods on behalf of customers While this allows Bookingcom to process transactions for properties that do not otherwise accept credit cards and to increase its ability to offer flexible transaction terms to consumers we incur additional payment processing costs chargebacks and other costs related to these transactions As this business continues to grow we may experience a significant increase in such costs or chargebacks and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected In addition in the event that one of our major travel service providers voluntarily or involuntarily declares bankruptcy we could experience an increase in chargebacks from customers with travel reservations with such travel service provider For example airlines that participate in our services and declare bankruptcy or cease operations may be unable or unwilling to 30 honor tickets sold for their flights Our policy in such event is to direct customers seeking a refund or exchange to the airline and not to provide a remedy ourselves Because we process sales of pricelinecoms Express Deals  airline tickets on a merchant basis we could experience a significant increase in demands for refunds or credit card chargebacks from customers which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition We have in the past experienced an increase in chargebacks from customers with tickets on airlines that ceased operations We process credit card transactions and operate in numerous currencies Credit card and other payment processing costs are typically higher for foreign currency transactions and in instances where cancellations occur Cookie laws could negatively impact the way we do business A cookie is a text file that is stored on a users web browser by a website
