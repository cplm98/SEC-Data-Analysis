inventory management asset protection transaction processing customer relations store administration product sales and services staff training and merchandise display that are largely standardized within each store brand All stores within each store brand generally operate under standard procedures with a degree of flexibility for store management to address certain local market characteristics International Segment Our Canada and Mexico store operations are similar to those in our Domestic segment Merchandise and Services Our Domestic and International segments have offerings in six revenue categories Consumer Electronics Computing and Mobile Phones Entertainment Appliances Services and Other The key components of each revenue category are as follows 4 Table of Contents  Consumer

product offerings within our International segment including baby luggage and sporting goods Distribution Domestic Segment US Best Buy online merchandise sales are typically either picked up at US Best Buy stores or delivered directly to customers from a distribution center or retail store Our shipfromstore capability allows us to improve product availability and delivery times for customers Most merchandise is shipped directly from manufacturers to our distribution centers located throughout the US In order to meet release dates for certain products merchandise may be shipped directly to our stores from suppliers International Segment Our Canada and Mexico distribution model is similar to our Domestic segment model Suppliers and Inventory Our Domestic and International segments purchase merchandise from a variety of suppliers In fiscal 2018 our 20 largest suppliers accounted for approximately 70 of the merchandise we purchased with five suppliers  Apple Samsung HewlettPackard Sony and Lenovo  representing approximately 56 of total merchandise purchased We generally do not have longterm written contracts with our vendors that would require them to continue supplying us with merchandise or that secure any of the key terms of our arrangements We carefully monitor and manage our inventory levels in an effort to match quantities on hand with consumer demand as closely as possible Key elements to our inventory management process include the following continuous monitoring of historical and projected consumer demand continuous monitoring and adjustment of inventory receipt levels agreements with vendors relating to reimbursement for the cost of markdowns or sales incentives and agreements with vendors relating to return privileges for certain products We also have a global sourcing operation to design develop test and contractmanufacture our exclusive brand products Store Development We had approximately 1200 largeformat and 300 smallformat stores at the end of fiscal 2018 throughout our Domestic and International segments Our stores are a vital component of our multichannel strategy and we believe they are an important competitive advantage We have the ability to ship from all of our Best Buy stores in the US and all of our largeformat stores in Canada Customers may also elect to pick up orders initiated online in any of our stores Beginning in 2013 we opened vendor storewithinastore concepts to allow closer vendor partnership and a higher quality customer experience In fiscal 2019 and beyond we will continue to look for opportunities to optimize our store space renegotiate leases and selectively open or close locations to support our operations as evidenced by our recent announcement to close all of our remaining Best Buy Mobile standalone stores in the US Refer to Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for tables reconciling our Domestic and International segment stores open at the end of each of the last three fiscal years 5 Table of Contents Intellectual Property We own or have the right to use valuable intellectual property such as trademarks service marks and tradenames including but not limited to Best Buy Best Buy Mobile Best Buy Express Dynex Geek Squad Insignia Magnolia Modal My Best Buy Pacific Sales Pacific Kitchen and Home Rocketfish  Platinum and our Yellow Tag logo We have secured domestic and international trademark and service mark registrations for many of our brands We have also secured patents for many of our inventions We believe our intellectual property has significant value and is an important factor in the marketing of our company our stores our products and our websites Seasonality Our business like that of many retailers is seasonal A large proportion of our revenue and earnings is generated in the fiscal fourth quarter which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season in the US Canada and Mexico Working Capital We fund our business operations through a combination of available cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and cash flows generated from operations In addition our revolving credit facilities are available for additional working capital needs for general corporate purposes and investment and growth opportunities Our working capital needs typically increase in the months leading up to the holiday shopping season as we purchase inventory in advance of expected sales Competition Our competitors are primarily multichannel retailers internetbased businesses technology service providers traditional storebased retailers and vendors and mobile network carriers who offer their products and services directly to customers We believe our ability to deliver a highquality customer experience offers us a key competitive advantage Some of our competitors have lower cost operating structures and seek to compete for sales primarily on price In addition in the US onlineonly operators are not generally required to collect sales taxes in certain states We believe this advantage will continue to be eroded as sales tax rules are reevaluated at both the state and federal levels We carefully monitor pricing offered by other retailers and maintaining price competitiveness is one of our ongoing priorities In addition we have a pricematching policy in the US that allows customers to request that we match a price offered by certain retail store and online operators In order to allow this we are focused on maintaining efficient operations and leveraging the economies of scale available to us through our global vendor partnerships We believe our dedicated and knowledgeable people integrated online and retail assets broad product assortment strong vendor relationships range of focused service and support offerings distinct store formats brand marketing strategies and supply chain are important ways in which we maintain this advantage Environmental Matters We work hard to positively impact the environment and our communities We believe that reducing our impact on the environment via realistic yet assertive sustainability goals and advancing energyefficient consumer solutions helps create longterm value for all of our stakeholders We continuously look for costeffective solutions to minimize carbon emissions in our operations In fiscal 2018 we set a new goal to reduce our own carbon emissions by 60 percent by 2020 over a 2009 baseline from both operational reductions and renewable sourcing and we currently expect to meet or exceed this goal Refer to our Best Buy Corporate Responsibility  Sustainability Report on our website for further information on environmental performance Number of Employees At the end of fiscal 2018 we employed approximately 125000 fulltime parttime and seasonal employees in the US Canada Mexico and our sourcing office in China We consider our employee relations to be good We offer our employees a wide array of companypaid benefits that vary within our company due to customary local practices and statutory requirements which we believe are competitive locally and in the aggregate relative to others in our industry 6 Table of Contents Available Information We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and its rules and regulations The Exchange Act requires us to file

that we believe apply to our business and the industry in which we operate Each of the following risk factors should carefully be considered in conjunction with other information provided in this Annual Report on Form 10K and in our other public disclosures The risks described below highlight potential events trends or other circumstances that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows liquidity or access to sources of financing and consequently the market value of our common stock and debt instruments These risks could cause our future results to differ materially from historical results and from guidance we may provide regarding our expectations of future financial performance The risks described below are not an exhaustive list of all the risks we face There may be others that we have not identified or that we have deemed to be immaterial All forwardlooking statements made by us or on our behalf are qualified by the risks described below We face strong competition from multichannel retailers ecommerce businesses technology service providers traditional storebased retailers and vendors and mobile network carriers that offer their products and services directly to customers which directly affects our revenue and profitability The retail sector is highly competitive Price is of great importance to most customers and price transparency and comparability continues to increase particularly as a result of digital technology The ability of consumers to compare prices on a realtime basis puts additional pressure on us to maintain competitive prices We compete with many other local regional national and international retailers and technology service providers as well as certain of our vendors and mobile network carriers that offer products directly to consumers Some of our competitors have greater financial resources than us have greater brand recognition and may be able to offer lower prices than us for a sustained period of time They may also be able to secure better terms from vendors and devote more resources to technology fulfillment and marketing Competition may also result from new entrants in the markets we serve offering products andor services that compete with us The retail sector continues to experience a trend towards an increase in sales initiated online and using mobile applications and some onlineonly businesses have lower operating costs than us and are not generally required to collect sales taxes in certain US states which can negatively impact the ability of multichannel retailers to be price competitive on a taxincluded basis Online and multichannel retailers continue to focus on delivery services with customers increasingly seeking faster guaranteed delivery times and lowprice or free shipping Our ability to be competitive on delivery times and delivery costs depends on many factors and our failure to successfully manage these factors and offer competitive delivery options could negatively impact the demand for our products and our profit margins Because our business strategy is based on offering superior levels of customer service and a full range of services to complement the products we offer our cost structure is higher than some of our competitors and this in conjunction with price transparency puts pressure on our margins As these and related competitive factors evolve we may experience material adverse pressure on our revenue and profitability 7 Table of Contents Many of the products we sell are highly susceptible to technological advancement product life cycle fluctuations and changes in consumer preferences In general consumer electronics product life cycles which begin with initial market launch and conclude with maturity or obsolescence have become shorter and less predictable This is largely due to rapid technological advancement and innovation and generally faster adoption by consumers Consumer preferences have also become susceptible to rapid change and this adds to the unpredictability of our business These factors affect us in a number of ways for example  the emergence of new products and categories for example voice assistants  the rapid maturity and decline of relatively new categories for example tablets  cannibalization of categories for example the effect of smartphones on demand for GPS mobile audio digital imaging devices etc  increasing demand for internetbased services that may replace physical products such as hard drives media and entertainment software products  intense consumer interest in highprofile product updates for example smartphone model updates which concentrates purchasing activity around new launch dates and can often lead to shortages of merchandise  unpredictable consumer adoption rates for example contrasting adoption rates of 3D and UltraHD televisions  rapidly declining pricepoints in many categories for example digital imaging UltraHD televisions etc and  availability of content for example UltraHD programming online streaming services sporting events or other broadcast programming The effects of these factors can also be exacerbated by the competitive environment and the ease with which customers can research and compare product features and prices If we fail to interpret predict and react to these factors in a timely and effective manner the consequences can include  failure to offer the products and services that our customers want  having excess inventory which may require heavy discounting or liquidation  inability to secure adequate access to brands or products for which consumer demand exceeds supply  delays in adapting our merchandising marketing or supply chain capabilities to accommodate changes in product trends and  damage to our brand and reputation These and other similar factors could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability Our reliance on key vendors and mobile network carriers subjects us to various risks and uncertainties which could affect our revenue and profitability We source the products we sell from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors In fiscal 2018 our 20 largest suppliers accounted for approximately 70 of the merchandise we purchased 77 in fiscal 2017 with 5 suppliers  Apple Samsung HewlettPackard Sony and Lenovo  representing approximately 56 of total merchandise purchased 53 in fiscal 2017 We generally do not have longterm written contracts with our vendors that would require them to continue supplying us with merchandise Our profitability depends on us securing acceptable terms with our vendors for among other things the price of merchandise we purchase from them funding for various forms of promotional programs payment terms allocations of merchandise development of compelling assortments of products operation of vendorfocused shopping experiences within our stores and terms covering returns and factory warranties To varying degrees our vendors may be able to leverage their competitive advantages  for example their financial strength the strength of their brand with customers their own stores or online channels or their relationships with other retailers  to our commercial disadvantage The potential adverse impact of these factors can be amplified by price transparency which can limit our flexibility to modify selling prices and a highly competitive retail environment Generally our ability to negotiate favorable terms with our vendors is more difficult with vendors where our purchases represent a smaller proportion of their total revenues consequently impacting our profitability from such vendor relationships We are also dependent on a relatively small number of mobile carriers to allow us to offer mobile devices with carrier connections The competitive strategies utilized by mobile network carriers can have a material impact on our business For example if carriers change the structure of customer contracts customer upgrade terms customer qualification requirements monthly fee plans cancellation fees or service levels the volume of upgrades and new contracts we sign with customers may be reduced adversely affecting our revenue and profitability In addition our carriers also may serve customers through their own stores websites mobile applications and call centers or through other competing retail channels Carriers may decide to cease allowing us to offer their contracts or certain categories of their contracts focus their marketing efforts on alternative 8 Table of Contents channels or make unfavorable changes to our commissions or other terms Each of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability We have internal standards that we require all of our vendors to meet Our ability to find qualified vendors who can supply products in a timely and efficient manner that meet our standards of quality and safety can be difficult especially with respect to goods sourced from outside the US Political or financial instability merchandise quality issues product safety concerns crossborder trade restrictions or tariffs work stoppages port delays foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations transportation capacity and costs inflation civil unrest natural disasters outbreaks of pandemics and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control Vendors may also fail to invest adequately in design production or distribution facilities may reduce their customer incentives advertising and promotional activities or change their pricing policies These and other related issues could have a material adverse impact on our financial results Product safety and quality concerns could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability If the products we sell fail to meet applicable safety standards or our customers expectations regarding safety and quality we could be exposed to increased legal risk and our reputation may be damaged Failure to take appropriate actions in relation to product recalls could lead to breaches in laws and regulations and leave us susceptible to government enforcement actions or private litigation Recalls of products particularly when combined with lack of available alternatives or our difficulty in sourcing sufficient volumes of replacement products could also have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability Our focus on services as a strategic priority exposes us to certain risks that could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability as well as our reputation We offer a full range of services that complement our product offerings including consultation design delivery installation setup protection plans repair technical support and educational classes Designing marketing and executing these services is subject to incremental risks These risks include for example  increased labor expense to fulfill our customer promises which may be higher than the related revenue  increased risk of errors or omissions in the fulfillment of services  unpredictable warranty failure rates and related expenses  employees in transit using company vehicles to visit customer locations and employees being present in customer homes which may increase our scope of liability  the potential for increased scope of liability relating to managed services offerings  employees having access to customer devices including the information held on those devices which may increase our responsibility for the security of those devices and the data they hold and  the engagement of third parties to assist with some aspects of construction and installation and the potential responsibility for the actions they take and for compliance with building codes and related regulations In addition as customers increasingly migrate to websites and mobile applications to initiate transactions it is inherently more difficult to demonstrate and explain the features and benefits of our service offerings which can lead to a lower revenue mix of these services If for these or other reasons we fail to design and market services effectively to our customers or fail to meet our customers expectations in the execution of these services our reputation revenue and profitability could be adversely affected Macroeconomic pressures in the markets in which we operate could adversely affect consumer spending and our financial results To varying degrees our products and services are sensitive to changes in macroeconomic conditions that impact consumer spending As a result consumers may be affected in many different ways including for example  whether or not they make a purchase  their choice of brand model or pricepoint  how frequently they upgrade or replace their devices and  their appetite for complementary services for example protection plans Real GDP growth consumer confidence inflation employment levels oil prices interest rates tax rates availability of consumer financing housing market conditions foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations costs for items such as fuel and 9 Table of Contents food and other macroeconomic trends can adversely affect consumers demand for the products and services that we offer Our future results could be significantly adversely impacted by these factors Interruptions and other factors affecting our supply chain including inbound deliveries from our vendors may adversely affect our business Our supply chain is a critical part of our operations particularly in light of industry trends and initiatives such as shipfromstore and the emphasis on fast delivery when purchasing online We depend on our vendors ability to deliver products to us at the right location right time and in the right quantities We also depend on third parties for the operation of certain aspects of our supply chain network The factors that can adversely affect these aspects of our operations include  interruptions to our delivery capabilities  failure of third parties to meet our standards or commitments  disruptions to our systems and implementation of new systems  limitations in capacity  consolidation or business failures in the transportation and distribution sectors  labor strikes or slowdowns impacting ports or any other aspect of our supply chain  damages or other loss to products and  costs that are excessive It is important that we be able to maintain optimal levels of inventory in each store and distribution center and respond rapidly to shifting demands Any disruption to or inefficiency in our supply chain network could damage our revenue and profitability The risks associated with our dependence on third parties are greater for small parcel home deliveries because of the relatively small number of carriers with the scope and capacity required by our business The continuing growth of ecommerce increases our exposure to these risks If we fail to manage these risks effectively we could experience a material adverse impact on our reputation revenue and profitability If we fail to attract retain and engage appropriately qualified employees including employees in key positions our operations and profitability may be harmed Changes in market compensation rates may adversely affect our profitability Our performance is highly dependent on attracting retaining and engaging appropriately qualified employees in our stores service centers distribution centers field and corporate offices Our strategy of offering high quality services and assistance for our customers requires a highly trained and engaged workforce The turnover rate in the retail sector is relatively high and there is an ongoing need to recruit and train new employees Factors that affect our ability to maintain sufficient numbers of qualified employees include employee morale our reputation unemployment rates competition from other employers availability of qualified personnel and our ability to offer appropriate compensation packages We operate in a competitive labor market and there is a risk that market increases in compensation could have a material adverse effect on our profitability Failure to recruit or retain qualified employees in the future may impair our efficiency and effectiveness and our ability to pursue growth opportunities In addition a significant amount of turnover of our executive team or other employees in key positions with specific knowledge relating to us our operations and our industry may negatively impact our operations Our strategy to expand into new products services and technologies brings new business financial and regulatory risks As we introduce new products and services using new technologies and applications we may have limited experience in these newer market segments and our customers may not like our new value propositions These offerings may present new and difficult technology challenges and we may be subject to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions or failures or other issues In addition this expansion increases the complexity of our business and places significant strain on our management personnel operations systems technical performance financial resources and internal financial and regulatory control and reporting functions In addition new initiatives we test through trials and pilots may not scale or grow effectively or as we expected which could limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results They may also involve significant laws or regulations that are beyond our current expertise Demand for the products and services we sell could decline if we fail to maintain positive brand perception and recognition We operate a portfolio of brands with a commitment to customer service and innovation We believe that recognition and the reputation of our brands are key to our success Operational factors such as for example failure to deliver high quality services uncompetitive pricing failure to meet delivery promises or business interruptions could damage our reputation 10 Table of Contents External factors such as negative public remarks or accusations could also be damaging The ubiquity of social media means that customer feedback and other information about our company are shared with a broad audience in a manner that is easily accessible and rapidly disseminated Damage to the perception or reputation of our brands could result in among other things declines in customer loyalty decreases in gift card and service plan sales lower employee retention and productivity and vendor relationship issues all of which could materially affect our revenue and profitability Failure to effectively manage our real estate portfolio may negatively impact our operating results Effective management of our real estate portfolio is critical to our multichannel strategy Failure to identify and lease suitable locations for our stores and other facilities could impair our ability to compete successfully and our profitability Most of our properties are subject to longterm leases As such it is essential that we effectively evaluate a range of factors that may influence the success of our longterm real estate strategy Such factors include for example  changing patterns of customer consumption and behavior particularly in light of an evolving multichannel environment  the appropriate number of stores in our portfolio  the formats and sizes of our stores  the locations of our stores  the interior layouts of our stores  the products and services we offer at each store  the trade area demographics and economic factors for each of our stores  the local competitive positioning in and around our stores  the primary term lease commitment for each store  the longterm lease option coverage for each store  the occupancy cost of our stores relative to market rents  our supply chain network strategy and  our ongoing network of service locations If we fail to effectively evaluate these factors or negotiate appropriate terms or if unforeseen changes arise the consequences could include for example  closing stores and abandoning the related assets while retaining the financial commitments of the leases  incurring significant costs to remodel or transform our stores  operating stores supply chain or service locations that no longer meet the needs of our business and  bearing excessive lease expenses These consequences could have a material adverse impact on our profitability cash flows and liquidity For leased property the financial impact of exiting a location can vary greatly depending on among other factors the terms of the lease the condition of the local real estate market demand for the specific property our relationship with the landlord and the availability of potential sublease tenants It is difficult for us to influence some of these factors and the costs of exiting a property can be significant In addition to rent we are still responsible for taxes insurance and common area maintenance charges for vacant properties until the lease commitment expires or is terminated Similarly when we enter into a contract with a tenant to sublease property we usually retain our obligations as the master lessee This leaves us at risk for any remaining liability in the event of default by the sublease tenant Failure to effectively manage our costs could have a material adverse effect on our profitability Some of our operating costs are fixed andor are subject to multiyear contracts Some elements of our costs may be higher than our competitors because of for example our differential service offerings or levels of customer service As discussed above our revenues are susceptible to volatility from various sources which can lead to periods of flat or declining revenues Accordingly our ongoing drive to reduce costs and increase efficiency represents a strategic imperative Failure to successfully manage our costs could have a material adverse impact on our profitability and curtail our ability to fund our growth or other critical initiatives Constraints in the capital markets or our vendor credit terms may have a material adverse impact on our liquidity We need sufficient sources of liquidity to fund our working capital requirements service our outstanding indebtedness and finance business opportunities Without sufficient liquidity we could be forced to curtail our operations or we may not be able 11 Table of Contents to pursue business opportunities The principal sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operating activities available cash and liquid investments credit facilities other debt arrangements and trade payables Our liquidity could be materially adversely impacted if our vendors reduce payment terms andor impose tighter credit limits If our sources of liquidity do not satisfy our requirements we may need to seek additional financing The future availability of financing will depend on a variety of factors such as economic and market conditions the regulatory environment for banks and other financial institutions the availability of credit our credit ratings and our reputation with potential lenders These factors could have a material adverse effect on our costs of borrowing and our ability to pursue business opportunities and threaten our ability to meet our obligations as they become due Changes in our credit ratings may limit our access to capital and materially increase our borrowing costs Our credit ratings and outlooks at March 29 2018  are summarized below In fiscal 2018 Fitch Ratings Limited affirmed its longterm credit rating of BBB and changed its outlook from Stable to Positive In fiscal 2019 Standard  Poors Rating Services upgraded its longterm credit rating of BBB to BBB and changed its outlook from Positive to Stable and Moodys Investors Service Inc affirmed its longterm credit rating of Baa1 with a Stable outlook Rating Agency Rating Outlook Standard  Poors BBB Stable Moodys Baa1 Stable Fitch BBB Positive Any future downgrades to our credit ratings and outlook could negatively impact the perception of our credit risk and thus our access to capital markets borrowing costs vendor terms and lease terms Our credit ratings are based upon information furnished by us or obtained by a rating agency from its own sources and are subject to revision suspension or withdrawal by one or more rating agencies at any time Rating agencies may change the ratings assigned to us due to developments that are beyond our control including the introduction of new rating practices and methodologies We are highly dependent on the cash flows and net earnings we generate during our fourth fiscal quarter which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season Approximately onethird of our revenue and more than onehalf of our net earnings have historically been generated in our fourth fiscal quarter which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season in the US Canada and Mexico In addition the holiday shopping season also incorporates many other unpredictable factors such as the level of competitive promotional activity and customer buying patterns which makes it difficult to forecast and react to these factors quickly Unexpected events or developments such as natural or manmade disasters changes in consumer demand economic factors product sourcing issues failure or interruption of management information systems or disruptions in services or systems provided or managed by thirdparty vendors could significantly disrupt our operations As a result of these factors there is a risk that our fourth quarter and annual results could be adversely affected Failure to effectively manage strategic ventures alliances or acquisitions could have a negative impact on our business We may decide to enter into new joint ventures partnerships alliances or acquisitions with third parties collectively new ventures Assessing the viability of new ventures is typically subject to significant uncertainty and the success of such new ventures can be adversely affected by many factors including for example  different and incremental business risks of the new venture  failure to motivate and retain key employees of the new venture  uncertainty of forecasting financial performance  failure to integrate aspects of the new venture into our existing business such as new product or service offerings or information technology systems  failure to maintain appropriate internal control over financial reporting  failure to generate expected synergies such as cost reductions  unforeseen changes in the business environment of the new venture  disputes or strategic differences with other thirdparty participants in the new venture and  adverse impacts on relationships with vendors and other key partners of our existing business or the new venture 12 Table of Contents If new ventures are unsuccessful our liquidity and profitability could be materially adversely affected and we may be required to recognize material impairments to goodwill and other assets acquired New ventures may also divert our financial resources and managements attention from other important areas of our business Failure to prevent or effectively respond to a breach of the privacy or security of our customer employee vendor or company information could expose us to substantial costs and reputational damage as well as litigation and enforcement actions Our business involves the collection use and storage of customer information including payment card information as well as confidential information regarding our employees vendors and other company information We also share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties as well as use thirdparty technology and systems which transmit customer information for a variety of activities While we take significant steps to protect this information third party criminal activity such as cyberattacks lapses in our controls or the intentional or negligent actions of employees business associates or third parties may undermine our privacy and security measures and unauthorized parties may obtain access to our data systems and misappropriate employee customer and other confidential data Furthermore because the methods used to obtain unauthorized access change frequently and may not be immediately detected we may be unable to anticipate such attacks or promptly and effectively respond to them Any compromise of our customer information or other confidential information could have a material adverse effect on our reputation or our relationships with our customers and partners which may in turn have a negative impact on our revenue and may expose us to material costs penalties and claims Sensitive customer data may also be present on customerowned devices entrusted to us for service and repair Vulnerable code on products sold or serviced including our exclusive brands may also result in a compromise of customer privacy or security Our efforts to protect against such compromises and ensure appropriate handling of customer data on devices we manufacture sell and service may not be effective resulting in potential liability and damage to our customer relationships Increasing costs associated with information security such as increased investment in technology and qualified staff costs of compliance and costs resulting from fraud could cause our business and results of operations to suffer materially Additionally the success of our online operations depends upon the secure transmission of customer and other confidential information over public networks including the use of cashless payments In addition any compromise of our data security may materially increase the costs we incur to protect against such breaches and could subject us to additional legal risk We rely heavily on our information technology systems for our key business processes Any failure or interruption in these systems could have a material adverse impact on our business The effective and efficient operation of our business is dependent on our information technology systems and those of our information technology vendors We rely heavily on these information technology systems to manage all key aspects of our business including demand forecasting purchasing supply chain management pointofsale processing services fulfillment staff planning and deployment financial management reporting and forecasting and safeguarding critical and sensitive information Our information technology systems and those of our partners are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses worms other malicious computer programs denialofservice attacks security breaches through cyberattacks and other malicious actions catastrophic events such as fires tornadoes earthquakes and hurricanes and usage errors by our employees The failure or interruption of these information systems data centers or their backup systems could significantly disrupt our business and cause higher costs and lost revenues and could threaten our ability to remain in operation We also utilize complex information technology platforms to operate our websites and mobile applications If we do not continually invest in securing these systems against attacks or fail to effectively upgrade and maintain our hardware software network and system infrastructure and improve the efficiency and resiliency of our systems it could cause system interruptions and delays Disruptions to these services such as those caused by unforeseen traffic levels malicious attacks other technical difficulties or events outside of our control such as natural disasters power or telecommunications failures or loss of critical data could prevent us from accepting and fulfilling customer orders for products or services which could cause us to forgo material revenues incur material costs and adversely affect our reputation Catastrophic events could adversely affect our operating results The risk or actual occurrence of various catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance Such events may be caused by for example 13 Table of Contents  natural disasters or extreme weather events  diseases or epidemics that may affect our employees customers or partners  floods fire or other catastrophes affecting our properties  cybersecurity breaches or  terrorism civil unrest or other conflicts Such events can adversely affect our work force and prevent employees and customers from reaching our stores and properties and can disrupt or disable portions of our supply chain and distribution network They can also affect our information systems resulting in disruption to various aspects of our operations including our ability to transact with customers and fulfill orders As a consequence of these or other catastrophic events we may endure interruption to our operations or losses of property equipment or inventory which would adversely affect our revenue and profitability Our exclusive brands products are subject to several additional product supply chain and legal risks that could affect our operating results Sales of our exclusive brands products which include Insignia Modal Dynex Platinum and Rocketfish branded products represent an important component of our product offerings and our revenue and profitability Most of these products are manufactured by contract manufacturers based in southeast Asia This arrangement exposes us to the following additional potential risks which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  we have greater exposure and responsibility to consumers for warranty replacements and repairs as a result of exclusive brand product defects and our recourse to contract manufacturers for such warranty liabilities may be limited in foreign jurisdictions

financing and credit cards issued by thirdparty banks that manage and directly extend credit to our customers Customers choosing promotional financing can receive extended payment terms and low or
