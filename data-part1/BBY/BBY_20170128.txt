Operations Our Domestic and International segments are managed by leadership teams responsible for all areas of the business Both segments operate an omnichannel platform that provides customers the ability to shop when and where they want Domestic Segment Development of merchandise and services offerings pricing and promotions procurement and supply chain online and mobile application operations marketing and advertising and labor deployment across all channels are centrally managed at our corporate headquarters In addition support capabilities for example human resources finance and real estate management are generally performed at our corporate headquarters We also have field operations that support retail teams from our corporate headquarters and regional locations Our retail stores have procedures for inventory management asset protection transaction processing customer relations store administration product sales and services staff training and merchandise display that are largely standardized within each store brand All stores within each store brand generally operate under standard procedures with a degree of flexibility for store management to address certain local market characteristics International Segment Our Canada and Mexico store operations are similar to those in our Domestic segment Merchandise and Services Our Domestic and International segments have offerings in six revenue categories Consumer Electronics Computing and Mobile Phones Entertainment Appliances Services and Other The key components of each revenue category are as follows 4 Table of Contents  Consumer Electronics  home theater home automation digital imaging health and fitness and portable audio  Computing and Mobile Phones  computing and peripherals networking tablets mobile phones including related mobile network carrier commissions wearables including smart watches and ereaders  Entertainment  gaming hardware and software movies music technology toys and other software  Appliances  major appliances for example refrigeration dishwashers ovens laundry etc and small appliances for example coffee makers blenders etc  Services  consultation design delivery installation setup protection plans repair technical support and educational classes and  Other  snacks beverages and other sundry items Distribution Domestic Segment US Best Buy online merchandise sales are typically either picked up at US Best Buy stores or delivered directly to customers from a distribution center or retail store The shipfromstore capability allows us to improve product availability and delivery times for customers Most merchandise is shipped directly from manufacturers to our distribution centers located throughout the US In order to meet release dates for certain products merchandise may be shipped directly to our stores from suppliers International Segment Our Canada and Mexico distribution model is similar to our Domestic segment model Suppliers and Inventory Our Domestic and International segments purchase merchandise from a variety of suppliers In fiscal 2017 our 20 largest suppliers accounted for approximately 77 of the merchandise we purchased with five suppliers  Apple Samsung Sony HewlettPackard and LG Electronics  representing approximately 53 of total merchandise purchased We generally do not have longterm written contracts with our vendors that would require them to continue supplying us with merchandise or secure any of the key terms of our arrangements We carefully monitor and manage our inventory levels in an effort to match quantities on hand with consumer demand as closely as possible Key elements to our inventory management process include the following continuous monitoring of historical and projected consumer demand continuous monitoring and adjustment of inventory receipt levels agreements with vendors relating to reimbursement for the cost of markdowns or sales incentives and agreements with vendors relating to return privileges for certain products We also have a global sourcing operation to design develop test and contractmanufacture our exclusive brand products Store Development We had approximately 1200 largeformat and 400 smallformat stores at the end of fiscal 2017 throughout our Domestic and International segments Our stores are a vital component of our omnichannel strategy and represent an important competitive advantage In the US we have the ability to ship from all of our Best Buy stores Customers may also elect to pick up orders initiated online in any of our stores In recent years we have opened vendor storewithinastore concepts to allow closer vendor partnership and a better quality customer experience In fiscal 2018 and beyond we will continue to look for opportunities to optimize our store space renegotiating leases and selectively opening or closing locations to support our operations In March 2015 we made a decision to consolidate Future Shop and Best Buy stores and websites in Canada under the Best Buy brand This resulted in permanently closing 66 Future Shop stores and converting 65 Future Shop stores to the Best Buy brand Refer to Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for tables reconciling our Domestic and International segment stores open at the end of each of the last three fiscal years 5 Table of Contents Intellectual Property We own or have the right to use valuable intellectual property such as trademarks service marks and tradenames including but not limited to Best Buy Best Buy Mobile Dynex Geek Squad Insignia Magnolia Modal My Best Buy Pacific Sales Rocketfish  Platinum and our Yellow Tag logo We have secured domestic and international trademark and service mark registrations for many of our brands We have also secured patents for many of our inventions We believe our intellectual property has significant value and is an important factor in the marketing of our company our stores our products and our websites Seasonality Our business like that of many retailers is seasonal A higher proportion of our revenue and earnings is generated in the fiscal fourth quarter which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season in the US Canada and Mexico Working Capital We fund our business operations through a combination of available cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and cash flows generated from operations In addition our revolving credit facilities are available for additional working capital needs for general corporate purposes and investment and growth opportunities Our working capital needs typically increase in the months leading up to the holiday shopping season as we purchase inventory in advance of expected sales Competition Our competitors are primarily multichannel retailers internetbased businesses technology service providers traditional storebased retailers and vendors and mobile network carriers who offer their products and services directly to customers We believe our ability to deliver a high quality customer experience offers us a key competitive advantage Some of our competitors have low cost operating structures and seek to compete for sales primarily on price In addition in the US onlineonly operators are exempt from collecting sales taxes in certain states We believe this advantage will continue to be eroded as sales tax rules are reevaluated at both the state and federal levels We carefully monitor pricing offered by other retailers and maintaining price competitiveness is one of our ongoing priorities In addition we have a pricematching policy in the US that allows customers to request that we match a price offered by certain retail store and online operators In order to allow this we are focused on maintaining efficient operations and leveraging the economies of scale available to us through our global vendor partnerships We believe our dedicated and knowledgeable people integrated online and retail assets broad product assortment strong vendor relationships range of focused service and support offerings distinct store formats brand marketing strategies and supply chain are important ways in which we maintain this advantage Environmental Matters Best Buy is committed to positively impacting the environment and our communities We believe that effectively managing our environmental impacts setting sustainability goals and advancing energyefficient consumer solutions create longterm value for all of our stakeholders We are continuously looking for costeffective solutions to minimize carbon emissions in our operations In fiscal year 2016 we set a new goal to reduce our own carbon emissions by 45 percent by 2020 over a 2009 baseline from both operational reductions and renewable sourcing See our Best Buy Corporate Responsibility  Sustainability Report for further information on environmental performance Number of Employees At the end of fiscal 2017 we employed approximately 125000 fulltime parttime and seasonal employees in the US Canada Mexico and our sourcing office in China We consider our employee relations to be good We offer our employees a wide array of companypaid benefits that vary within our company due to customary local practices and statutory requirements which we believe are competitive locally and in the aggregate relative to others in our industry 6 Table of Contents Available Information We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 the Exchange Act and its

Risk Factors Described below are certain risks that we believe apply to our business and the industry in which we operate You should carefully consider each of the following risk factors in conjunction with other information provided in this Annual Report on Form 10K and in our other public disclosures The risks described below highlight potential events trends or other circumstances that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows liquidity or access to sources of financing and consequently the market value of our common stock and debt instruments These risks could cause our future results to differ materially from historical results and from guidance we may provide regarding our expectations of future financial performance The risks described below are not an exhaustive list of all the risks we face There may be others that we have not identified or that we have deemed to be immaterial All forwardlooking statements made by us or on our behalf are qualified by the risks described below We face strong competition from multichannel retailers ecommerce businesses technology service providers traditional storebased retailers and vendors and mobile network carriers that offer their products and services directly to customers which directly affects our revenue and profitability The retail business is highly competitive Price is of great importance to most customers and price transparency and comparability continues to increase particularly as a result of digital technology The ability of consumers to compare prices on a realtime basis puts additional pressure on us to maintain competitive prices We compete with many other local regional national and international retailers and technology service providers as well as certain of our vendors and mobile network carriers that offer products directly to consumers Some of our competitors have greater financial resources than us and may be able to offer lower prices than us for a sustained period of time The retail industry continues to experience a trend towards an increase in sales initiated online and using mobile applications and some onlineonly businesses have lower operating costs than us and are not required to collect and remit sales taxes in all US states which can negatively impact the ability of multichannel retailers to be price competitive on a taxincluded basis Online and multichannel retailers continue to focus on delivery services with customers increasingly seeking faster guaranteed delivery times and lowprice or free shipping Our ability to be competitive on delivery times and delivery costs depends on many factors and our failure to successfully manage these factors and offer competitive delivery options could negatively impact the demand for our products and our profit margins Because our business strategy is based on offering superior levels of customer service and a full range of services to complement the products we offer our cost structure is higher than some of our competitors and this in conjunction with price transparency puts pressure on our margins As these and related competitive factors evolve we may experience material adverse pressure on our revenue and profitability Many of the products we sell are highly susceptible to technological advancement product life cycle fluctuations and changes in consumer preferences 7 Table of Contents In general consumer electronics product life cycles which begin with initial market launch and conclude with maturity or obsolescence have become shorter and less predictable This is largely due to rapid technological advancement and innovation and generally faster adoption by consumers Consumer preferences have also become susceptible to rapid change and this adds to the unpredictability of our business These factors affect us in a number of ways for example  the emergence of new products and categories for example virtual reality  the rapid maturity and decline of relatively new categories for example tablets  cannibalization of categories for example the effect of smart phones on demand for GPS mobile audio digital imaging devices etc  intense consumer interest in highprofile product updates for example smartphone model updates which concentrates purchasing activity around new launch dates and can often lead to shortages of merchandise  unpredictable consumer adoption rates for example contrasting adoption rates of 3D and UltraHD televisions  rapidly declining pricepoints in many categories for example digital imaging UltraHD televisions etc and  availability of content for example UltraHD programming online streaming services sporting events or other broadcast programming The effects of these factors can also be exacerbated by the competitive environment and the ease with which customers can research and compare product features and price If we fail to interpret predict and react to these factors in a timely and effective manner the consequences can include  not offering the products and services that our customers want  having excess inventory which may require heavy discounting or liquidation  not securing adequate access to brands or products for which consumer demand exceeds supply  delays in adapting our merchandising marketing or supply chain capabilities to accommodate changes in product trends and  damage to our brand and reputation These and other similar factors could have a material adverse impact on our revenues and profitability Our reliance on key vendors and mobile network carriers subjects us to various risks and uncertainties which could affect our revenue and profitability We source the products we sell from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors In fiscal 2017 our 20 largest suppliers accounted for approximately 77 of the merchandise we purchased 75 in fiscal 2016 with 5 suppliers  Apple Samsung Sony HewlettPackard and LG Electronics  representing approximately 53 of total merchandise purchased 51 in fiscal 2016 We generally do not have longterm written contracts with our vendors that would require them to continue supplying us with merchandise Our profitability depends on us securing acceptable terms with our vendors for among other things the price of merchandise we purchase from them funding for various forms of promotional programs payment terms allocations of merchandise development of compelling assortments of products operation of vendorfocused shopping experiences within our stores and terms covering returns and factory warranties To varying degrees our vendors may be able to leverage their competitive advantages  for example their financial strength the strength of their brand with customers their own stores or online channels or their relationships with other retailers  to our commercial disadvantage The potential adverse impact of these factors can be amplified by price transparency which can limit our flexibility to modify selling prices and a highly competitive retail environment Generally our ability to negotiate favorable terms with our vendors is more difficult with vendors where our purchases represent a smaller proportion of their total revenues consequently impacting our profitability from such vendor relationships We are also dependent on a relatively small number of mobile carriers to allow us to offer mobile devices with carrier connections The competitive strategies utilized by mobile network carriers can have a material impact on our business For example if carriers change the structure of customer contracts customer upgrade terms customer qualification requirements monthly fee plans cancellation fees or service levels the volume of upgrades and new contracts we sign with customers may be reduced adversely affecting our revenues and profitability In addition our carriers also may serve customers through their own stores websites mobile applications and call centers or through other competing retail channels Carriers may decide to cease allowing us to offer their contracts or certain categories of their contracts focus their marketing efforts on alternative channels or make unfavorable changes to our commissions or other terms Each of these factors could have a materially adverse impact on our revenue and profitability We have internal standards that we require all of our vendors to meet Our ability to find qualified vendors who can supply products in a timely and efficient manner that meet our standards of quality and safety can be difficult especially with respect 8 Table of Contents to goods sourced from outside the US Political or financial instability merchandise quality issues product safety concerns crossborder trade restrictions or tariffs work stoppages port delays foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations transportation capacity and costs inflation civil unrest natural disasters outbreaks of pandemics and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control These and other related issues could materially adversely affect our financial results Product safety and quality concerns could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability If the products we sell fail to meet applicable safety standards or our customers expectations regarding safety and quality we could be exposed to increased legal risk and our reputation may be damaged Failure to take appropriate actions in relation to product recalls could lead to breaches in laws and regulations and leave us susceptible to government enforcement actions or private litigation Recalls of products particularly when combined with lack of available alternatives or our difficulty in sourcing sufficient volumes of replacement products could also have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability Our focus on services as a strategic priority exposes us to certain risks that could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability as well as our reputation We offer a full range of services that complement our product offerings including consultation design delivery installation setup protection plans repair technical support and educational classes Designing marketing and executing these services is subject to incremental risks These risks include for example  increased labor expense to fulfill our customer promises which may be higher than the related revenue  unpredictable warranty failure rates and related expenses  employees in transit using company vehicles to visit customer locations and employees being present in customer homes which may increase our scope of liability  the potential for increased scope of liability relating to managed services offerings  employees having access to customer devices including the information held on those devices which may increase our responsibility for the security of those devices and the data they hold and  the engagement of third parties to assist with some aspects of construction and installation and the potential responsibility for the actions they take and for compliance with building codes and related regulations In addition as customers increasingly migrate to websites and mobile applications to initiate transactions it is inherently more difficult to demonstrate and explain the features and benefits of our service offerings which can lead to a lower revenue mix of these services If for these or other reasons we fail to design and market services effectively to our customers or fail to meet our customers expectations in the execution of these services our reputation revenue and profitability could be adversely affected Macroeconomic pressures in the markets in which we operate could adversely affect consumer spending and our financial results To varying degrees our products and services are sensitive to changes in macroeconomic conditions that impact consumer spending As a result consumers may be affected in many different ways including for example  whether or not they make a purchase  their choice of brand model or pricepoint  how frequently they upgrade or replace their devices and  their appetite for complementary services for example protection plans Consumer confidence inflation employment levels oil prices interest rates tax rates availability of consumer financing housing market conditions foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations costs for items such as fuel and food and other macroeconomic trends can adversely affect consumers demand for the products and services that we offer Our future results could be significantly adversely impacted by these factors Interruptions and other factors affecting our supply chain including inbound deliveries from our vendors may adversely affect our business Our supply chain is a critical part of our operations particularly in light of recent industry trends and initiatives such as shipfromstore and the emphasis on fast and free delivery when purchasing online We depend on our vendors ability to deliver 9 Table of Contents products to us at the right location right time and in the right quantities We also depend on third parties for the operation of certain aspects of our supply chain network The factors that can adversely affect these aspects of our operations include  interruptions to our delivery capabilities  failure of third parties to meet our standards or commitments  disruptions to our systems and implementation of new systems  limitations in capacity  consolidation or business failures in the transportation and distribution sectors  labor strikes or slowdowns impacting ports or any other aspect of our supply chain  damages or other loss to products and  costs that are excessive The risks associated with our dependence on third parties are greater for small parcel home deliveries because of the relatively small number of carriers with the scope and capacity required by our business The continuing growth of ecommerce increases our exposure to these risks If we fail to manage these risks effectively we could experience a material adverse impact on our reputation revenue and profitability If we fail to attract retain and engage appropriately qualified employees including employees in key positions our operations and profitability may be harmed Changes in market compensation rates may adversely affect our profitability Our performance is highly dependent on attracting retaining and engaging appropriately qualified employees in our stores service centers distribution centers field and corporate offices Our strategy of offering high quality services and assistance for our customers requires a highly trained and engaged workforce The turnover rate in the retail industry is relatively high and there is an ongoing need to recruit and train new employees Factors that affect our ability to maintain sufficient numbers of qualified employees include employee morale our reputation unemployment rates competition from other employers availability of qualified personnel and our ability to offer appropriate compensation packages We operate in a competitive labor market and there is a risk that market increases in compensation could have a material adverse effect on our profitability Failure to recruit or retain qualified employees in the future may impair our efficiency and effectiveness and our ability to pursue growth opportunities In addition a significant amount of turnover of our executive team or other employees in key positions with specific knowledge relating to us our operations and our industry may negatively impact our operations Demand for the products and services we sell could decline if we fail to maintain positive brand perception and recognition We operate a portfolio of brands with a commitment to customer service and innovation We believe that recognition and the reputation of our brands are key to our success The ubiquity of social media means that customer feedback and other information about our company are shared with a broad audience in a manner that is easily accessible and rapidly disseminated Damage to the perception or reputation of our brands could result in among other things declines in customer loyalty decreases in gift card and service plan sales lower employee retention and productivity and vendor relationship issues all of which could materially affect our revenue and profitability Our success is dependent on the design and execution of appropriate business strategies We operate in a highlycompetitive and everchanging commercial environment Our success is dependent on our ability to identify develop and execute appropriate strategies within this environment Strategies that have proved successful in the past may not be successful in the future Our current strategy includes continuous improvement of our business and the pursuit of new growth opportunities It is possible that our strategies may be ineffective and that we may need to make substantial changes to them in the future It is also possible that we will be unsuccessful in executing our strategies or that they expose us to additional risks Our results could be materially adversely affected if we fail to develop and execute appropriate strategies The market value of our common stock and debt instruments could be materially adversely affected if investors are uncertain about the appropriateness of our strategies or our ability to execute them Refer to Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  for further information regarding our strategies Failure to effectively manage our real estate portfolio may negatively impact our operating results 10 Table of Contents Effective management of our real estate portfolio is critical to our multichannel strategy Most of our properties are subject to longterm leases As such it is essential that we effectively evaluate a range of factors that may influence the success of our longterm real estate strategy Such factors include for example  changing patterns of customer consumption and behavior particularly in light of an evolving omnichannel environment  the appropriate number of stores in our portfolio  the formats and sizes of our stores  the locations of our stores  the interior layouts of our stores  the trade area demographics and economic data of each of our stores  the local competitive positioning in and around our stores  the primary term lease commitment for each store  the longterm lease option coverage for each store  the occupancy cost of our stores relative to market rents  our supply chain network strategy and  our ongoing network of service locations If we fail to effectively evaluate these factors or negotiate appropriate terms or if unforeseen changes arise the consequences could include for example  having to close stores and abandon the related assets while retaining the financial commitments of the leases  incurring significant costs to remodel or transform our stores  having stores supply chain or service locations that no longer meet the needs of our business and  bearing excessive lease expenses These consequences could have a materially adverse impact on our profitability cash flows and liquidity For leased property the financial impact of exiting a location can vary greatly depending on among other factors the terms of the lease the condition of the local real estate market demand for the specific property our relationship with the landlord and the availability of potential sublease tenants It is difficult for us to influence some of these factors and the costs of exiting a property can be significant In addition to rent we are still responsible for the maintenance taxes insurance and common area maintenance charges for vacant properties until the lease commitment expires or is terminated Similarly when we enter into a contract with a tenant to sublease property we usually retain our obligations as the master lessor This leaves us at risk for any remaining liability in the event of default by the sublease tenant Failure to effectively manage our costs could have a material adverse effect on our profitability Some of our operating costs are fixed andor are subject to multiyear contracts Some elements of our costs may be higher than our competitors because of for example our differential service offerings or levels of customer service As discussed above our revenues are susceptible to volatility from various sources which can lead to periods of flat or declining revenues Accordingly our ongoing drive to reduce cost and increase efficiency represents a strategic imperative Failure to successfully manage our costs could have a material adverse impact on our profitability and curtail our ability to fund our growth or other critical initiatives Our liquidity may be materially adversely affected by constraints in the capital markets or our vendor credit terms We need sufficient sources of liquidity to fund our working capital requirements service our outstanding indebtedness and finance business opportunities Without sufficient liquidity we could be forced to curtail our operations or we may not be able to pursue business opportunities The principal sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operating activities available cash and liquid investments credit facilities other debt arrangements and trade payables Our liquidity could be materially adversely impacted if our vendors reduce payment terms andor impose tighter credit limits If our sources of liquidity do not satisfy our requirements we may need to seek additional financing The future availability of financing will depend on a variety of factors such as economic and market conditions the regulatory environment for banks and other financial institutions the availability of credit and our credit ratings and our reputation with potential lenders These factors could materially adversely affect our costs of borrowing and our ability to pursue business opportunities and threaten our ability to meet our obligations as they become due Changes in our credit ratings may limit our access to capital and materially increase our borrowing costs 11 Table of Contents Our credit ratings and outlooks at March 20 2017  are summarized below In fiscal 2017 Standard  Poors Rating Services upgraded its longterm credit rating from BB to BBB with a Stable outlook Moodys Investors Service Inc affirmed its longterm credit rating of Baa1 with a Stable outlook and Fitch Ratings Limited affirmed its longterm credit rating of BBB with a Stable outlook Rating Agency Rating Outlook Standard  Poors BBB Stable Moodys Baa1 Stable Fitch BBB Stable Any future downgrades to our credit ratings and outlook could negatively impact the perception of our credit risk and thus our access to capital markets borrowing costs vendor terms and lease terms Our credit ratings are based upon information furnished by us or obtained by a rating agency from its own sources and are subject to revision suspension or withdrawal by one or more rating agencies at any time Rating agencies may change the ratings assigned to us due to developments that are beyond our control including the introduction of new rating practices and methodologies We are highly dependent on the cash flows and net earnings we generate during our fourth fiscal quarter which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season Approximately onethird of our revenue and more than onehalf of our net earnings have historically been generated in our fourth fiscal quarter which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season in the US Canada and Mexico In addition the holiday shopping season also incorporates many other unpredictable factors such as the level of competitive promotional activity and customer buying patterns which makes it difficult to forecast and react to these factors quickly Unexpected events or developments such as natural or manmade disasters economic factors product sourcing issues failure or interruption of management information systems or disruptions in services or systems provided or managed by thirdparty vendors could significantly disrupt our operations As a result of these factors there is a risk that our fourth quarter and annual results could be adversely affected Failure to effectively manage strategic ventures alliances or acquisitions could have a negative impact on our business We may decide to enter into new joint ventures partnerships alliances or acquisitions with third parties collectively new ventures Assessing the viability of new ventures is typically subject to significant uncertainty and the success of such new ventures can be adversely affected by many factors including for example  different and incremental business risks of the new venture  failure to motivate and retain key employees of the new venture  uncertainty of forecasting financial performance  failure to integrate aspects of the new venture into our existing business such as new product or service offerings or information technology systems  failure to maintain appropriate internal control over financial reporting  failure to generate expected synergies such as cost reductions  unforeseen changes in the business environment of the new venture  disputes or strategic differences with other third party participants in the new venture and  adverse impacts on relationships with vendors and other key partners of our existing business or the new venture If new ventures are unsuccessful our liquidity and profitability could be materially adversely affected and we may be required to recognize material impairments to goodwill and other assets acquired New ventures may also divert our financial resources and managements attention from other important areas of our business Failure to protect or effectively respond to breach of the integrity security and confidentiality of our employee and customer data could expose us to litigation costs and materially damage our standing with our employees or customers The use and handling of personally identifiable data by our business our business associates and third parties is regulated at the state federal and international levels We are also contractually obligated to comply with certain industry standards regarding payment card information Increasing costs associated with information security such as increased investment in technology and qualified staff the costs of compliance and costs resulting from fraud could cause our business and results of operations to suffer materially Additionally the success of our online operations depends upon the secure transmission of customer and other 12 Table of Contents confidential information over public networks including the use of cashless payments While we take significant steps to protect this information lapses in our controls or the intentional or negligent actions of employees business associates or third parties or failure to effectively respond to such compromises may undermine our security measures As a result unauthorized parties may obtain access to our data systems and misappropriate employee customer and other confidential data Advances in computer capabilities new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments may not prevent the compromise of our customer transaction processing capabilities and customer personal data Furthermore because the methods used to obtain unauthorized access change frequently and may not be immediately detected we may be unable to anticipate these methods or promptly implement preventative measures Any such compromise of our security or the security of information residing with our business associates or third parties could have a material adverse effect on our reputation or our relationship with our employees which may in turn have a negative impact on our revenue and may expose us to material costs penalties and compensation claims In addition any compromise of our data security may materially increase the costs we incur to protect against such breaches and could subject us to additional legal risk Catastrophic events could adversely affect our operating results The risk or actual occurrence of various catastrophic events could materially adversely affect our financial performance Such events may be caused by for example  natural disasters or extreme weather events  diseases or epidemics that may affect our employees customers or partners  floods fire or other catastrophes affecting our properties or  terrorism civil unrest or other conflicts Such events can adversely affect our work force and prevent employees and customers from reaching our stores and properties and can disrupt or disable portions of our supply chain and distribution network As a consequence of these or other catastrophic events we may endure interruption to our operations or losses of property equipment or inventory which would adversely affect our revenue and profitability Our exclusive brands products are subject to several additional product supply chain and legal risks that could affect our operating results Sales of our exclusive brands products which include Insignia Modal Dynex Init Platinum and Rocketfish branded products represent an important component of our product offerings and our revenue and profitability Most of these products are manufactured by contract manufacturers based in southeastern Asia This arrangement exposes us to the following additional potential risks which could materially adversely affect our operating results  we have greater exposure and responsibility to consumers for warranty replacements and repairs as a result of exclusive brand product defects and our recourse to contract manufacturers for such warranty liabilities may be limited in foreign jurisdictions  we may be subject to regulatory compliance andor product liability claims relating to personal injury death or property damage caused by exclusive brand products some of which may require us to take significant actions such as product recalls  we may experience disruptions in manufacturing or logistics due to inconsistent and unanticipated order patterns our inability to develop longterm relationships with key manufacturers or unforeseen natural disasters  we may not be able to locate manufacturers that meet our internal standards whether for new exclusive brand products or for migration of the manufacturing of products from an existing manufacturer  we are subject to developing and oftenchanging labor and environmental laws for the manufacture of products in foreign countries and we may be unable to conform to new rules or interpretations in a timely manner  we may be subject to claims by technology or other intellectual property owners if we inadvertently infringe upon their patents or other intellectual property rights or if we fail to pay royalties owed on our exclusive brand products  we may be unable to obtain or adequately protect patents and other intellectual property rights on our exclusive brand products or manufacturing processes and  regulations regarding disclosure of efforts to identify the country of origin of conflict minerals in certain portions of our supply chain could increase the cost of doing business and depending on the findings of our country of origin inquiry could have an adverse effect on our reputation Maintaining consistent quality availability and competitive pricing of our exclusive brands products helps us build and maintain customer loyalty generate revenue and achieve acceptable margins Failure to maintain these factors could have a significant adverse impact on the demand for exclusive brand products and the profits we are able to generate from them 13 Table of Contents We are subject to certain statutory regulatory and legal developments which could have a material adverse impact on our business Our statutory regulatory and legal environments expose us to complex compliance and litigation risks that could materially adversely affect our operations Some of the most significant compliance and litigation risks we face are  the difficulty of complying with sometimes conflicting statutes and regulations in local national or international jurisdictions  the potential for unexpected costs related to compliance with new or existing environmental legislation or international agreements affecting energy carbon emissions electronics recycling and water or product materials  ensuring compliance with applicable product compliance laws and regulations with respect to both the products we sell and contract to manufacture including laws and regulation related to product safety and product transport  the impact of new regulations governing data privacy and security whether imposed as a result of increased cybersecurity risks or otherwise  the impact of other new or changing statutes and regulations including but not limited to financial reform National Labor Relations Board rule changes health care reform corporate governance matters escheatment rules andor other as yet unknown legislation that could affect how we operate and execute our strategies as well as alter our expense structure  the impact of the potential implementation of more restrictive trade policies or the renegotiation of existing trade agreements in the US or countries where we sell our products and services or procure products  the impact of potential changes in US or other countries tax laws and regulations including the imposition of the border adjustment tax on imported products as is currently being discussed by US Congress that could increase the cost of the products we sell because a significant portion of the products we sell in the US are sourced from outside of the country and  the impact of litigation trends including class action lawsuits involving consumers and shareholders and labor and employment matters Regulatory activity focused on the retail industry has grown in recent years increasing the risk of fines and additional operating costs associated with compliance

our reputation our ability to continue operations and our profitability Economic regulatory and other developments could adversely affect our ability to offer attractive promotional financing to our customers and adversely affect the profits we generate from these programs We offer promotional financing and credit cards issued by thirdparty banks that manage and directly extend credit to our

was transacted using one of the companys branded cards In addition we earn profitshare income from our banking partners based on the performance of the programs The income we earn in this regard is
