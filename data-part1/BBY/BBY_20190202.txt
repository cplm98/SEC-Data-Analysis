deployment across all channels are centrally managed In addition support capabilities for example human resources finance and real estate management are generally performed at our corporate headquarters We also have field operations that support retail services and inhome teams from our corporate headquarters and regional locations Our retail stores have procedures for inventory management asset protection transaction processing customer relations store administration product sales and services staff training and merchandise display that are largely standardized All stores generally operate under standard procedures with a degree of flexibility for store management to address certain local market characteristics International Segment Our Canada and Mexico operations are similar to those in our Domestic segment Merchandise and Services Our Domestic and International segments have offerings in six revenue categories Computing and Mobile Phones Consumer Electronics Appliances Entertainment Services and Other These categories provide products and services to our customers that address key human needs across a range of areas including entertainment productivity

baby luggage and sporting goods Distribution Domestic Segment Customers who purchase products online have the choice to pick up product at US Best Buy stores or have it delivered directly to them from a distribution center or retail store Our shipfromstore capability allows us to improve product availability and delivery times for customers Most merchandise is shipped directly from manufacturers to our distribution centers located throughout the US In order to meet release dates for certain products merchandise may be shipped directly to our stores from suppliers International Segment Our Canada and Mexico distribution model is similar to that of our Domestic segment Suppliers and Inventory Our Domestic and International segments purchase merchandise from a variety of suppliers In fiscal 2019 our 20 largest suppliers accounted for approximately 64 of the merchandise we purchased with five suppliers  Apple Samsung HewlettPackard Sony and LG  representing approximately 51 of total merchandise purchased We generally do not have longterm written contracts with our vendors that would require them to continue supplying us with merchandise or that secure any of the key terms of our arrangements We carefully monitor and manage our inventory levels in an effort to match quantities on hand with consumer demand as closely as possible Key elements to our inventory management process include the following continuous monitoring of historical and projected consumer demand continuous monitoring and adjustment of inventory receipt levels and pricing agreements with vendors relating to reimbursement for the cost of markdowns or sales incentives and agreements with vendors relating to return privileges for certain products We also have a global sourcing operation to design develop test and contractmanufacture our exclusive brand products Store Development We had 1187 largeformat and 51 smallformat stores at the end of fiscal 2019 throughout our Domestic and International segments Our stores are a vital component of our multichannel strategy and we believe they are an important competitive advantage We have the ability to ship from all of our Best Buy stores in the US and all of our largeformat stores in Canada Customers may also elect to pick up orders initiated online in any of our stores Beginning in 2013 we opened vendor storewithinastore concepts to allow closer vendor partnerships and a higher quality customer experience In fiscal 2020 and beyond we will continue to look for opportunities to optimize our store space renegotiate leases and selectively open or close locations to support our operations Refer to Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for tables reconciling our Domestic and International segment stores open at the end of each of the last three fiscal years 5 Table of Contents Intellectual Property We own or have the right to use valuable intellectual property such as trademarks service marks and tradenames including but not limited to Best Buy Best Buy Express Best Buy Mobile Dynex Geek Squad GreatCall Insignia Jitterbug Lively Magnolia Modal My Best Buy Pacific Sales Pacific Kitchen and Home Platinum Rocketfish  5Star and our Yellow Tag logo We have secured domestic and international trademark and service mark registrations for many of our brands We have also secured patents for many of our inventions We believe our intellectual property has significant value and is an important factor in the marketing of our company our stores our products and our websites Seasonality Our business like that of many retailers is seasonal A large proportion of our revenue and earnings is generated in the fiscal fourth quarter which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season in the US Canada and Mexico Working Capital We fund our business operations through a combination of available cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and cash flows generated from operations In addition our revolving credit facilities are available for additional working capital needs for general corporate purposes and investment and growth opportunities Our working capital needs typically increase in the months leading up to the holiday shopping season as we purchase inventory in advance of expected sales Competition Our competitors are primarily multichannel retailers ecommerce businesses technology service providers traditional storebased retailers vendors and mobile network carriers who offer their products and services directly to customers We believe our ability to help customers online in stores and in their homes and to connect technology product and solutions with customer needs offers us key competitive advantages Some of our competitors have lower cost operating structures and seek to compete for sales primarily on price In the US onlineonly retailers historically were not generally required to collect sales taxes in certain states However a June 2018 Supreme Court decision  South Dakota v Wayfair  authorized states to require onlineonly retailers to collect and remit sales taxes As a result the onlineonly sales tax advantage of some of our competitors will continue to erode as more states require onlineonly retailers to collect sales tax We carefully monitor pricing offered by other retailers as maintaining price competitiveness is one of our ongoing priorities In addition we have pricematching policies that allow customers to request that we match a price offered by certain retail stores and online operators In order to allow this we are focused on maintaining efficient operations and leveraging the economies of scale available to us through our global vendor partnerships We believe our dedicated and knowledgeable people our integrated online retail and inhome assets our broad and curated product assortment our strong vendor partnerships our service and support offerings designed to solve real customer needs our unique ability to showcase technology in distinct store formats and our supply chain are important ways in which we maintain our competitive advantage Environmental and Social Matters We are an organization built upon valuesdriven leadership and focused on our purpose to enrich lives through technology We seek to apply our sense of corporate responsibility and focus on sustainable development to our interactions with all our stakeholders including our customers our employees our vendor partners our stockholders the community in which we operate and the environment Examples of such activities include the following For employees we expanded our benefits to include enhanced mental health coverage backup childcare caregiver leave and paid time off for parttime employees We reinforced our commitment to diversity and inclusion by signing the CEO Action for Diversity  Inclusion Pledge and the Parity Pledge We are committed to supporting teens from underserved communities by building brighter futures through technology training and mentorship The primary way we do this is through our network of Best Buy Teen Tech Centers which help prepare teens for careers in tech by providing them with opportunities to engage with the latest technology learn core professional skills and connect with Best Buy employee mentors We currently have 25 Teen Tech Centers and plan to reach 60 in total over the next few years We continuously look for solutions that minimize carbon emissions in our operations and have achieved a significant carbon reduction toward our goal of 60 percent by 2020 over a 2009 baseline from both operational reductions and renewable sourcing We also help our customers live more sustainably by assorting ENERGY STAR certified products which help them 6 Table of Contents save money on utility bills In addition we collected more than 180 million pounds of consumer electronics and appliances for recycling in fiscal 2019 Please refer to our Best Buy Corporate Responsibility  Sustainability Report on our website for further information on environmental and social performance Number of Employees At the end of fiscal 2019 we employed nearly 125000 fulltime parttime and seasonal employees in the US Canada and Mexico We offer our employees a wide array of companypaid benefits that vary within our company due to customary local practices and statutory requirements which we believe are competitive locally and in the aggregate relative to others in our industry Available Information We are subject to the

Risk Factors Described below are certain risks that we believe apply to our business and the industry in which we operate Each of the following risk factors should carefully be considered in conjunction with other information provided in this Annual Report on Form 10K and in our other public disclosures The risks described below highlight potential events trends or other circumstances that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows liquidity or access to sources of financing and consequently the market value of our common stock and debt instruments These risks could cause our future results to differ materially from historical results and from guidance we may provide regarding our expectations of future financial performance The risks described below are not an exhaustive list of all the risks we face There may be others that we have not identified or that we have deemed to be immaterial All forwardlooking statements made by us or on our behalf are qualified by the risks described below We face strong competition from multichannel retailers ecommerce businesses technology service providers traditional storebased retailers vendors and mobile network carriers which directly affects our revenue and profitability While we constantly strive to offer consumers the best value the retail sector is highly competitive Price is of great importance to most customers and price transparency and comparability continues to increase particularly as a result of digital technology The ability of consumers to compare prices on a realtime basis puts additional pressure on us to maintain competitive prices We compete with many other local regional national and international retailers and technology service providers as well as some of our vendors and mobile network carriers that market their products directly to consumers Competition may also result from new entrants into the markets we serve offering products andor services that compete with us The retail sector continues to experience a trend towards an increase in sales initiated online and using mobile applications and some onlineonly businesses have lower operating costs Online and multichannel retailers continue to focus on delivery services with customers increasingly seeking faster guaranteed delivery times and lowprice or free shipping Our ability to be 7 Table of Contents competitive on delivery times and delivery costs depends on many factors and our failure to successfully manage these factors and offer competitive delivery options could negatively impact the demand for our products and our profit margins Because our business strategy is based on offering superior levels of customer service and a full range of services to complement the products we offer our cost structure might be higher than some of our competitors and this in conjunction with price transparency could put pressure on our margins As these and related competitive factors evolve we may experience material adverse pressure on our revenue and profitability Our strategy to expand into new products services and technologies brings new business financial and regulatory risks As we introduce new products and services using new technologies and applications we may have limited experience in these newer market segments and our customers may not like our new value propositions These offerings may present new and difficult technology challenges and we may be subject to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions failures or other issues For example as our value proposition evolves to support the healthcare industry with technology we may be subject to privacy and information security rules such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act andor subject to increased potential liability risk This expanded risk increases the complexity of our business and places significant responsibility on our management employees operations systems technical expertise financial resources and internal financial and regulatory control and reporting functions In addition new initiatives we test through trials and pilots may not scale or grow effectively or as we expected which could limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results They may also involve significant laws or regulations that are beyond our current expertise As a part of our strategy to enrich lives through technology we are entering the health area growing organically as well as inorganically In fiscal 2019 we acquired GreatCall which provides emergency concierge and monitoring services to subscribed customers Such services might expose us to liability risk resulting from failures in the fulfillment of our services In addition the services and systems used could expose us to customer data information security as well as business or system interruption risks These and other related issues could have a material adverse impact on our financial results Our focus on services as a strategic priority exposes us to certain risks that could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability as well as our reputation We offer a full range of services that complement our product offerings including consultation delivery design installation memberships protection plans repair setup technical support and health safety and caregiving monitoring and support Designing marketing and executing these services is subject to incremental risks These risks include for example  increased labor expense to fulfill our customer promises which may be higher than the related revenue  increased risk of errors or omissions in the fulfillment of services  unpredictable extended warranty failure rates and related expenses  employees in transit using company vehicles to visit customer locations and employees being present in customer homes which may increase our scope of liability  the potential for increased scope of liability relating to managed services offerings  employees having access to customer devices including the information held on those devices which may increase our responsibility for the security of those devices and the data they hold  the engagement of third parties to assist with some aspects of construction and installation and the potential responsibility for the actions they withtake and for compliance with building codes and related regulations and  increased risk of noncompliance with new laws and regulations applicable to these services Our reliance on key vendors and mobile network carriers subjects us to various risks and uncertainties which could affect our revenue and profitability We source the products we sell from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors In fiscal 2019 our 20 largest suppliers accounted for approximately 64 of the merchandise we purchased 70 in fiscal 2018 with five suppliers  Apple Samsung HewlettPackard Sony and LG  representing approximately 51 of total merchandise purchased 56 in fiscal 2018 We generally do not have longterm written contracts with our vendors that would require them to continue supplying us with merchandise Our profitability depends on us securing acceptable terms with our vendors for among other things the price of merchandise we purchase from them funding for various forms of promotional programs payment terms allocations of merchandise development of compelling assortments of products operation of vendorfocused shopping experiences within our stores and terms covering returns and factory warranties While we believe we offer capabilities that these vendors value 8 Table of Contents and depend upon to varying degrees our vendors may be able to leverage their competitive advantages  for example their financial strength the strength of their brands with customers their own stores or online channels or their relationships with other retailers  to our commercial disadvantage The potential adverse impact of these factors can be amplified by price transparency which can limit our flexibility to modify selling prices and a highly competitive retail environment Generally our ability to negotiate favorable terms with our vendors is more difficult with vendors where our purchases represent a smaller proportion of their total revenues andor when there is less competition In addition vendors may decide to cease allowing us to offer certain categories focus their marketing efforts on alternative channels or make unfavorable changes to our commissions or other terms We are also dependent on a relatively small number of mobile carriers to allow us to offer mobile devices with carrier connections The competitive strategies utilized by mobile network carriers can have a material impact on our business especially with ongoing consolidation in the mobile industry For example if carriers change the structure of customer contracts customer upgrade terms customer qualification requirements monthly fee plans cancellation fees or service levels the volume of upgrades and new contracts we sign with customers may be reduced adversely affecting our revenue and profitability In addition our carriers also may serve customers through their own stores websites mobile applications and call centers or through other competing retail channels If we fail to attract retain and engage appropriately qualified employees including employees in key positions our operations and profitability may be harmed Changes in market compensation rates may adversely affect our profitability Our performance is highly dependent on attracting retaining and engaging appropriately qualified employees in our stores service centers distribution centers field and corporate offices Our strategy of offering highquality services and assistance for our customers requires a highly trained and engaged workforce The turnover rate in the retail sector is relatively high and there is an ongoing need to recruit and train new employees Factors that affect our ability to maintain sufficient numbers of qualified employees include employee morale our reputation unemployment rates competition from other employers availability of qualified personnel and our ability to offer appropriate compensation and benefit packages Failure to recruit or retain qualified employees in the future may impair our efficiency and effectiveness and our ability to pursue growth opportunities In addition a significant amount of turnover of our executive team or other employees in key positions with specific knowledge relating to us our operations and our industry may negatively impact our operations We operate in a competitive labor market and there is a risk that market increases in compensation could have a material adverse effect on our profitability Market increases to field employee hourly wage rates along with our ability to implement corresponding adjustments within our labor model and wage rates could have a material impact to the profitability of our business We are subject to certain statutory regulatory and legal developments which could have a material adverse impact on our business Our statutory regulatory and legal environments expose us to complex compliance and litigation risks that could have a material adverse effect on our operations Some of the most significant compliance and litigation risks we face are  the difficulty of complying with sometimes conflicting statutes and regulations in local national or international jurisdictions  the potential for unexpected costs related to compliance with new or existing environmental legislation or international agreements affecting energy carbon emissions electronics recycling and water or product materials  ensuring compliance with applicable product compliance laws and regulations with respect to both the products we sell and contract to manufacture including laws and regulations related to product safety and product transport  the financial operational and business impact of new regulations governing data privacy and security such as the California Consumer Privacy Act CCPA When it goes into effect on January 1 2020 the regulation will provide new consumer data privacy rights for California residents and will require companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers allowing them to optout of certain uses of their personal information However legislators have stated that they intend to propose amendments to the CCPA and it remains unclear what if any modifications will be made to the CCPA or how it will be interpreted We cannot yet predict the impact of the CCPA on our business or operations but it may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and incur incremental expenses in an effort to comply  the impact of other new or changing statutes and regulations including but not limited to financial reform National Labor Relations Board rule changes healthcare reform corporate governance matters escheatment rules rules governing pricing content distribution copyright mobile communications electronic device certification or payment 9 Table of Contents services andor other as yet unknown legislation that could affect how we operate and execute our strategies as well as alter our expense structure  the impact of the potential implementation of more restrictive trade policies higher tariffs or the renegotiation of existing trade agreements in the US or countries where we sell our products and services or procure products  the impact of potential changes in US or other countries tax laws and regulations or evolving interpretations of existing laws including additional guidance and legislation related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and  the impact of litigation trends including class action lawsuits involving consumers and shareholders and labor and employment matters Regulatory activity focused on the retail sector has grown in recent years increasing the risk of fines and additional operating costs associated with compliance Additionally defending against lawsuits and other proceedings may involve significant expense and divert managements attention and resources from other matters Macroeconomic pressures in the markets in which we operate could adversely affect consumer spending and our financial results To varying degrees our products and services are sensitive to changes in macroeconomic conditions that impact consumer spending As a result consumers may be affected in many different ways including for example  whether or not they make a purchase  their choice of brand model or pricepoint  how frequently they upgrade or replace their devices and  their appetite for complementary services for example protection plans Real GDP growth consumer confidence inflation employment levels oil prices interest rates tax rates availability of consumer financing housing market conditions foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations costs for items such as fuel and food and other macroeconomic trends can adversely affect consumer demand for the products and services that we offer Geopolitical issues around the world and how our markets are positioned might also impact the macroeconomic conditions and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results Failure to effectively manage our costs could have a material adverse effect on our profitability As discussed above our revenues are susceptible to volatility from various sources which can lead to periods of flat or declining revenues However some of our operating costs are fixed andor are subject to multiyear contracts Some elements of our costs may be higher than our competitors because of for example our extended retail footprint and structure our differential service offerings or our levels of customer service Accordingly our ongoing drive to reduce costs and increase efficiency represents a strategic imperative Failure to successfully manage our costs could have a material adverse impact on our profitability and curtail our ability to fund our growth or other critical initiatives We rely heavily on our information technology systems for our key business processes Any failure or interruption in these systems could have a material adverse impact on our business The effective and efficient operation of our business is dependent on our information technology systems and those of our information technology vendors We rely heavily on these information technology systems to manage all key aspects of our business including demand forecasting purchasing supply chain management pointofsale processing services fulfillment staff planning and deployment financial management reporting and forecasting and safeguarding critical and sensitive information Our information technology systems and those of our partners are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses worms other malicious computer programs denialofservice attacks security breaches through cyberattacks and other malicious actions catastrophic events such as fires tornadoes earthquakes and hurricanes and usage errors by our employees The failure or interruption of these information systems data centers or their backup systems could significantly disrupt our business and cause higher costs and lost revenues and could threaten our ability to remain in operation We also utilize complex information technology platforms to operate our websites and mobile applications If we fail to secure these systems against attacks or fail to effectively upgrade and maintain our hardware software network and system infrastructure and improve the efficiency and resiliency of our systems it could cause system interruptions and delays Disruptions to these services such as those caused by unforeseen traffic levels malicious attacks other technical difficulties or 10 Table of Contents events outside of our control such as natural disasters power or telecommunications failures or loss of critical data could prevent us from accepting and fulfilling customer orders for products or services which could cause us to forgo material revenues incur material costs and adversely affect our reputation Failure to prevent or effectively respond to a breach of the privacy or security of our customer employee vendor or company information could expose us to substantial costs and reputational damage as well as litigation and enforcement actions Our business involves the collection use and storage of customer information including payment card information as well as confidential information regarding our employees vendors and other company information We also share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties as well as use thirdparty technology and systems which transmit customer information for a variety of activities While we take significant steps to protect this information external criminal activity such as cyberattacks lapses in our controls or the intentional or negligent actions of employees business associates or third parties may undermine our privacy and security measures and unauthorized parties may obtain access to our data systems and misappropriate employee customer and other confidential data Furthermore because the methods used to obtain unauthorized access change frequently and may not be immediately detected we may be unable to anticipate such attacks or promptly and effectively respond to them Any compromise of our customer information or other confidential information could have a material adverse effect on our reputation or our relationships with our customers and partners which may in turn have a negative impact on our revenue and may expose us to material costs penalties and claims Sensitive customer data may also be present on customerowned devices entrusted to us for service and repair Vulnerable code on products sold or serviced including our exclusive brands may also result in a compromise of customer privacy or security Our efforts to protect against such compromises and ensure appropriate handling of customer data on devices we manufacture sell and service may not be effective resulting in potential liability and damage to our customer relationships Increasing costs associated with information security and customer data privacy such as increased investment in technology and qualified staff costs of compliance costs resulting from fraud and costs of cyber and privacy insurance could cause our business and results of operations to suffer materially Additionally new laws like the General Data Protection Regulation and CCPA are expanding company obligations to protect the privacy of customer data requiring additional resources and creating incremental risk of potential breach In addition any compromise of our data security may materially increase the costs we incur to protect against such breaches and could subject us to additional legal risk Failure to effectively manage strategic ventures alliances or acquisitions could have a negative impact on our business We may decide to enter into new joint ventures partnerships alliances or acquisitions with third parties collectively new ventures Assessing the viability of new ventures is typically subject to significant uncertainty and the success of such new ventures can be adversely affected by many factors including for example  different and incremental business risks of the new venture  failure to motivate and retain key employees of the new venture  uncertainty of forecasting financial performance  failure to integrate aspects of the new venture into our existing business such as new product or service offerings or information technology systems  failure to maintain appropriate internal control over financial reporting  failure to generate expected synergies such as cost reductions  unforeseen changes in the business environment of the new venture  disputes or strategic differences with other thirdparty participants in the new venture and  adverse impacts on relationships with vendors and other key partners of our existing business or the new venture If new ventures are unsuccessful our liquidity and profitability could be materially adversely affected and we may be required to recognize material impairments to goodwill and other assets acquired New ventures may also divert our financial resources and managements attention from other important areas of our business We are highly dependent on the cash flows and net earnings we generate during our fourth fiscal quarter which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season A large proportion of our revenue and earnings is generated in the fiscal fourth quarter which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season in the US Canada and Mexico In addition the holiday shopping season also incorporates many other unpredictable factors such as the level of competitive promotional activity and customer buying patterns which makes it 11 Table of Contents difficult to forecast and react to these factors quickly Unexpected events or developments such as natural or manmade disasters changes in consumer demand economic factors product sourcing issues cyberattacks failure or interruption of management information systems or disruptions in services or systems provided or managed by thirdparty vendors could significantly disrupt our operations As a result of these factors there is a risk that our fourth quarter and annual results could be adversely affected Many of the products we sell are highly susceptible to technological advancement product life cycle fluctuations and changes in consumer preferences We operate in a highly and increasingly dynamic industry sector fueled by constant technology innovation and disruption This manifests itself in a variety of ways emergence of new products and categories rapid maturation of categories cannibalization of categories declining price points and product replacement and upgrade cycles This rapid pace of change can be hard to predict and manage and there is no guarantee we can effectively do this all the time If we fail to interpret predict and react to these changes in a timely and effective manner the consequences can include failure to offer the products and services that our customers want having excess inventory which may require heavy discounting or liquidation inability to secure adequate access to brands or products for which consumer demand exceeds supply delays in adapting our merchandising marketing or supply chain capabilities to accommodate changes in product trends and damage to our brand and reputation These and other similar factors could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability Economic regulatory and other developments could adversely affect our ability to offer attractive promotional financing to our customers and adversely affect the profits we generate from these programs We offer promotional financing and credit cards issued by thirdparty banks that manage and directly extend credit to our customers Customers choosing promotional financing can receive extended payment terms and low or nointerest financing on qualifying purchases We believe our financing programs generate incremental revenue from customers who prefer the financing terms to other available forms of payment or otherwise need access to financing in order to make purchases Approximately 25 of our fiscal 2019 revenue was transacted using one of the companys branded cards In addition we earn profitshare income and share in any losses from certain of our banking partners based on the performance of the programs The income or loss we earn in this regard is subject to numerous factors including the volume and value of transactions the terms of promotional financing offers bad debt rates interest rates the regulatory and competitive environment and expenses of operating the program Adverse changes to any of these factors could impair our ability to offer these programs to customers and reduce customer purchases and our ability to earn income from sharing in the profits or losses of the programs Interruptions and other factors affecting our supply chain including inbound deliveries from our vendors may adversely affect our business Our supply chain is a critical part of our operations particularly in light of industry trends and initiatives such as shipfromstore and the emphasis on fast delivery when purchasing online We depend on our vendors abilities to deliver products to us at the right location right time and in the right quantities We also depend on third parties for the operation of certain aspects of our supply chain network The factors that can adversely affect these aspects of our operations include  interruptions to our delivery capabilities  failure of third parties to meet our standards or commitments  disruptions to our systems and the need to implement new systems  limitations in capacity  consolidation or business failures in the transportation and distribution sectors  labor strikes or slowdowns impacting ports or any other aspect of our supply chain  damages or other loss to products and  increasing transportation costs It is important that we maintain optimal levels of inventory in each store and distribution center and respond rapidly to shifting demands Any disruption to or inefficiency in our supply chain network could damage our revenue and profitability The risks associated with our dependence on third parties are greater for small parcel home deliveries because of the relatively small number of carriers with the scope and capacity required by our business The continuing growth of online purchases for delivery increases our exposure to these risks If we fail to manage these risks effectively we could experience a material adverse impact on our reputation revenue and profitability 12 Table of Contents Catastrophic events could adversely affect our operating results The risk or actual occurrence of various catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance Such events may be caused by for example  natural disasters or extreme weather events  diseases or epidemics that may affect our employees customers or partners  floods fires or other catastrophes affecting our properties or  terrorism civil unrest or other conflicts In recent years we have observed an increase in the number and severity of certain events in many of our markets Such events can adversely affect our work force and prevent employees and customers from reaching our stores and properties and can disrupt or disable portions of our supply chain and distribution network They can also affect our information technology systems resulting in disruption to various aspects of our operations including our ability to transact with customers and fulfill orders As a consequence of these or other catastrophic events we may endure interruption to our operations or losses of property equipment or inventory which would adversely affect our revenue and profitability Demand for the products and services we sell could decline if we fail to maintain positive brand perception and recognition We operate a portfolio of brands with a commitment to customer service and innovation We believe that recognition and the reputation of our company and our brands are key to our success Operational factors such as for example failure to deliver high quality services uncompetitive pricing failure to meet delivery promises or business interruptions could damage our reputation External factors such as negative public remarks or accusations could also be damaging The ubiquity of social media means that customer feedback and other information about our company are shared with a broad audience in a manner that is easily accessible and rapidly disseminated Damage to the perception or reputation of our brands could result in among other things declines in revenues and customer loyalty decreases in gift card and service plan sales lower employee retention and productivity and vendor relationship issues all of which could materially adversely affect our revenue and profitability Product safety and quality concerns could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability If the products we sell fail to meet applicable safety standards or our customers expectations regarding safety and quality we could be exposed to increased legal risk and our reputation may be damaged Failure to take appropriate actions in relation to product recalls could lead to breaches of laws and regulations and leave us susceptible to government enforcement actions or private litigation Recalls of products particularly when combined with lack of available alternatives or our difficulty in sourcing sufficient volumes of replacement products could also have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability Changes to labor or employment laws or regulations could have an adverse impact on our costs and impair the viability of our operating model As an employer of nearly 125000 people in a large number of different jurisdictions we are subject to risks related to employment laws and regulations including for example  the organization of unions and related regulations that affect the nature of labor relations changes to which the National Labor Relations Board continually considers  laws that impact the relationship between the company and independent contractors and  laws that impact minimum wage sick time paid leave and scheduling requirements could directly or indirectly increase our payroll costs andor impact the level of service we are able to provide Changes to laws and regulations such as these could adversely impact our reputation our ability to continue operations and our profitability In addition although as of February 2 2019 none of our US operations had employees represented by labor unions or working under collective bargaining agreements any future organizing activity could adversely affect our costs and our results of operations 13 Table of Contents Failure to effectively manage our real estate portfolio may negatively impact our operating results Effective management of our real estate portfolio is critical to our multichannel strategy Failure to identify and secure suitable locations for our stores and other facilities could impair our ability to compete successfully and our profitability Most of our properties are leased of which some are subject to longterm leases As such it is essential that we effectively evaluate a range of factors that may influence the success of our longterm real estate strategy Such factors include for example  changing patterns of customer consumption and behavior particularly in light of an evolving multichannel environment  the location and appropriate number of stores in our portfolio  the interior layout format and size of our stores  the products and services we offer at each store  the local competitive positioning trade area demographics and economic factors for each of our stores  the primary term lease commitment and longterm lease option coverage for each store  the occupancy cost of our stores relative to market rents and  our supply chain service location network strategy If we fail to effectively evaluate these factors or negotiate appropriate terms or if unforeseen changes arise the consequences could include for example  closing stores and abandoning the related assets while retaining the financial commitments of the leases  incurring significant costs to remodel or transform our stores  operating stores supply chain or service locations that no longer meet the needs of our business and  bearing excessive lease expenses These consequences could have a material adverse impact on our profitability cash flows and liquidity For leased property the financial impact of exiting a location can vary greatly depending on among other factors the terms of the lease the condition of the local real estate market demand for the specific property our relationship with the landlord and the availability of potential sublease tenants It is difficult for us to influence some of these factors and the costs of exiting a property can be significant In addition to rent we are still responsible for taxes insurance and common area maintenance charges for vacant properties until the lease commitment expires or is terminated Similarly when we enter into a contract with a tenant to sublease property we usually retain our obligations as the master lessee This leaves us at risk for any remaining liability in the event of default by the sublease tenant Constraints in the capital markets or our vendor credit terms may have a material adverse impact on our liquidity We need sufficient sources of liquidity to fund our working capital requirements service our outstanding indebtedness and finance business opportunities Without sufficient liquidity we could be forced to curtail our operations or we may not be able to pursue business opportunities The principal sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operating activities available cash and liquid investments credit facilities other debt arrangements and trade payables Our liquidity could be materially adversely impacted if our vendors reduce payment terms andor impose tighter credit limits If our sources of liquidity do not satisfy our requirements we may need to seek additional financing The future availability of financing will depend on a variety of factors such as economic and market conditions the regulatory environment for banks and other financial institutions the availability of credit our credit ratings and our reputation with potential lenders These factors could have a material adverse effect on our costs of borrowing our ability to pursue business opportunities and threaten our ability to meet our obligations as they become due Changes in our credit ratings may limit our access to capital and materially increase our borrowing costs Any future downgrades to our credit ratings and outlook could negatively impact the perception of our credit risk and thus our access to capital markets borrowing costs vendor terms and lease terms Our credit ratings are based upon information furnished by us or obtained by a rating agency from its own sources and are subject to revision suspension or withdrawal by one or more rating agencies at any time Rating agencies may change the ratings assigned to us due to developments that are beyond our control including the introduction of new rating practices and methodologies 14 Table of Contents We utilize thirdparty vendors for certain aspects of our operations and any material disruption in our relationship or their services might have an impact to our business We engage key thirdparty business partners to support various functions of our business including but not limited to information technology web hosting and cloudbased services human resource operations customer loyalty programs promotional financing and customer loyalty credit cards gift cards customer warranty delivery and installation technical support transportation and insurance

legal risks that could affect our operating results Sales of our exclusive brands products which include Dynex Insignia Modal Platinum and Rocketfish branded products represent an important component of our product offerings and our revenue and profitability Most of these products are manufactured by contract manufacturers based in southeast Asia This arrangement exposes us to the following additional potential risks which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  we have greater exposure and responsibility to consumers for warranty replacements and repairs as a result of exclusive brand product defects and our recourse to contract manufacturers for such warranty liabilities may be limited in foreign jurisdictions  we may be subject to regulatory compliance andor product liability claims relating to personal injury death or property damage caused by exclusive brand products some of which may require us to take significant actions such as product recalls  we may experience disruptions in manufacturing or logistics due to inconsistent and unanticipated order patterns our inability to develop longterm relationships with key manufacturers or unforeseen natural disasters  we may not be able to locate manufacturers that meet our internal standards whether for new exclusive brand products or for migration of the manufacturing of products from an existing manufacturer  we may be subject to a greater risk of inventory obsolescence as we do not generally have return to vendor rights  we are subject to developing and oftenchanging labor and environmental laws for the manufacture of products in foreign countries and we may be unable to conform to new rules or interpretations in a timely manner  we may be subject to claims by technology or other intellectual property owners if we inadvertently infringe upon their patents or other intellectual property rights or if we fail to pay royalties owed on our exclusive brand products  our operations may be disrupted by trade disputes or excessive tariffs and we may not be able to source alternatives quickly enough to avoid interruptions in product supply  we may be unable to obtain or adequately protect patents and other intellectual property rights on our exclusive brand products or manufacturing processes and  regulations regarding disclosure of efforts to identify the country of origin of conflict minerals in certain portions of our supply chain could increase the cost of doing business and depending on the findings of our country of origin inquiry could have an adverse effect on our reputation Maintaining consistent quality availability and competitive pricing of our exclusive brand products helps us build and maintain customer loyalty generate revenue and achieve acceptable margins Failure to maintain these factors could have a significant adverse impact on the demand for exclusive brand products and the profits we are able to generate from them We are subject to risks associated with vendors that source products outside of the US Our ability to find qualified vendors who can supply products in a timely and efficient manner that meet our internal standards of quality and safety can be difficult especially with respect to goods sourced from outside the US Risks such as political or economic instability crossborder trade restrictions or tariffs merchandise quality issues product safety concerns work stoppages port delays foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations transportation capacity and costs inflation civil unrest natural disasters outbreaks of pandemics and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control Vendors may also fail to invest adequately in design production or distribution facilities and may reduce their customer incentives advertising and promotional activities or change their pricing policies These and other related issues could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 15 Table

terrorism  economic conditions including monetary and fiscal policies and tax rules as well as foreign exchange rate risk  rules governing international trade and potential changes to trade policies or trade agreements and ownership of foreign entities  cultural differences that we may be unable to anticipate or respond to appropriately  different rules or practices regarding employee relations including the existence of works councils or unions  difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights and  difficulties encountered in exerting appropriate management oversight to operations in remote locations These factors could significantly disrupt our International operations and have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability and could lead us to incur material impairments and other exit costs Failure to meet the financial performance guidance or other forwardlooking statements we have provided to the public could result in a decline in our stock price We may provide public guidance on our expected financial results or other forwardlooking information for future periods Although we believe that this guidance provides investors and analysts with a
