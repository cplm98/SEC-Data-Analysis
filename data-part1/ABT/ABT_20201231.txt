and product potential for overall costeffectiveness and productivity gains Some products in this segment can be subject to rapid product obsolescence or regulatory changes Although Abbott has benefited from technological advantages of certain of its current products these advantages may be reduced or eliminated as competitors introduce new products INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO ABBOTTS BUSINESS IN GENERAL Sources and Availability of Raw Materials Abbott purchases in the ordinary course of business raw materials and supplies essential to Abbotts operations from numerous suppliers in the United States and around the world There have been no recent significant availability problems or supply shortages for raw materials or supplies Patents Trademarks and Licenses Abbott is aware of the desirability for patent and trademark protection for its products Accordingly where possible patents and trademarks are sought and obtained for Abbotts products in the United States and countries of interest to Abbott Abbott owns or has licenses under a substantial number of patents and patent applications Principal trademarks and the products they cover are discussed in the Narrative Description of Business on pages 1 through 4 These and various patents which expire during the period 2021 to 2041 in the aggregate are believed to be of material importance in the operation of Abbotts business Abbott believes that no single patent license or trademark is material in relation to Abbotts business as a whole Seasonal Aspects Customers and Renegotiation There are no significant seasonal aspects to Abbotts business Abbott has no single customer that if the customer were lost would have a material adverse effect on Abbott No material portion of Abbotts business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of a government Environmental Matters Abbott believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection Regulations under federal and state environmental laws impose stringent limitations on emissions and discharges to the environment from various manufacturing operations Abbotts capital and operating expenditures for pollution control in 2020 were not material and are not expected to be material in 2021 Abbott has been identified as one of many potentially responsible parties in investigations andor remediations at several locations in the United States including Puerto Rico under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act commonly known as Superfund Abbott is also engaged in remediation at several other sites some of which are owned by Abbott in cooperation with the Environmental Protection Agency or similar agencies While it is not feasible to predict with certainty the final costs related to those investigations and remediation activities Abbott believes that such costs together with other expenditures to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection should not have a material adverse effect on Abbotts financial position cash flows or results of operations Human Capital The sustainability of Abbotts business depends on attracting engaging and developing talented people with diverse backgrounds who share Abbotts mission to help people live their healthiest possible lives Abbott provides its employees opportunities to grow and develop their careers market competitive compensation and benefit programs and the satisfaction of being part of a global company dedicated to improving health in more than 160 countries 4 As of December 31 2020 Abbott employed approximately 109000 people 70 of whom were employed outside of the US Women represented 47 of Abbotts US workforce 45 of its global workforce and 39 of its managers Health and Safety The health safety and wellness of its employees is an Abbott priority embedded at every level of its business Abbotts integrated Environmental Health and Safety organization governs health safety and wellness at Abbotts facilities Abbott also maintains global policies and standards for managing employee health and safety Abbott takes a holistic approach to employee wellbeing Abbotts global wellness programs are designed to meet the unique needs of employees across businesses and geographies and offer a wide range of programs including supporting the mental financial and physical health of employees and their families For example for over 20 years Abbott has annually offered Exercise Across Abbott which is a fourweek physical wellness program that encourages employees to team up with colleagues and track how many minutes they exercise each day Over 22000 Abbott employees across 72 countries took part in 2020 During the COVID19 pandemic Abbott has taken aggressive steps to limit exposure and enhance the safety of facilities for its employees including implementing mandatory temperature screening and social distancing providing and requiring the use of personal protective equipment and at most US facilities onsite COVID19 testing Talent Management Abbott has an integrated global talent management process that is designed to identify and assess talent across the organization and provide equal and consistent opportunities for employees to develop their skills All levels of employees participate in Abbotts annual performance management process to create development plans that support their particular career objectives and Abbott provides a broad range of training mentoring and other development opportunities to help its employees meet these objectives The board of directors conducts an annual Talent Management Review focusing on development of talent diversity and succession planning for critical positions Similar reviews take place at every level of Abbott to develop talent and diversity across the organization Diversity and Inclusion Abbott is committed to developing a workplace that is inclusive for all Abbott ties executive compensation to human capital management including diversity outcomes to sustain an inclusive culture and the fair and balanced treatment of Abbotts employees Abbotts employee networks play an important role in building an inclusive culture across all Abbott operations A member of Abbotts senior management serves as a sponsor for each of these networks helping to align their objectives with Abbotts business strategies Abbott has ten such networks which are Advancing Professionals Network supporting early career employees Asian Leadership and Cultural Network Black Business Network Flex Network employees with parttime and flexible schedules LA VOICE Network supporting Hispanic and Latino employees People with Disabilities Network PRIDE supporting LGBTQ employees Veterans Network Women Leaders of Abbott and Women in STEM Abbott offers professional development programs which provide recent college graduates the opportunity to rotate through different areas of Abbott often with the chance to work outside their home country In 2020 52 of the participants were women Also Abbott hosts hundreds of college students for paid internships In 2020 55 of the US interns were women and 39 were minorities Further Abbott has operated a STEM internship program for high school students in the US since 2012 The programs objective is to increase the number of students pursuing STEMrelated careers and contribute to a more diverse talent pipeline for Abbott In 2020 58 of the STEM interns were women and 71 were minorities 5 Compensation and Benefits Abbott is committed to building retaining and motivating a diverse talent pipeline that can meet the current and future needs of its businesses To that end Abbott provides market competitive compensation healthcare benefits pension andor retirement savings plans and several programs to facilitate employees building an ownership stake in Abbott including a global longterm incentive program for employees generally beginning at the manager level Abbott also has procedures and processes focused on providing employees equitable compensation regardless of race or gender or other personal characteristics Regulation The development manufacture marketing sale promotion and distribution of Abbotts products are subject to comprehensive government regulation by the US Food and Drug Administration FDA and similar international regulatory agencies Government regulation by various international supranational federal and state agencies addresses among other matters the development and approval to market Abbotts products as well as the inspection of and controls over research and laboratory procedures clinical investigations product approvals and manufacturing labeling packaging supply chains marketing and promotion pricing and reimbursement sampling distribution quality control postmarket surveillance record keeping storage and disposal practices In addition Abbotts clinical laboratories and associated testing services are subject to comprehensive government regulation including registration certification and licensure by federal state and local agencies such as the Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services the Drug Enforcement Administration the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and their respective foreign counterparts Certain of these agencies require our clinical laboratories to meet quality assurance quality control and personnel standards and undergo inspections During the COVID19 public health emergency many pandemicrelated products including diagnostic tests were authorized by regulators for emergency use solely during the pandemic In addition many governments enacted policies to expedite or promote access to health care in order to slow or stop the spread of the virus Examples include expansion of telehealth coverages and increased reimbursements for diagnostic testing It is uncertain when the public health emergency will end and to what extent these policies will continue or revert back to previous policies Abbotts international operations are also affected by trade and investment regulations in many countries These may require local investment restrict Abbotts investments or limit the import of raw materials and finished products Abbotts laboratory facilities and home monitoring services which provide services related products and medical devices to consumers are subject to additional laws and regulations applicable to health care providers and suppliers that submit claims for reimbursement to thirdparty payors In the United States Medicare Medicaid and other thirdparty payors may from time to time conduct inquiries claims audits investigations and enforcement actions relating to the claims or enrollment criteria Abbott is subject to laws and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse including state and federal antikickback antiselfreferral and false claims laws in the United States Prescription drug nutrition and medical device manufacturers such as Abbott are also subject to taxes as well as application product user establishment and other fees Governmental agencies can also invalidate intellectual property rights Compliance with these laws and regulations is costly and materially affects Abbotts business Among other effects health care regulations and significant changes thereto such as the introduction of the Medical Device Regulation and the In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Device Regulation in the European Union substantially increase the time difficulty and costs incurred in developing obtaining and maintaining approval to market and marketing newly developed and existing products Abbott expects this regulatory environment will continue to require significant technical expertise and investment to ensure compliance Failure to comply can delay the release of a new product or result in regulatory and enforcement actions the seizure or recall of a product the suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for a products production and sale suspension or revocation of billing privileges and other civil or criminal sanctions including fines and penalties Similarly compliance with the laws and regulations governing clinical laboratories and testing services requires specialized expertise Failure to comply with these regulatory requirements can result in sanctions including suspension revocation or limitation of a laboratorys certification which is necessary to conduct business as well as significant fines or criminal penalties 6 Abbotts business can also be affected by ongoing studies of the utilization safety efficacy and outcomes of health care products and their components that are regularly conducted by industry participants government agencies and others These studies can call into question the utilization safety and efficacy of previously marketed products In some cases these studies have resulted and may in the future result in the discontinuation of marketing of such products in one or more countries and may give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of their use Access to human health care products continues to be a subject of investigation and action by governmental agencies legislative bodies and private organizations in many countries A major focus is cost containment Efforts to reduce health care costs are also being made in the private sector notably by health care payors and providers which have instituted various cost reduction and containment measures Abbott expects insurers and providers will continue attempts to reduce the cost or utilization of health care products Many countries control the price of health care products directly or indirectly through reimbursement payment pricing or coverage limitations Budgetary pressures on health care payors may also heighten the scope and severity of pricing pressures on Abbotts products for the foreseeable future In the United States the federal government regularly evaluates reimbursement for medical devices diagnostics supplies and other products as well as the procedures in which these products may be used The government follows a diagnosisrelated group DRG payment system for certain institutional services provided under Medicare or Medicaid and has implemented a prospective payment system PPS for services delivered in hospital outpatient nursing home and home health settings DRG and PPS entitle a health care facility to a fixed reimbursement based on the diagnosis andor procedure rather than actual costs incurred in patient treatment thereby increasing the incentive for the facility to limit or control expenditures for many health care products Other payment methodology changes have been proposed and implemented from time to time For example Medicare implemented a competitive bidding system for certain durable medical equipment including diabetes products enteral nutrition products and supplies Additionally the Protecting Access to Medicare Act established a new payment system for clinical laboratory tests in 2018 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act the Affordable Care Act includes provisions known as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act which requires manufacturers of drugs devices and medical supplies covered under Medicare and Medicaid to record any transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and to report this data to the Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services for subsequent public disclosure In October 2018 the Substance Use Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act significantly expanded the types of healthcare providers for which reporting is required beginning with reports filed in 2022 Similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level domestically and an increasing number of governments worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring transparency of interactions with health care professionals Failure to report appropriate data may result in civil or criminal fines andor penalties Policy changes or implementation of new health care legislation could result in significant changes to health care systems In the United States this could include potential modification including expansion or repeal of all or parts of the Affordable Care Act The regulation of data privacy and security and the protection of the confidentiality of certain personal information including patient health information financial information and other sensitive personal information is increasing For example the European Union various other countries and various US states eg California have enacted stricter data protection laws that contain enhanced financial penalties for noncompliance Similarly the US Department of Health and Human Services has issued rules governing the use disclosure and security of protected health information and the FDA has issued further guidance concerning cybersecurity for medical devices In addition certain countries have issued or are considering data localization laws which limit companies ability to transfer protected data across country borders Failure to comply with data privacy and security laws and regulations can result in business disruption and enforcement actions which could include civil or criminal penalties Transferring and managing protected information will become more challenging as laws and regulations are enacted or amended and Abbott expects there will be increasing complexity in this area Governmental cost containment efforts also affect Abbotts nutritional products business In the United States for example under regulations governing the federally funded Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women Infants and Children all states must have a cost containment program for infant formula As a result through competitive bidding states obtain rebates from manufacturers of infant formula whose products are used in the program 7 Abbott expects debate to continue at all government levels worldwide over the manufacture quality assurance requirements marketing authorization processes postmarket surveillance requirements availability method of delivery and payment for health care products and services as well as data privacy and security Abbott believes that future legislation and regulation in the markets it serves could affect the timing and expense associated with bringing health care products or services to market access to health care products and services increase rebates reduce prices or reimbursements or the rate of price increases for health care products and services change health care delivery systems create new fees and obligations for the pharmaceutical nutrition diagnostic and medical device industries or require additional reporting and disclosure It is not possible to predict the extent to which Abbott or the health care industry in general might be affected by the matters discussed above INTERNET INFORMATION Copies of Abbotts Annual Report on Form 10K Quarterly Reports on Form 10Q Current Reports on Form 8K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section

following risk factors should be considered before deciding to invest in any of Abbotts securities Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to Abbott or risks Abbott currently considers immaterial could also affect Abbotts actual results Abbotts business financial condition results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks Business and Operational Risks Abbott may acquire other businesses license rights to technologies or products form alliances or dispose of or spinoff businesses which could cause it to incur significant expenses and could negatively affect profitability Abbott may pursue acquisitions licensing arrangements and strategic alliances or dispose of or spinoff some of its businesses as part of its business strategy Abbott may not complete these transactions in a timely manner on a costeffective basis or at all and may not realize the expected benefits If Abbott is successful in making an acquisition the products and technologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated Abbott may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into its existing business or transition disposed businesses efficiently and could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities Abbott could also experience negative effects on its reported results of operations from acquisition or dispositionrelated charges amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges for impairment of longterm assets These effects could cause a deterioration of Abbotts credit rating result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense and decrease liquidity Abbott depends on sophisticated information technology systems and maintains protected personal data and a cyber attack or other breach affecting these information technology systems or protected data could have a material adverse effect on Abbotts results of operations Similar to other large multinational companies the size and complexity of the information technology systems on which Abbott relies for both its infrastructure and products makes them susceptible to a cyber attack malicious intrusion breakdown destruction loss of data privacy or other significant disruption These systems have been and are expected to continue to be the target of malware and other cyber attacks In addition third party hacking attempts may cause Abbotts information technology systems and related products protected data or proprietary information to be compromised or stolen A significant attack or other disruption could result in adverse consequences including increased costs and expenses manufacturing challenges or disruption problems with product functionality damage to customer relations lost revenue and legal or regulatory penalties Abbott also collects manages and processes protected personal data including protected health information in connection with certain medical products and service offerings Abbott is subject to certain regional and local data protection laws that prohibit or restrict the transfer of protected data across country borders For additional information concerning data privacy and security regulation see the discussion in Regulation under Item 1 Business A breach of protected personal information could result in adverse consequences including regulatory inquiries or litigation increased costs and expenses reputational damage lost revenue and fines or penalties Abbott invests in its systems and technology and in the protection of its products and data to reduce the risk of an attack or other significant disruption and monitors its systems on an ongoing basis for any current or potential threats and for changes in technology and the regulatory environment There can be no assurance that these measures and efforts will prevent future attacks or other significant disruptions to any of the systems on which Abbott relies or that related product issues will not arise in the future Similarly there can be no assurance that third party information technology providers with whom Abbott contracts will not suffer a significant attack or disruption that impacts customers like Abbott Any significant breach attack or other disruption involving Abbotts systems or products could have a material adverse effect on Abbotts business 9 Abbotts research and development efforts may not succeed in developing commercially successful products and technologies which may cause Abbotts revenue and profitability to decline To remain competitive Abbott must continue to launch new products and technologies To accomplish this Abbott commits substantial efforts funds and other resources to research and development A risk of failure is inherent in the research and development of new products and technologies Abbott must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful Failure can occur at any point in the process including after significant funds have been invested Promising new products and technologies may fail to reach the market or may only have limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns failure to achieve positive clinical outcomes inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals limited scope of approved uses excessive costs to manufacture failure to establish or maintain intellectual property rights or infringement of the intellectual property rights of others Even if Abbott successfully develops new products or enhancements or new generations of Abbotts existing products they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences changing industry or regulatory standards or competitors innovations Innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of among other things entrenched patterns of clinical practice or uncertainty over thirdparty reimbursement Abbott cannot state with certainty when or whether any of its products under development will be launched whether it will be able to develop license or otherwise acquire compounds or products or whether any products will be commercially successful Failure to launch successful new products or technologies or new indications or uses for existing products may cause Abbotts products or technologies to become obsolete causing Abbotts revenues and operating results to suffer The manufacture of many of Abbotts products is a highly exacting and complex process and if Abbott or one of its suppliers encounters problems manufacturing products Abbotts business could suffer The manufacture of many of Abbotts products is a highly exacting and complex process due in part to strict regulatory requirements Problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons including equipment malfunction failure to follow specific protocols and procedures problems with raw materials natural disasters and environmental factors In addition single suppliers are currently used for certain products and materials If problems arise during the production of a lot or batch of product those products may have to be discarded If problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market recall and product liability costs may also be incurred Any of these events could among other things lead to increased costs lost revenue damage to customer relations time and expense spent investigating the cause and depending on the cause similar losses with respect to other lots batches or products To the extent Abbott or one of its suppliers experiences significant manufacturing problems this could have a material adverse effect on Abbotts revenues and profitability Abbott has significant indebtedness which could adversely affect its business including decreasing its business flexibility As of December 31 2020 Abbotts consolidated indebtedness was approximately 187 billion This consolidated indebtedness could have the effect among other things of reducing Abbotts flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and reducing funds available for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and other general corporate purposes Further Abbott may be required to raise additional financing for working capital capital expenditures future acquisitions or other general corporate purposes Abbotts ability to arrange additional financing or refinancing will depend on among other factors Abbotts financial position and performance as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond Abbotts control Consequently Abbott cannot assure that it will be able to obtain additional financing or refinancing on terms acceptable to Abbott or at all which could adversely impact Abbotts ability to make scheduled payments with respect to its consolidated indebtedness and its profitability and financial condition Additionally further borrowing could cause a deterioration of Abbotts credit ratings Abbotts credit ratings reflect each credit rating agencys then opinion of Abbotts financial strength operating performance and ability to meet its debt obligations Adverse changes in Abbotts credit ratings may result in increased borrowing costs for future longterm debt or shortterm borrowing facilities and may limit financing options including access to the unsecured borrowing market Abbott may also be subject to additional restrictive covenants that would reduce flexibility 10 Legal and Regulatory Risks Abbott is subject to numerous governmental regulations and it can be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant products and processes Abbotts products are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and numerous international supranational federal and state authorities The process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a drug medical device or diagnostic product can be costly and timeconsuming and approvals might not be granted for future products or additional indications or uses of existing products on a timely basis if at all Delays in the receipt of or failure to obtain approvals for future products or new indications and uses could result in delayed realization of product revenues reduction in revenues and substantial additional costs In addition no assurance can be given that Abbott will remain in compliance with applicable FDA and other regulatory requirements once approval or marketing authorization has been obtained for a product These requirements include among other things regulations regarding manufacturing practices product labeling and advertising and postmarketing reporting including adverse event reports and field alerts Many of Abbotts facilities and procedures and those of Abbotts suppliers are subject to ongoing regulation including periodic inspection by the FDA and other regulatory authorities Abbott must incur expense and spend time and effort to ensure compliance with these complex regulations Possible regulatory actions for noncompliance could include warning letters fines damages injunctions civil penalties recalls seizures of Abbotts products and criminal prosecution These actions could result in among other things substantial modifications to Abbotts business practices and operations refunds recalls or seizures of Abbotts products a total or partial shutdown of production in one or more facilities while Abbott or Abbotts suppliers remedy the alleged violation the inability to obtain future premarket approvals or marketing authorizations and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market Any of these events could disrupt Abbotts business and have a material adverse effect on Abbotts revenues profitability and financial condition Laws and regulations affecting government benefit programs could impose new obligations on Abbott require Abbott to change its business practices and restrict its operations in the future Abbotts industry is subject to various international supranational federal and state laws and regulations pertaining to government benefit program reimbursement price reporting and regulation and health care fraud and abuse including antikickback and false claims laws and international and individual state laws relating to pricing and sales and marketing practices Violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal andor civil sanctions including in some instances substantial fines imprisonment and exclusion from participation in government health care programs including Medicare Medicaid and Veterans Administration health programs in the US These laws and regulations are broad in scope and they are subject to evolving interpretations which could require Abbott to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of its sales or marketing practices In addition violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt Abbotts business and result in a material adverse effect on Abbotts revenues profitability and financial condition Changes in the health care regulatory environment may adversely affect Abbotts business Both in the US and internationally government authorities may enact changes in regulatory requirements make legislative or administrative reforms to existing reimbursement programs make adverse decisions relating to Abbotts products coverage or reimbursement or make changes to patient access to health care all of which could adversely impact the demand for and usage of Abbotts products or the prices that Abbotts customers are willing to pay for them Further in the US a number of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 address access to health care products and services These provisions may be modified expanded repealed or otherwise invalidated in whole or in part Future rulemaking could affect rebates prices or the rate of price increases for health care products and services or required reporting and disclosure Abbott cannot predict the timing or impact of any future rulemaking or changes in the law For additional information concerning health care regulation see the discussion in Regulation under Item 1 Business 11 The expiration or loss of patent protection and licenses may affect Abbotts future revenues and operating income Many of Abbotts businesses rely on patent and trademark and other intellectual property protection Although most of the challenges to Abbotts intellectual property have come from other companies governments may also challenge intellectual property protections To the extent Abbotts intellectual property is successfully challenged invalidated or circumvented or to the extent it does not allow Abbott to compete effectively Abbotts businesses could suffer To the extent that countries do not enforce Abbotts intellectual property rights Abbotts future revenues and operating income could be reduced Any material litigation regarding Abbotts patents and trademarks is described in the section captioned Legal Proceedings Significant safety concerns could arise for Abbotts products which could have a material adverse effect on Abbotts revenues and financial condition Health care products typically receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration Following regulatory approval these products will be used over longer periods of time in many patients Investigators may also conduct additional and perhaps more extensive studies If new safety issues are reported Abbott may be required to amend the conditions of use for a product For example Abbott may be required to provide additional warnings on a products label or narrow its approved intended use either of which could reduce the products market acceptance If serious safety issues arise with an Abbott product

infectious diseases like the COVID19 pandemic As a global healthcare company public health crises such as the widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases like the COVID19 pandemic may negatively impact Abbotts operations Health concerns and significant changes in political or economic conditions caused by such outbreaks can cause significant reductions in demand for routine diagnostic testing and medical device procedures or increased difficulty in serving customers disrupt manufacturing and supply chains and negatively affect our operations as well as the operations of our suppliers distributors and other thirdparty partners Furthermore such widespread outbreaks may impact the broader economies of affected countries including negatively impacting economic growth the proper functioning of financial and capital markets foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates With regard to the COVID19 pandemic the FDA issued Emergency Use Authorizations EUAs for several COVID19 related products in 2020 including Abbott diagnostic tests EUAs are authorized for the duration of the COVID19 public health emergency unless sooner terminated or revoked Abbott is actively pursuing the FDAs customary regulatory approval process for these diagnostic tests which has uncertainty as discussed in  Abbott is subject to numerous governmental regulations and it can be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant products and processes  in Legal and Regulatory Risks under Item 1A Risk Factors Due to the unpredictability of the duration and impact of the current COVID19 pandemic the extent to which the COVID19 pandemic will have a material effect on Abbotts business financial condition or results of operations is uncertain A more detailed discussion on the impact of the COVID19 pandemic on Abbotts business is contained in the Financial Review section in Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this report 12 Abbott is subject to cost containment efforts that could cause a reduction in future revenues and operating income In the United States and other countries Abbotts businesses have experienced downward pressure on product pricing Cost containment efforts by governments and private organizations are described in greater detail in the section captioned Regulation To the extent these cost containment efforts are not offset by greater patient access to health care or other factors Abbotts future revenues and operating income will be reduced Competitors intellectual property may prevent Abbott from selling its products or have a material adverse effect on Abbotts future profitability and financial condition Competitors may claim that an Abbott product infringes their intellectual property Resolving an intellectual property infringement claim can be costly and time consuming and may require Abbott to enter into license agreements Abbott cannot guarantee that it would be able to obtain license agreements on commercially reasonable terms A successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement could subject Abbott to significant damages or an injunction preventing the manufacture sale or use of affected Abbott products Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on Abbotts profitability and financial condition New products and technological advances by Abbotts competitors may negatively affect Abbotts results of operations Abbotts products face intense competition from competitive products Competitors products may be safer more effective more effectively marketed or sold or have lower prices or superior performance features than Abbotts products Abbott cannot predict with certainty the timing or impact of the introduction of competitors products Fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial statements and Abbotts ability to realize projected sales and earnings Although Abbotts financial statements are denominated in US dollars a significant portion of Abbotts revenues and costs are realized in other currencies Sales outside of the United States in 2020 made up approximately 62 percent of Abbotts net sales Abbotts profitability is affected by movement of the US dollar against other currencies Fluctuations in exchange rates between the US dollar and other currencies may also affect the reported value of Abbotts assets and liabilities as well as its cash flows Some foreign currencies are subject to government exchange controls While Abbott enters into hedging arrangements to mitigate some of its foreign currency exposure Abbott cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or its ability to mitigate these risks Information on the impact of foreign exchange rates on Abbotts financial results is contained in the Financial Review  Results of Operations section in Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this report A discussion of the steps taken to mitigate the impact of foreign exchange is contained in Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures

condition and credit quality of certain countries may negatively affect Abbotts results of operations Unfavorable economic conditions in certain countries may increase the time it takes to collect outstanding trade receivables Financial instability and fiscal deficits in these countries may result in additional austerity measures to reduce costs including health care Deterioration in the quality of sovereign debt including credit downgrades could increase Abbotts collection risk where a significant amount of Abbotts receivables in these countries are with governmental health care systems or where Abbotts customers depend on payment by government health care systems The international nature of Abbotts business subjects it to additional business risks that may cause its revenue and profitability to decline Abbotts business is subject to risks associated with managing a global supply chain and doing business internationally Sales outside of the United States in 2020 made up
