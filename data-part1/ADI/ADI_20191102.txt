and obtain patents copyrights mask works and trademarks in the United States and in selected foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate We also seek to maintain our trade secrets and confidential information by nondisclosure policies and through the use of appropriate confidentiality agreements We have obtained a substantial number of patents and trademarks in the United States and in other countries As of November 2 2019 we held approximately 3490 US patents and approximately 693 nonprovisional pending US patent applications with expiration dates ranging from 2019 through 2039 There can be no assurance however that the rights obtained can be successfully enforced against infringing products in every jurisdiction While our patents copyrights mask works trademarks and trade secrets provide some advantage and protection we believe our competitive position and future success is largely determined by such factors as the system and application knowledge innovative skills technological expertise and management ability and experience of our personnel the range and success of new products being developed by us our market brand recognition and ongoing marketing efforts and customer service and technical support It is generally our policy to seek patent protection for significant inventions that may be patented though we may elect in certain cases not to seek patent protection even for significant inventions if we determine other protection such as maintaining the invention as a trade secret to be more advantageous We also have trademarks that are used in the conduct of our business to distinguish genuine Analog Devices products and we maintain cooperative advertising programs to promote our brands and identify products containing genuine

customers in incorporating our products into their products In addition we offer a variety of webbased tools that ease product selection and aid in the design process for our customers We derived approximately 57 of our fiscal 2019 revenue from sales made to distributors We believe distributors provide a costeffective means of reaching a broad range of customers while providing efficient logistics services From time to time we may add or terminate distributors in specific geographies or move customers to a direct support or fulfillment model as we deem appropriate given our strategies the level of distributor business activity and distributor performance and financial condition 6 These distributors typically maintain an inventory of our products Some of them also sell products that compete with our products including those for which we are an alternate source We make sales to distributors under agreements that allow certain distributors to receive price adjustment credits and to return qualifying products for credit as determined by us in order to reduce the amounts of slowmoving discontinued or obsolete product from their inventory These agreements limit such returns to a certain percentage of our shipments to that distributor during the prior quarter In addition certain distributors are allowed to return unsold products if we terminate the relationship with the distributor  Additional information relating to our sales to distributors is set forth in Note 2n Revenue Recognition of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10K Customers Our primary distributors are Arrow Electronics Arrow and Macnica Inc Macnica They like our other distributors are not end customers but rather serve as a channel of sale to many end users of our products Revenue from products sold to Arrow accounted for 30 28 and 14 of net revenues in fiscal 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively Revenue from products sold to Macnica accounted for 10 of net revenues in fiscal 2019 and less than 10 in other periods presented In fiscal 2017 sales to Apple Inc one of our end customers accounted for approximately 12 of net revenues No other single end customer accounted for 10 or more of net revenues in fiscal years 2019 2018 and 2017 International sales accounted for approximately 66 63 and 60 of our net revenues in fiscal years 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively and are based on the geographic location of the distributors or OEMs who purchased our products See Note 4 Industry Segment and Geographic Information of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10K for further information about our revenue by channel and end market Seasonality Sales to customers during our first fiscal quarter may be lower than other quarters due to plant shutdowns at some of our customers during the holiday season In general the seasonality for any specific period of time has not had a material impact on our results of operations In addition as explained in our risk factors contained in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10K our revenue is more likely to be influenced on a quarter to quarter basis by cyclicality in the semiconductor industry Production and Raw Materials Monolithic IC components are manufactured in a sequence of semiconductor production steps that include wafer fabrication wafer testing dicing the wafer into individual chips or dice assembly of the dice into packages and electrical testing of the devices in final packaged form The raw materials used to manufacture these devices include silicon wafers processing chemicals including liquefied gases precious metals laminates ceramic and plastic used for packaging We utilize develop and employ a wide variety of manufacturing processes primarily based on bipolar and complementary metaloxide semiconductor CMOS transistors which are specifically tailored for use in fabricating highperformance analog DSP and mixedsignal ICs Devices such as MEMS i Couplerisolators and various sensors are fabricated using specialized processes which typically use substantially similar equipment as bipolar and CMOS processes Our IC products are fabricated on proprietary processes at our internal production facilities in Wilmington Massachusetts Milpitas California Camas Washington and Limerick Ireland and also on a mix of proprietary and nonproprietary processes at thirdparty wafer fabricators We currently source approximately half of our wafer requirements annually from thirdparty wafer fabrication foundries such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company TSMC and others typically where deepsubmicron lithography capabilities andor large manufacturing capacity is required We operate an assembly and wafer sort facility in Penang Malaysia and test facilities in the Philippines and Singapore We also make extensive use of thirdparty subcontractors for the assembly and testing of our products Capital spending was approximately 275 million in fiscal 2019 compared with approximately 255 million in fiscal 2018 and 204 million in fiscal 2017 We expect capital expenditures for the fiscal year ending October 31 2020 fiscal 2020 to be slightly below 4 of fiscal 2020 revenue Our products require a wide variety of components raw materials and external foundry services most of which we purchase from thirdparty suppliers We have multiple sources for many of the components and materials that we purchase and incorporate into our products If any of our key suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver sufficient quantities of components to us on the time schedule and of the quality that we require we may be forced to seek to engage additional or replacement suppliers which could result in significant expenses and disruptions or delays in manufacturing product development and shipment of product to our customers Although we have experienced shortages of components materials and external foundry services from time to time these items have generally been available to us as needed 7 Backlog Backlog at the end of fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 was approximately 10 billion and 14 billion respectively however as explained below we believe that our backlog at any time should not be used as an indication of future revenue We define backlog as of a particular date to mean firm orders from a customer or distributor with a requested delivery date within thirteen weeks Backlog is impacted by the tendency of customers to rely on shorter lead times available from suppliers including us in periods of depressed demand In periods of increased demand there is a tendency towards longer lead times that has the effect of increasing backlog and in some instances we may not have manufacturing capacity sufficient to fulfill all orders As is customary in the semiconductor industry we allow most orders to be canceled or deliveries to be delayed by customers without significant penalty In addition we allow certain distributors to receive price adjustment credits and to return qualifying products for credit as determined by us in order to reduce the amounts of slowmoving discontinued or obsolete product from their inventory We typically do not have longterm sales contracts with our customers In some of our markets where enduser demand may be particularly volatile and difficult to predict some customers place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it available for shipment even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all or even any of the product In other instances we manufacture product based on forecasts of customer demand As a result we may incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales and are subject to the risk of cancellation of orders leading to a sharp reduction of sales and backlog Further those orders or forecasts may be for products that meet the customers unique requirements so that those canceled orders would in addition result in an inventory of unsaleable products resulting in potential inventory writeoffs As a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for some of our products that are subject to these uncertainties the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial Government Contracts Less than 5 of our fiscal 2019 fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 revenue was attributable to sales to the US government and US government contractors and subcontractors Our government contract business is predominantly in the form of negotiated firm fixedprice subcontracts Most of these contracts and subcontracts contain standard provisions relating to termination at the election of the US government Acquisitions An element of our business strategy involves expansion through the acquisition of businesses assets products or technologies that allow us to complement our existing product offerings expand our market coverage increase our engineering workforce or enhance our technological capabilities From time to time we consider acquisitions that may strengthen our business On March 10 2017 we completed the acquisition of Linear The total consideration paid to acquire Linear was approximately 158 billion consisting of 111 billion in cash financed through existing cash on hand net proceeds from bridge and term loan facilities and proceeds received from the issuance of senior unsecured notes 46 billion from the issuance of our common stock and 01 billion of consideration related to the replacement of outstanding equity awards held by Linear employees Additional information relating to our acquisition activities during fiscal 2019 fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 is set forth in Note 6 Acquisitions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10K Competition We believe that competitive performance in the marketplace for signal processing products depends upon multiple factors including technological innovation strength of brand diversity of product portfolio product performance technical support delivery capabilities customer service quality reliability and price with the relative importance of these factors varying among products markets and customers 8 We compete with a number of semiconductor companies in markets that are highly competitive Our competitors include but are not limited to  Broadcom Inc  Monolithic Power Systems Inc  Infineon Technologies AG  NXP Semiconductors NV  Maxim Integrated Products Inc  Texas Instruments Inc  Microchip Technology

occupational health and safety We are a member of the Responsible Business Alliance RBA which was formerly known as the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition EICC Our Sustainability Report first published in 2009 states our commitment to reducing Greenhouse gas GHG emissions conserving resources by consuming less energy and water complying with our code of business conduct and ethics and applying fair labor standards among other things We are not including the information contained in our Sustainability Report in or incorporating it by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10K Our manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous and increasingly strict federal state local and foreign EHS laws and regulations particularly with respect to the transportation storage handling use emission discharge and disposal of certain chemicals used or produced in the semiconductor manufacturing process Our products are subject to increasingly stringent regulations regarding substance content in jurisdictions where we sell products including the Restriction of Hazardous Substances RoHS directive in the European Union and China and the Registration Evaluation Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals REACH directive in the European Union Contracts with many of our customers reflect these and additional EHS compliance standards Compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures earnings financial condition or competitive position There can be no assurance however that current or future environmental laws and regulations will not impose costly requirements upon us Any failure by us to comply with applicable environmental laws regulations and contractual obligations could result in fines suspension of production the need to alter manufacturing processes and legal liability Employees As of November 2 2019 we employed approximately 16400 individuals worldwide Our future success depends in large part on the continued service of our key technical and senior management personnel and on our ability to continue to attract retain and motivate qualified employees particularly those highlyskilled engineers involved in the design development support and manufacture of new and existing products and processes We believe that relations with our employees are good however the competition for such personnel is intense and the loss of key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 9 ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS Set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC are descriptions of certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements in this report Political and economic uncertainty as well as disruptions in global credit and financial markets could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations Continuing political and global macroeconomic uncertainty including escalating trade disputes between the United States and China the United Kingdoms pending withdrawal from the European Union and uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets may lead consumers and businesses to postpone or reduce spending which may cause our customers to cancel decrease or delay their existing and future orders for our products and make it difficult for us to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities Financial difficulties experienced by our customers could result in nonpayment or payment delays for previously purchased products thereby increasing our credit risk exposure Uncertainty regarding the macroeconomic conditions as well as the future stability of the global credit and financial markets could cause the value of the currency in the affected markets to deteriorate thus reducing the purchasing power of those customers Significant disruption to global credit and financial markets may also adversely affect our ability to access external financing sources on acceptable terms In addition financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers distributors or customers could result in product delays increased accounts receivable defaults and inventory challenges If economic conditions deteriorate we may record additional charges relating to restructuring costs or the impairment of assets and our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected We are exposed to business economic political legal regulatory and other risks through our significant worldwide operations which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations We have significant operations and manufacturing facilities outside the United States including in Ireland the Philippines Singapore and Malaysia A significant portion of our revenue is derived from customers in international markets and we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue in the future Risks associated with our international business operations include the following  political legal and economic changes crises or instability and civil unrest in markets in which we do business including potential macroeconomic weakness related to escalating trade disputes between the United States and China and the United Kingdoms pending withdrawal from the European Union  compliance requirements of US

costs and energy costs  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collections and longer collection periods and  costs associated with our foreign defined benefit pension plans 10 Any of these risks or any other risks related to international business operations could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations Many of these risks are present within our business operations in China For example changes in USChina relations the political environment or international trade policies and relations could result in revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement increased taxation trade sanctions the imposition of import or export duties and tariffs restrictions on imports or exports currency revaluations or retaliatory actions which has had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our business plans and operating results In addition our success in the Chinese markets may be adversely affected by Chinas continuously evolving policies laws and regulations including those relating to antitrust cybersecurity and data protection the environment indigenous innovation and the promotion of a domestic semiconductor industry and intellectual property rights and enforcement and protection of those rights At November 2 2019 our principal source of liquidity was 6483 million of cash and cash equivalents of which approximately 2957 million was held in the United States and the remaining balance was held outside the United States As we intend to reinvest substantially all of our foreign earnings indefinitely certain cash held outside the United States may not be available for repatriation as dividends to the United States in the future We require a substantial amount of cash in the United States for operating requirements stock repurchases cash dividends and acquisitions If we are unable to address our US cash requirements through operations borrowings under our current revolving credit facility future debt or equity offerings or other sources of cash obtained at an acceptable cost it may be necessary for us to consider repatriation of earnings that are indefinitely reinvested and we may be required to pay additional taxes under current tax laws which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition Our future revenue gross margins operating results net income and earnings per share are difficult to predict and may materially fluctuate Our future revenue gross margins operating results net income and earnings per share are difficult to predict and may be materially affected by a number of factors including  the effects of adverse economic conditions in the markets in which we sell our products  changes in customer demand or order

historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic upturns and downturns Our business and certain of the end markets we serve are also subject to rapid technological changes and material fluctuations in demand based on enduser preferences There can be no assurance i that products stocked in our inventory will not be rendered obsolete before we ship them or ii that we will be able to design develop and produce products in a timely fashion to accommodate changing customer demand As a result of these and other factors we may experience material fluctuations in future revenue gross margins operating results net income and earnings per share on a quarterly or annual basis Our historical financial performance and results of operations should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance or results In addition if our revenue gross margins operating results net income and earnings per share results or expectations do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors the market price of our common stock may decline Increases in our effective tax rate and exposure to additional tax liabilities may adversely impact our results of operations Our effective tax rate reflects the applicable tax rate in effect in the various tax jurisdictions around the world where our income is earned Our effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended November 2 2019 was below our US federal statutory rate of 21 It was also below our blended US federal statutory tax rate of 234 for the fiscal year ended November 3 2018 This is primarily due to lower statutory tax rates applicable to our operations in the foreign jurisdictions in which we earn income A number of factors may increase our future effective tax rate including new or revised tax laws or legislation or the interpretation of such laws or legislation by governmental authorities increases in tax rates in various jurisdictions variation in the mix of jurisdictions in which our profits are earned and taxed deferred taxes arising from basis differences in investments in foreign subsidiaries any adverse resolution of ongoing tax audits or adverse rulings from taxing authorities worldwide including our current transfer pricing appeal in Ireland changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of various tax returns increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes including executive compensation subject to the limitations of Section 162m of the Internal Revenue Code and amortization of assets acquired in connection with strategic transactions decreased availability of tax deductions for stockbased compensation awards worldwide and changes in available tax credits In addition we have a partial tax holiday through July 2025 in Malaysia The ability to extend such tax holiday beyond its expiration date cannot be assured In addition if we fail to meet certain conditions of the tax holiday we may lose the benefit of the tax holiday andor be subject to additional taxes andor penalties Any significant increase in our future effective tax rate could adversely impact our net income during future periods Compliance with the Tax Legislation may require the collection of information not regularly produced within the Company and therefore necessitate the use of estimates in our Consolidated Financial Statements and the exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions As regulations and guidance evolve with respect to the Tax Legislation and as more information is gathered and analyzed our results may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our Consolidated Financial Statements We are also subject to laws and regulations in various jurisdictions that determine how much profit has been earned and when it is subject to taxation in that jurisdiction Changes in these laws and regulations including those that align to or are associated with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Developments Base Erosion and Profit Shifting BEPS Actions Plans could impact the jurisdictions where we are deemed to earn income which could in turn adversely affect our tax liability and results of operations 12 We may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary intellectual property rights which may limit our ability to compete effectively Our future success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property We primarily rely on patent mask work copyright trademark and trade secret laws as well as nondisclosure agreements information security practices and other methods to protect our proprietary information technologies and processes Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property it is possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain or disclose our confidential information reverse engineer or copy our technologies products or processes or otherwise misappropriate our intellectual property Moreover the laws of foreign countries in which we design manufacture market and sell our products may afford little or no effective protection of our intellectual property There can be no assurance that the claims allowed in our issued patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology In addition any of our existing or future patents may be challenged invalidated or circumvented As such any rights granted under these patents may not prevent others from exploiting our proprietary technology We may not be able to obtain foreign patents or pending applications corresponding to our US patents and applications Even if patents are granted we may not be able to effectively enforce our rights If our patents and mask works do not adequately protect our technology or if our registrations expire prior to end of life of our products our competitors may be able to offer products similar to ours Our competitors may also be able to develop similar technology independently or design around our patents We generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants and strategic partners We also try to control access to and distribution of our technologies documentation and other proprietary information Despite these efforts internal or external parties may attempt to copy disclose obtain or use our products or technology without our authorization Also former employees may seek employment with our business partners customers or competitors and there can be no assurance that the confidential nature of our proprietary information will be maintained in the course of such future employment A significant disruption in or breach in security of our information technology systems or certain of our products could materially and adversely affect our business or reputation We rely on information technology systems throughout our company to keep financial records and customer data process orders manage inventory coordinate shipments to customers maintain confidential and proprietary information assist in semiconductor engineering and other technical activities and operate other critical functions such as Internet connectivity network communications and email Our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages hardware failures telecommunication failures employee malfeasance user errors catastrophes or other unforeseen events We also rely upon external cloud providers for certain infrastructure activities If we were to experience a prolonged disruption in the information technology systems that involve our internal communications or our interactions with customers or suppliers it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs which could adversely affect our business We may also be subject to security breaches of our information technology systems and certain of our products caused by viruses illegal breakins or hacking sabotage or acts of vandalism by third parties or our employees or contractors Our security measures or those of our third party service providers may not detect or prevent security breaches defects bugs or errors In addition we provide our confidential and proprietary information to our strategic partners in certain cases where doing so is necessary to conduct our business While we employ confidentiality agreements to protect such information those third parties may nonetheless also be subject to security breaches or otherwise compromise the protection of such information Security breaches of our information technology systems or those of our partners could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential and proprietary information belonging to us or to our employees partners customers suppliers or other third parties which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage Our customers typically do not make longterm product purchase commitments and incorrect forecasts or reductions cancellations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results We typically do not have sales contracts with our customers that include longterm product purchase commitments In certain markets where enduser demand may be particularly volatile and difficult to predict some customers place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it available for shipment even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all or even any of the product In other instances we manufacture product based on nonbinding forecasts of customer demands which may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly or annual basis and at times may prove to be inaccurate Additionally our US government contracts and subcontracts may be funded in increments over a number of government budget periods and typically can be terminated by the government for its convenience As a result we may incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales and we are subject to the risk of lower than expected orders or cancellations of orders leading to a sharp reduction of sales and backlog Further if orders or forecasts for products that meet a customers unique requirements are canceled or unrealized we may be left with an inventory of unsaleable products causing potential inventory writeoffs and hindering our ability to recover our costs As a result of lengthy manufacturing 13 cycles for certain of the products that are subject to these uncertainties the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial Incorrect forecasts or reductions cancellations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results Our future success depends upon our ability to execute our business strategy continue to innovate improve our existing products design develop produce and market new products and identify and enter new markets Our future success significantly depends on our ability to execute our business strategy continue to innovate improve our existing products and design develop produce and market innovative new products and systemlevel solutions Product design development innovation and enhancement is often a complex timeconsuming and costly process involving significant investment in research and development with no assurance of return on investment There can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new and improved products in a timely or efficient manner or that new and improved products if developed will achieve market acceptance Our products generally must conform to various evolving and sometimes competing industry standards which may adversely affect our ability to compete in certain markets or require us to incur significant costs In addition our customers generally impose very high quality and reliability standards on our products which often change and may be difficult or costly to satisfy Any inability to satisfy customer quality and reliability standards or comply with industry standards and technical requirements may adversely affect demand for our products and our results of operations Our growth is also dependent on our ability to identify and penetrate new markets where we have limited experience yet require significant investments resources and technological advancements in order to compete effectively and there can be no assurance that we will achieve success in these markets There can be no assurance that the markets we serve andor target based on our business strategy will grow in the future that our existing and new products will meet the requirements of these markets that our products or the endproducts in which our products are used will achieve customer acceptance in these markets that competitors will not force price reductions or take market share from us or that we can achieve or maintain adequate gross margins or profits in these markets We may not be able to compete successfully in markets within the semiconductor industry in the future We face intense competition in the semiconductor industry and we expect this competition to increase in the future including from companies located outside of the United States Competition is generally based on innovation design quality and reliability of products product performance features and functionality product pricing availability and capacity technological service and support and the availability of integrated system solutions with the relative importance of these factors varying among products markets and customers Many companies have sufficient financial manufacturing technical sales and marketing resources to develop and market products that compete with our products Some of our competitors may have more advantageous supply or development relationships with our current and potential customers or suppliers Our competitors also include both emerging companies selling specialized products in markets we serve and companies outside of the US including entities associated with wellfunded efforts by foreign governments to create indigenous semiconductor industries Existing or new competitors may develop products or technologies that more effectively address the demands of our customers and markets with enhanced performance features and functionality lower power requirements greater levels of integration or lower cost In addition as we seek to expand our business including the design and production of products and services for developing and emerging markets we may encounter increased competition from our current competitors andor new competitors Increased competition in certain markets has resulted in and may continue to result in declining average selling prices reduced gross margins and loss of market share in those markets There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by increased competition In addition the semiconductor industry has experienced significant consolidation over the past several years Consolidation among our competitors could lead to a changing competitive landscape which could negatively impact our competitive position and market share and harm our results of operations We rely on thirdparties for supply of raw materials and parts semiconductor wafer foundry services assembly and test services and transportation among other things and we generally cannot control their availability or conditions of supply or services We rely and plan to continue to rely on thirdparty suppliers and service providers including raw material and components suppliers semiconductor wafer foundries assembly and test contractors and freight carriers collectively vendors in manufacturing our products This reliance involves several risks including reduced control over availability capacity utilization delivery schedules manufacturing yields and costs We currently source approximately half of our wafer requirements annually from thirdparty wafer foundries including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company TSMC and others These foundries often provide wafer foundry services to our competitors and therefore periods of increased industry demand may result in capacity constraints In addition in certain instances one of our vendors may be the sole source of highly specialized processing services or materials If such vendor is unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver components to us on the time schedule and of the quality or quantity that we require we may be forced to seek to engage an additional or replacement vendor which could result in additional expenses and delays in product development or shipment of product to our 14 customers If additional or replacement vendors are not available we may also experience delays in product development or shipment which could in turn result in the temporary or permanent loss of customers A prolonged disruption of our internal manufacturing operations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations In addition to leveraging an outsourcing model for manufacturing operations we also rely on our internal manufacturing operations located in the United States Ireland the Philippines Singapore and Malaysia A prolonged disruption at or inability to utilize one or more of our manufacturing facilities loss of raw materials or damage to our manufacturing equipment for any reason including due to natural or manmade disasters civil unrest or other events outside of our control such as widespread outbreaks of illness or the failure to maintain our labor force at one or more of these facilities may disrupt our operations delay production shipments and revenue and result in us being unable to timely satisfy customer demand As a result we could forgo revenue opportunities potentially lose market share and damage our customer relationships all of which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow we may not be able to service our debt obligations including making payments on our outstanding indebtedness Our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness when due depends upon our future performance which will be subject to general economic conditions industry cycles and financial business and other factors affecting our consolidated operations many of which are beyond our control If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our outstanding debt we may be required to among other things  seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets  refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness  borrow under our revolving credit facility  divert funds that would otherwise be invested in growing our business operations  repatriate earnings as dividends from foreign locations with potential for negative tax consequences or  sell selected assets Such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt which could negatively impact our financial results In addition we may not be able to obtain any such financing refinancing or complete a sale of assets on economically favorable terms In the case of financing or refinancing favorable interest rates will depend on the health of the debt capital markets The markets for semiconductor products are cyclical and increased production may lead to overcapacity and lower prices and conversely we may not be able to satisfy unexpected demand for our products The cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry has resulted in periods when demand for our products has increased or decreased rapidly The demand for our products is subject to the strength of our four major end markets of Industrial Communications Automotive and Consumer If we expand our operations and workforce too rapidly or procure excessive resources in anticipation of increased demand for our products and that demand does not materialize at the pace at which we expect or declines or if we overbuild inventory in a period of decreased demand our operating results may be adversely affected as a result of increased operating expenses reduced margins underutilization of capacity or asset impairment charges These capacity expansions by us and other semiconductor manufacturers could also lead to overcapacity in our target markets which could lead to price erosion that would adversely impact our operating results Conversely during periods of rapid increases in demand our available capacity may not be sufficient to satisfy the demand In addition we may not be able to expand our workforce and operations in a sufficiently timely manner procure adequate resources and raw materials locate suitable thirdparty suppliers or respond effectively to changes in demand for our existing products or to demand for new products requested by our customers and our current or future business could be materially and adversely affected Our semiconductor products are complex and we may be subject to warranty indemnity andor product liability claims which could result in significant costs and damage to our reputation and adversely affect customer relationships the market acceptance of our products and our operating results Semiconductor products are highly complex and may contain defects that affect their quality or performance Failures in our products and services or in the products of our customers could result in damage to our reputation for reliability and increase our legal or financial exposure to third parties Certain of our products and services could also contain security vulnerabilities defects bugs and errors which could also result in significant data losses security breaches and theft of intellectual property We generally warrant that our products will meet their published specifications and that we will repair or replace defective products for one year from the date title passes from us to the customer We invest significant resources in the 15 testing of our products however if any of our products contain defects we may be required to incur additional development and remediation costs pursuant to warranty and indemnification provisions in our customer contracts and purchase orders These problems may divert our technical and other resources from other product development efforts and could result in claims against us by our customers or others including liability for costs and expenses associated with product defects including recalls which may adversely impact our operating results We may also be subject to customer intellectual property indemnity claims Our customers have on occasion been sued and may be sued in the future by third parties alleging infringement of intellectual property rights or damages resulting from use of our products Those customers may seek indemnification from us under the terms and conditions of our sales contracts with them In certain cases our potential indemnification liability may be significant Further we sell to customers in industries such as automotive including autonomous vehicles aerospace defense and healthcare where failure of the systems in which our products are integrated could cause damage to property or persons We may be subject to product liability claims if our products or the integration of our products cause system failures Any product liability claim whether or not determined in our favor could result in significant expense divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel and harm our business In addition if any of our products contain defects or have reliability quality or compatibility problems not capable of being resolved our reputation may be damaged which could make it more difficult for us to sell our products to customers and which could also adversely affect our operating results The fabrication of integrated circuits is highly complex and precise and our manufacturing processes utilize a substantial amount of technology Minute impurities contaminants in the manufacturing environment difficulties in the fabrication process defects in the masks used in the wafer manufacturing process manufacturing equipment failures wafer breakage or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous dice on each wafer to be nonfunctional While we have significant expertise in semiconductor manufacturing it is possible that some processes could become unstable This instability could result in manufacturing delays and product shortages which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results We are occasionally involved in litigation including claims regarding intellectual property rights which could be costly to litigate and could require us to redesign products or pay significant royalties The semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights Other companies or individuals have obtained patents covering a variety of semiconductor designs and processes and we might be required to obtain licenses under some of these patents or be precluded from making and selling infringing products if those patents are found to be valid and infringed by us In the event a third party makes a valid intellectual property claim against us and a license is not available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all we could be forced either to redesign or to stop production of products incorporating that intellectual property and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected Litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents or other of our intellectual property rights or to defend us against claims of infringement and this litigation could be costly and divert the attention of our key personnel We could also be subject to litigation or arbitration disputes arising under our contractual obligations as well as customer indemnity warranty or product liability claims that could lead to significant costs and expenses as we defend those claims or pay damage awards There can be no assurance that we are adequately insured to protect against all claims and potential liabilities and we may elect to selfinsure with respect to certain matters An adverse outcome in litigation or arbitration could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or on our operating results or cash flows in the period in which the dispute is resolved If we are unable to recruit or retain our key personnel our ability to execute our business strategy will be adversely affected Our continued success depends to a significant extent upon the recruitment retention and effective succession of our key personnel including our leadership team management and technical personnel particularly our experienced engineers The competition for these employees is intense The loss of key personnel or the inability to attract hire and retain key employees with critical technical skills to achieve our strategy including as a result of changes to immigration policies could also have a material adverse effect on our business We do not maintain any key person life insurance policy on any of our officers or other employees 16 To remain competitive we may need to invest in or acquire other companies purchase or license technology from third parties or enter into other strategic transactions in order to introduce new products or enhance our existing products An element of our business strategy involves expansion through the acquisitions of businesses assets products or technologies that allow us to complement our existing product offerings diversify our product portfolio expand our market coverage increase our engineering workforce expand our technical skill sets or enhance our technological capabilities We may not be able to find businesses that have the technology or resources we need and if we find such businesses we may not be able to invest in purchase or license the technology or resources on commercially favorable terms or at all Acquisitions investments and technology licenses are challenging to complete for a number of reasons including difficulties in identifying potential targets the cost of potential transactions competition among prospective buyers and licensees the need for regulatory approvals and difficulties related to integration efforts In addition investments in private companies are subject to a risk of a partial or total loss of our investment Both in the US and abroad governmental regulation of acquisitions including antitrust and other regulatory reviews and approvals has become more complex increasing the costs and risks of undertaking and consummating significant acquisitions In order to finance a potential transaction we may need to raise additional funds by issuing securities or borrowing money We may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms and the sale of our stock may result in the dilution of our existing shareholders or the issuance of securities with rights that are superior to the rights of our common shareholders Acquisitions also involve a number of challenges and risks including  diversion of managements attention in connection with both negotiating the transaction and integrating the acquired assets and businesses  difficulty or delay integrating acquired technologies operations systems and infrastructure and personnel with our existing businesses  strain on managerial and operational resources as management tries to oversee larger or more complex operations  the future funding requirements for acquired companies including research and development costs employee compensation and benefits and operating expenses which may be significant  servicing significant debt that may be incurred in connection with acquisitions  potential loss of key employees  exposure to unforeseen liabilities or regulatory compliance issues of acquired companies  higher than expected or unexpected costs relating to or associated with an acquisition and integration of assets and businesses  difficulty realizing expected cost savings operating synergies and growth prospects of an acquisition in a timely manner or at all and  increased risk of costly and timeconsuming legal proceedings If we are unable to successfully address these risks we may not realize some or all of the expected benefits of our acquisitions which may have an adverse effect on our business strategy plans and operating results We rely on supplies services and manufacturing capacity located in geologically unstable areas which could affect our ability to produce products We like many companies in the semiconductor industry rely on supplies services internal manufacturing capacity wafer fabrication foundries and other subcontractors in geologically unstable locations around the world Earthquakes tsunamis flooding or other natural disasters may disrupt local semiconductorrelated businesses and adversely affect manufacturing capacity availability and cost of key raw materials utilities and equipment and availability of key services including transport of our products worldwide Our insurance may not adequately cover losses resulting from such disruptions Any prolonged inability to utilize one of our manufacturing facilities or those of our subcontractors or thirdparty wafer fabrication foundries as a result of fire flood natural disaster unavailability of utilities or otherwise could result in a temporary or permanent loss of customers for affected products which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition Our operating results are dependent on the performance of independent distributors A significant portion of our sales are through independent global and regional distributors that are not under our control Arrow Electronics is currently our largest distributor These independent distributors generally represent product lines offered by several companies and thus could reduce their sales efforts for our products or they could terminate their representation of us We generally do not require letters of credit from our distributors including our largest distributor and are not protected against accounts receivable default or declarations of bankruptcy by these distributors Our inability to collect open accounts 17 receivable could adversely affect our operating results Termination of a significant distributor or a group of distributors whether at our initiative or the distributors initiative or through consolidation in the distribution industry could disrupt our current business and if we are unable to find suitable replacements with the appropriate scale and resources our operating results could be adversely affected Effective November 4 2018 all distributor sales are recognized upon shipment to the distributor under Accounting Standards Update 201409 Revenue from Contracts with Customers ASU 201409 We are now required to estimate the effects of returns and allowances provided to distributors and record revenue at the time of sale to the distributor If our estimates of such credits and rights are materially understated it could cause subsequent adjustments that negatively impact our revenues and gross profits in a future period We are subject to environmental health and safety EHS regulations which could increase our expenses and affect our operating results Our industry is subject to EHS requirements particularly those that control and restrict the sourcing use transportation emission discharge storage and disposal of certain substances and materials used or produced in the semiconductor manufacturing process Public attention to environmental sustainability and social responsibility concerns continues to increase and our customers routinely include stringent environmental and other standards in their contract with us Changes in EHS laws or regulations may require us to invest in costly equipment or make manufacturing process changes and may adversely affect the sourcing supply and pricing of materials used in our products In addition we use hazardous and other regulated materials that subject us to risks of strict liability for damages caused by potential or actual releases of such materials Any failure to control such materials adequately or to comply with existing or future EHS statutory or regulatory standards requirements or contractual obligations could result in any of the following each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results  liability for damages and remediation  the imposition of regulatory penalties and civil and criminal fines  the suspension or termination of the development manufacture sale or use of certain of our products  changes to our manufacturing processes or a need to substitute materials that may cost more or be less available  damage to our reputation andor  increased expenses associated with compliance Restrictions in our revolving credit facility term loan and outstanding debt instruments may limit our activities Our current revolving credit facility term loan and outstanding debt instruments impose and future debt instruments to which we may become subject may impose restrictions that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit our Company including to undertake certain transactions to create certain liens on our assets and to incur certain subsidiary indebtedness Our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors including factors that are beyond our control such as changes in technology government regulations and the level of competition in our markets In addition our revolving credit facility and term loan require us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios If we breach any of the covenants under our revolving credit facility the indentures governing our outstanding senior unsecured notes the term loan facility or any future debt instruments to which we may become subject and do not obtain appropriate waivers then subject to applicable cure periods our outstanding indebtedness thereunder could be declared immediately due and payable andor we may be restricted from further borrowing under our revolving credit facility If we fail to comply with government contracting regulations we could suffer a loss of revenue or incur price adjustments or other penalties Some of our revenue is derived from contracts with agencies of the United States government and subcontracts with its prime contractors As a United States government contractor or subcontractor we are subject to federal contracting regulations including the Federal Acquisition Regulations which govern the allowability of costs incurred by us in the performance of United States government contracts Certain contract pricing is based on estimated direct and indirect costs which are subject to change Additionally the United States government is entitled after final payment on certain negotiated contracts to examine all of our cost records with respect to such contracts and to seek a downward adjustment to the price of the contract if it determines that we failed to furnish complete accurate and current cost or pricing data in connection with the negotiation of the price of the contract In connection with our United States government business we are also subject to government audits and to review and approval of our policies procedures and internal controls for compliance with procurement regulations and applicable laws In certain circumstances if we do not comply with the terms of a contract or with regulations or statutes we could be subject to 18 downward contract price adjustments or refund obligations or could in extreme circumstances be assessed civil and criminal penalties or be debarred or suspended from obtaining future contracts for a specified period of time Any such suspension or debarment or other sanction could have an adverse effect on our business Under some of our government subcontracts we are required to maintain secure facilities and to obtain security clearances for personnel involved in performance of the contract in compliance with applicable federal standards If we were unable to comply with these requirements or if personnel critical to our performance of these contracts were unable to obtain or maintain their security clearances we might be unable to perform these contracts or compete for other projects of this nature which could adversely affect our revenue Our stock price may be volatile The market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past and may be volatile in the future as it may be significantly affected by factors including  global economic conditions generally  crises in global credit debt and financial markets  actual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and operating results  changes in financial estimates or other statements made by securities analysts or others in analyst reports or other publications or our failure to perform in line with those estimates or statements or our published guidance  financial results and prospects of our customers  US and foreign government actions including with respect to trade travel export and taxation  changes in market valuations of other semiconductor companies  rumors and speculation in the press investment community or on social media about us our customers or other companies in our industry  announcements by us our customers or our competitors of significant new products technical innovations material transactions acquisitions or dispositions litigation capital commitments or revised earnings estimates  departures of key personnel  alleged noncompliance with laws regulations or ethics standards by us or any of our employees officers or directors and  negative media publicity targeting us or our suppliers customers or competitors The stock market has historically experienced volatility especially within the semiconductor industry that often has been unrelated to the performance of particular companies These market fluctuations may cause our stock price to fall regardless of our operating results Our directors and executive officers periodically sell shares of our common stock in the market including pursuant to Rule 10b51 trading plans Regardless of the individuals reasons for such sales securities analysts and investors could view such sales as a negative indicator and our stock price could be adversely affected as a result ITEM 1B
