Our markets are characterized by rapid technological changes and advances Accordingly we make substantial investments in the design and development of new products and manufacturing processes and the improvement of existing products and manufacturing processes We spent approximately 654 million during fiscal 2016 on the design development and improvement of new and existing products and manufacturing processes compared to approximately 637 million during the fiscal year ended October 31 2015 fiscal 2015  and approximately 560 million during the fiscal year ended November 1 2014 fiscal 2014  Our research and development strategy focuses on building technical leadership in core technology platforms which include converters amplifiers and RF and microwave MEMS power management and DSP In support of our research and development activities we employ thousands of engineers involved in product and manufacturing process development throughout the world Patents and Other Intellectual Property Rights We seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products through the use of patents copyrights mask works trademarks and trade secrets We have a program to file applications for and obtain patents copyrights mask works and trademarks in the United States and in selected foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate We also seek to maintain our trade secrets and confidential information by nondisclosure policies and through the use of appropriate confidentiality agreements We have obtained a substantial number of patents and trademarks in the United States and in other countries As of October 29 2016  we held approximately 2440 US patents and approximately 537 nonprovisional pending US patent applications with expiration dates ranging from 2016 through 2035 There can be no assurance however that the rights obtained can be successfully enforced against infringing products in every jurisdiction While our patents copyrights mask works trademarks and trade secrets provide some advantage and protection we believe our competitive position and future success is largely determined by such factors as the system and application knowledge innovative skills technological expertise and management ability and experience of our personnel the range and success of new products being developed by us our market brand recognition and ongoing marketing efforts and customer service and technical support It is generally our policy to seek patent protection for significant inventions that may be patented though we may elect in certain cases not to seek patent protection even for significant inventions if we determine other protection such as maintaining the invention as a trade secret to be more advantageous We also have trademarks that are used in the conduct of our business to distinguish genuine Analog Devices products and we maintain cooperative advertising programs to promote our brands and identify products containing genuine Analog Devices components Sales Channels We sell our products globally through a direct sales force thirdparty distributors independent

catalogs We maintain a staff of field application engineers who aid customers in incorporating our products into their products In addition we offer a variety of webbased tools that ease product selection and aid in the design process for our customers We derived approximately 52 of our fiscal 2016 revenue from sales made through distributors These distributors typically maintain an inventory of our products Some of them also sell products that compete with our products including those for which we are an alternate source In all regions of the world we defer revenue and the related cost of sales on shipments to distributors until the distributors resell the products to their customers We make sales to distributors under agreements that allow distributors to receive price adjustment credits and to return qualifying products for credit as determined by us in order to reduce the amounts of slowmoving discontinued or obsolete product from their inventory These agreements limit such returns to a certain percentage of our shipments to that distributor during the prior quarter In addition distributors are allowed to return unsold products if we terminate the relationship with the distributor Additional information relating to our sales to distributors is set forth in Note 2n Revenue Recognition of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10K Segment Financial Information and Geographic Information We operate and track our results in one reportable segment based on the aggregation of seven operating segments Through subsidiaries and affiliates we conduct business in numerous countries outside the United States During fiscal 2016  we derived approximately 62 of our revenue from customers in international markets Our international business is subject to risks customarily encountered in foreign operations including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and controls import and export controls and other laws policies and regulations of foreign governments Although we engage in hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations our competitive position may be adversely affected by changes in the exchange rate of the United States dollar against other currencies Revenue by geographic region based on the primary location of our customers design activity for our products for fiscal 2016 was as follow Percent of Fiscal 2016 Geographic Area Revenue United States 38 Rest of NorthSouth America 3 Europe 27 Japan 9 China 17 Rest of Asia 7  The sum of the individual percentages does not equal 100 due to rounding For further detail regarding revenue and other financial information about our industry segment and geographic areas see our Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 4 Industry Segment and Geographic Information of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10K For a discussion of important risk factors that may materially affect us see the Risk Factors contained in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10K Customers We have over 100000 customers worldwide Our largest single customer represented approximately 12 of fiscal 2016 revenue and 13 of fiscal 2015 revenue No sales to an individual customer accounted for more than 10 of fiscal 2014 revenue Our customers use hundreds of different types of our products in a wide range of applications spanning the industrial automotive consumer and communication markets Our 20 largest customers accounted for approximately 39 of our fiscal 2016 revenue Seasonality Sales to customers during our first fiscal quarter may be lower than other quarters due to plant shutdowns at some of our customers during the holiday season In general the seasonality for any specific period of time has not had a material impact on 7 our results of operations In addition as explained in our risk factors contained in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10K our revenue is more likely to be influenced on a quarter to quarter basis by cyclicality in the semiconductor industry Production and Raw Materials Monolithic IC components are manufactured in a sequence of semiconductor production steps that include wafer fabrication wafer testing cutting the wafer into individual chips or dice assembly of the dice into packages and electrical testing of the devices in final packaged form The raw materials used to manufacture these devices include silicon wafers processing chemicals including liquefied gases precious metals and ceramic and plastic used for packaging We develop and employ a wide variety of proprietary manufacturing processes that are specifically tailored for use in fabricating highperformance analog DSP mixedsignal and MEMS ICs We also use bipolar and complementary metaloxide semiconductor CMOS wafer fabrication processes Our IC products are fabricated both at our production facilities and by thirdparty wafer fabricators Our products are manufactured in our own wafer fabrication facilities using proprietary processes and at thirdparty waferfabrication foundries using submicron digital CMOS processes We currently source approximately 60 of our wafer requirements annually from thirdparty wafer fabrication foundries primarily Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company TSMC We operate wafer fabrication facilities in Wilmington Massachusetts and Limerick Ireland We also operate test facilities located in the Philippines and use thirdparty subcontractors for the assembly and testing of our products Capital spending was approximately 127 million in fiscal 2016  compared with approximately 154 million in fiscal 2015  We expect capital expenditures for the fiscal year ending October 28 2017  fiscal 2017  to be in the range of 125 million to 145 million Our products require a wide variety of components raw materials and external foundry services most of which we purchase from thirdparty suppliers We have multiple sources for many of the components and materials that we purchase and incorporate into our products However a large portion of our external wafer purchases and foundry services are from a limited number of suppliers primarily TSMC If TSMC or any of our other key suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver sufficient quantities of components to us on the time schedule and of the quality that we require we may be forced to seek to engage additional or replacement suppliers which could result in significant expenses and disruptions or delays in manufacturing product development and shipment of product to our customers Although we have experienced shortages of components materials and external foundry services from time to time these items have generally been available to us as needed Backlog Backlog at the end of fiscal 2016 was approximately 700 million  up from approximately 626 million at the end of fiscal 2015  We define backlog as of a particular date to mean firm orders from a customer or distributor with a requested delivery date within thirteen weeks Backlog is impacted by the tendency of customers to rely on shorter lead times available from suppliers including us in periods of depressed demand In periods of increased demand there is a tendency towards longer lead times that has the effect of increasing backlog and in some instances we may not have manufacturing capacity sufficient to fulfill all orders As is customary in the semiconductor industry we allow most orders to be canceled or deliveries to be delayed by customers without significant penalty Accordingly we believe that our backlog at any time should not be used as an indication of our future revenue We typically do not have longterm sales contracts with our customers In some of our markets where enduser demand may be particularly volatile and difficult to predict some customers place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it available for shipment even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all or even any of the product In other instances we manufacture product based on forecasts of customer demand As a result we may incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales and are subject to the risk of cancellation of orders leading to a sharp reduction of sales and backlog Further those orders or forecasts may be for products that meet the customers unique requirements so that those canceled orders would in addition result in an inventory of unsaleable products resulting in potential inventory writeoffs As a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for some of our products that are subject to these uncertainties the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial Government Contracts Less than 5 of our fiscal 2016 revenue was attributable to sales to the US government and US government contractors and subcontractors Our government contract business is predominantly in the form of negotiated firm fixedprice subcontracts Most of these contracts and subcontracts contain standard provisions relating to termination at the election of the US government 8 Acquisitions Divestitures and Investments An element of our business strategy involves expansion through the acquisition of businesses assets products or technologies that allow us to complement our existing product offerings expand our market coverage increase our engineering workforce or enhance our technological capabilities From time to time we consider acquisitions and divestitures that may strengthen our business As noted above on July 26 2016 we entered into the Merger Agreement to acquire Linear Under the terms of the Merger Agreement Linear stockholders will receive for each outstanding share of Linear common stock 4600 in cash and 02321 of a share of the Companys common stock at the closing Based on the number of outstanding shares of Linear common stock as of July 26 2016 and the Companys 5day volume weighted average price as of July 21 2016 the value of the total consideration to be paid by us is estimated to be approximately 148 billion  to be funded with the issuance of approximately 580 million new shares of the Companys common stock and approximately 116 billion of new short and longterm indebtedness The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions including remaining required regulatory clearances On July 22 2014 we completed the acquisition of Hittite Microwave Corporation Hittite a company that designed and developed high performance integrated circuits modules subsystems and instrumentation for radio frequency microwave and millimeterwave applications The total consideration paid to acquire Hittite was approximately 24 billion financed through a combination of existing cash on hand and a 90day term loan facility of 20 billion Additional information relating to our acquisition activities during fiscal years 2016  2015 and 2014 is set forth in Note 6 Acquisitions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10K There were no divestitures during any of the fiscal years presented Competition We believe that competitive performance in the marketplace for signal processing products depends upon multiple factors including technological innovation strength of brand diversity of product portfolio product performance technical support delivery capabilities customer service quality reliability and price with the relative importance of these factors varying among products markets and customers We compete with a number of semiconductor companies in markets that are highly competitive Our competitors include but are not limited to  Robert Bosch GmbH  Maxim Integrated Products Inc  Broadcom Limited  Microchip Technology Inc  Infineon Technologies  NXP Semiconductors  Linear Technology Corporation  Texas Instruments Inc We believe that our technical innovation emphasizing product performance and reliability supported by our commitment to strong customer service and technical support enables us to make a fundamental difference to our customers competitiveness in our chosen markets Environment Health and Safety We are committed to protecting the environment and the health and safety of our employees customers and the public We endeavor to adhere to applicable environmental health and safety EHS regulatory and industry standards across all of our facilities and to encourage pollution prevention reduce our water and energy consumption reduce waste generation and strive towards continual improvement We strive to achieve excellence in EHS management practices as an integral part of our total quality management system Our EHS management systems are certified to ISO 14001 for environmental and OHSAS 18001 for occupational health and safety We are a member of the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition EICC Our Sustainability Report first published in 2009 states our commitment to reducing Greenhouse gas GHG emissions conserving resources by consuming less energy and water complying with our code of business conduct and ethics and applying fair labor standards among other things We are not including the information contained in our Sustainability Report in or incorporating it by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10K Our manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous and increasingly strict federal state local and foreign EHS laws and regulations particularly with respect to the transportation storage handling use emission discharge and disposal of certain chemicals used or produced in the semiconductor manufacturing process Our products are subject to increasingly stringent 9 regulations regarding chemical content in jurisdictions where we sell products including the Restriction of Hazardous Substances RoHS directive in the European Union and China and the Registration Evaluation Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals REACH directive in the European Union Contracts with many of our customers reflect these and additional EHS compliance standards Compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures earnings financial condition or competitive position There can be no assurance however that current or future environmental laws and regulations will not impose costly requirements upon us Any failure by us to comply with applicable environmental laws regulations and contractual obligations could result in fines suspension of production the need to alter manufacturing processes and legal liability Employees As of October 29 2016  we employed approximately 10000 individuals worldwide Our future success depends in large part on the continued service of our key technical and senior management personnel and on our ability to continue to attract retain and motivate qualified employees particularly those highlyskilled design process test and applications engineers involved in the design support and manufacture of new and existing products and processes We believe that relations with our employees are good however the competition for such personnel is intense and the loss of key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 10 ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS Set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the SEC are descriptions of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements contained in this report Risks Related to the Proposed Acquisition of Linear Technology Corporation Our ability to complete the acquisition of Linear Technology Corporation Linear is subject to various closing conditions including the receipt of consents and approvals from governmental authorities which may impose conditions that could adversely affect us or cause the acquisition to be abandoned We and Linear must make certain filings with and obtain certain consents and approvals from various governmental and regulatory authorities We have not yet obtained all regulatory consents and approvals required to complete the acquisition Governmental or regulatory agencies could seek to block or challenge the acquisition Even if these regulatory consents and approvals are obtained the governmental authorities from which these approvals are required may impose conditions on the completion of the acquisition including requiring significant divestitures or placing restrictions on the conduct of the combined companys business which could have an adverse effect on the combined company following the acquisition The merger agreement may require us to accept certain conditions from these regulators that could adversely impact the combined company If we agree to undertake divestitures or comply with operating restrictions in order to obtain any approvals required to complete the acquisition we may be less able to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition and the business and results of operations of the combined company after the acquisition may be adversely affected If all required regulatory consents and approvals are not received or they are not received on terms that satisfy the conditions set forth in the merger agreement then neither we nor Linear will be obligated to complete the acquisition Under the merger agreement we could be required under certain circumstances to pay Linear a termination fee of 700 million If such a termination fee is payable the payment of this fee could have material and adverse consequences to our financial condition and operations The applicable waiting period for the acquisition under the Hart Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 as amended expired on October 19 2016 and as a result the acquisition has been cleared for US antitrust purposes In addition we have received clearances for the acquisition from antitrust regulators in Germany Japan and Israel We can provide no assurance that the various closing conditions will be satisfied and that the necessary approvals will be obtained or that any required conditions will not materially adversely affect the combined company following the acquisition In addition we can provide no assurance that these conditions will not result in the abandonment or delay of the acquisition The occurrence of any of these events individually or in combination could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and the trading price of our common stock We will incur significant acquisitionrelated costs in connection with the Linear acquisition and the combined company could incur substantial expenses related to the integration of Linear We expect to incur costs associated with combining our operations with Linears operations as well as transaction fees and other costs related to the acquisition Many of these costs will be borne by us even if the acquisition is not completed We will incur through completion of the acquisition and the combined company will incur following the completion of the acquisition substantial expenses in connection with integrating each companys respective businesses policies procedures operations technologies and systems These integration expenses may result in significant charges taken against earnings by us prior to completion of the acquisition and by the combined company following the completion of the acquisition We will incur significant indebtedness in connection with the merger which could reduce our flexibility to operate our business and increase our interest expense In connection with the planned acquisition we entered into a commitment letter dated as of July 26 2016 the Commitment Letter with JPMorgan Chase Bank NA Bank of America NA Merrill Lynch Pierce Fenner  Smith Incorporated Credit Suisse AG and Credit Suisse Securities USA LLC which was subsequently joined on August 10 2016 by The Bank of TokyoMitsubishi UFJ Ltd together the Commitment Parties pursuant to which the Commitment Parties committed to arrange and provide subject to the terms and conditions of the Commitment Letter a 364day senior unsecured bridge facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to 75 billion and a 90day senior unsecured bridge facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to 41 billion On September 23 2016 we entered into a term loan facility composed of a 25 billion threeyear unsecured term loan facility and 25 billion fiveyear unsecured term loan facility collectively the Term Loan Facility and an amended and restated revolving credit agreement Revolving Credit Facility which expires on July 10 2020 Borrowings under the Term Loan Facility are available upon consummation of the planned acquisition of Linear Additionally upon the consummation of the planned acquisition of Linear the aggregate commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility will increase from 750 million to 1 billion and certain other amendments to the Revolving Credit 11 Facility will become effective As a result of our entry into the Term Loan Facility the commitments under the 364day senior unsecured bridge facility were reduced from 75 billion to 25 billion Upon consummation of the merger our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness when due depends upon our future performance which will be subject to general economic conditions industry cycles and financial business and other factors affecting our consolidated operations many of which are beyond our control In addition the amount of cash required to make principal and interest payments on our increased indebtedness levels following completion of the merger and thus the demands on our cash resources will be greater than the amount of cash flows required to service our indebtedness prior to the completion of the merger This increased indebtedness could also have the effect among other things of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and reducing funds available for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and other general corporate purposes and may create competitive disadvantages relative to other companies with lower debt levels If we do not achieve the expected benefits and cost savings from the merger or if the financial performance of the combined company does not meet current expectations then our ability to service our indebtedness may be adversely impacted The market value of our common stock could decline if large amounts of our common stock are sold following the Linear acquisition Following the acquisition our shareholders and former Linear stockholders will own interests in a combined company operating an expanded business with more assets and a different mix of liabilities Our current shareholders and the current Linear stockholders may not wish to continue to invest in the combined company or may wish to reduce their investment in the combined company in order to comply with institutional investing guidelines to increase diversification or to track any rebalancing of stock indices in which our or Linears common stock is or was included If following the acquisition large amounts of our common stock are sold the price of our common stock could decline The pendency of the Linear acquisition could adversely affect us In connection with the pending acquisition some of our suppliers and customers may delay or defer sales and purchasing decisions which could negatively impact revenues earnings and cash flows regardless of whether the acquisition is completed Following the Linear acquisition the combined company may encounter difficulties in integrating our and Linears businesses and realizing the anticipated benefits of the acquisition The acquisition involves the combination of two companies which currently operate as independent public companies The combined company will be required to devote management attention and resources to integrating its business practices and operations and prior to the acquisition management attention and resources will be required to plan for such integration Potential difficulties the combined company may encounter in the integration process include the following  the inability to successfully integrate the respective businesses of the two companies in a manner that permits the combined company to achieve the cost savings and operating synergies anticipated to result from the acquisition which could result in the anticipated benefits of the acquisition not being realized partly or wholly in the time frame currently anticipated or at all  lost sales and customers as a result of certain customers of either or both of the two companies deciding not to do business with the combined company or deciding to decrease their amount of business in order to reduce their reliance on a single company  integrating personnel and IT systems from the two companies while maintaining focus on providing consistent high quality products and services  potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses delays or regulatory conditions associated with the acquisition and  performance shortfalls at one or both of the two companies as a result of the diversion of managements attention caused by completing the acquisition and integrating the companies operations Any of these factors could result in the combined company failing to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition on the expected timeline or at all Risks Relating to the Business Disruptions in global credit and financial markets could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations There is significant continuing uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets These economic uncertainties may lead consumers and businesses to postpone spending which may cause our customers to cancel decrease or delay their existing and future orders for our products and make it difficult for us to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities Significant disruption to global credit and financial markets may also adversely affect our ability to access 12 external financing sources on acceptable terms Financial difficulties experienced by our customers could result in nonpayment or payment delays for previously purchased products thereby increasing our credit risk exposure Uncertainty regarding the future stability of the global credit and financial markets could cause the value of the currency in the affected markets to deteriorate thus reducing the purchasing power of those customers In addition financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers or distributors could result in product delays increased accounts receivable defaults and inventory challenges During the past few years many governments adopted stimulus or spending programs designed to ease the economic impact of the crisis Some of our businesses benefited from these stimulus programs but there can be no assurance that such programs will continue in the future If economic conditions deteriorate we may record additional charges relating to restructuring costs or the impairment of assets and our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected Our future revenue gross margins operating results net income and earnings per share are difficult to predict and may materially fluctuate Our future revenue gross margins operating results net income and earnings per share are difficult to predict and may be materially affected by a number of factors including  the effects of adverse economic conditions in the markets in which we sell our products  changes in customer demand for our products andor for end products that incorporate our products  the timing delay reduction or cancellation of significant customer orders and our ability to manage inventory  fluctuations in customer order patterns and seasonality  our ability to effectively manage our cost structure in both the short term and over a longer duration  changes in geographic product or customer mix  changes in our effective tax rates in the United States Ireland or worldwide  the timing of new product announcements or introductions by us our customers or our competitors and the market acceptance of such products  competitive pricing pressures  fluctuations in manufacturing yields adequate availability of wafers and other raw materials and manufacturing assembly and test capacity  the ability of our thirdparty suppliers subcontractors and manufacturers to supply us with sufficient quantities of raw materials products andor components  a decline in infrastructure spending by foreign governments including China  a decline in the US Government defense budget changes in spending or budgetary priorities a prolonged US Government shutdown or delays in contract awards  any significant decline in our backlog  our ability to recruit hire retain and motivate adequate numbers of engineers and other qualified employees to meet the demands of our customers  our ability to generate new design opportunities and win competitive bid selection processes  the increasing costs of providing employee benefits including health insurance retirement plan and pension plan contributions and retirement benefits  our ability to utilize our manufacturing facilities at efficient levels  potential significant litigationrelated costs or product warranty andor indemnity claims including those not covered by our suppliers or insurers  the difficulties inherent in forecasting future operating expense levels including with respect to costs associated with labor utilities transportation and raw materials  the costs related to compliance with increasing worldwide government environmental and social responsibility regulations  new accounting pronouncements or changes in existing accounting standards and practices and 13  the effects of public health emergencies natural disasters widespread travel disruptions security risks terrorist activities international conflicts government sanctions and other events beyond our control In addition the semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic upturns and downturns Our business and certain of the end markets we serve are also subject to rapid technological changes and material fluctuations in demand based on enduser preferences There can be no assurance i that products stocked in our inventory will not be rendered obsolete before we ship them or ii that we will be able to design develop and produce products in a timely fashion to accommodate changing customer demand As a result of these and other factors we may experience material fluctuations in future revenue gross margins operating results net income and earnings per share on a quarterly or annual basis Our historical financial performance and results of operations should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance or results In addition if our revenue gross margins operating results net income and earnings per share results or expectations do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors the market price of our common stock may decline Increases in our effective tax rate and exposure to additional tax liabilities may adversely impact our results of operations Our effective tax rate reflects the applicable tax rate in effect in the various tax jurisdictions around the world where our income is earned Our effective tax rate in 2016 was below the US federal statutory tax rate of 35 primarily due to lower statutory tax rates applicable to our operations in the foreign jurisdictions in which we earn income A number of factors may increase our future effective tax rate including new or revised tax laws or legislation or the interpretation of such laws or legislation by governmental authorities increases in tax rates in various jurisdictions variation in the mix of jurisdictions in which our profits are earned and taxed repatriation of nonUS earnings any adverse resolution of ongoing tax audits or adverse rulings from taxing authorities worldwide changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of various tax returns increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes including executive compensation subject to the limitations of Section 162m of the Internal Revenue Code and amortization of assets acquired in connection with strategic transactions decreased availability of tax deductions for stockbased compensation awards worldwide and changes in available tax credits Any significant increase in our future effective tax rate could adversely impact our net income during future periods On October 5 2015 the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD an international association of thirty four countries including the US and UK released the final reports from its Base Erosion and Profit Shifting BEPS Action Plans The BEPS recommendations covered a number of issues including countrybycountry reporting permanent establishment rules transfer pricing rules and tax treaties Future tax reform resulting from this development may result in changes to longstanding tax principles which could adversely affect our effective tax rate or result in higher cash tax liabilities Longterm contracts are not typical for us and incorrect forecasts or reductions cancellations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results We typically do not have longterm sales contracts with our customers In certain markets where enduser demand may be particularly volatile and difficult to predict some customers place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it available for shipment even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all or even any of the product In other instances we manufacture product based on forecasts of customer demands which may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly or annual basis Additionally our US government contracts and subcontracts may be funded in increments over a number of government budget periods and typically can be terminated by the government for its convenience As a result we may incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales and we are subject to the risk of lower than expected orders or cancellations of orders leading to a sharp reduction of sales and backlog Further orders or forecasts for products that meet the customers unique requirements and that are canceled or unrealized orders would in addition result in an inventory of unsaleable products causing potential inventory writeoffs and we may be unable to recover all of our costs incurred or committed As a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for certain of the products that are subject to these uncertainties the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial Incorrect forecasts or reductions cancellations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results Our future success depends upon our ability to execute our business strategy continue to innovate improve our existing products design develop produce and market new products and identify and enter new markets Our future success significantly depends on our continued ability to execute our business strategy continue to improve our existing products and design develop produce and market innovative new products Product design development innovation and enhancement is often a complex timeconsuming and costly process involving significant investment in research and development with no assurance of return on investment There can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new and improved products in a timely or efficient manner or that new and improved products if developed will achieve market acceptance Our products generally must conform to various evolving and sometimes competing industry standards which may adversely affect our ability to compete in certain markets or require us to incur 14 significant costs In addition our customers generally impose very high quality and reliability standards on our products which often change and may be difficult or costly to satisfy Any inability to satisfy customer quality and reliability standards or comply with industry standards and technical requirements may adversely affect demand for our products and our results of operations In addition our growth is dependent on our ability to generate new design opportunities and win competitive bid selection processes Failure to obtain a particular design win may prevent us from obtaining design wins in subsequent generations of a particular product which could weaken our position in future competitive selection processes Our growth is also dependent on our ability to identify and penetrate new markets where we have limited experience and competition is intense Some of our customers in new markets are less established which could subject us to increased credit risk There can be no assurance that the markets we serve andor target based on our business strategy will grow in the future that our existing and new products will meet the requirements of these markets that our products or the products in which our products are used will achieve customer acceptance in these markets that competitors will not force price reductions or take market share from us or that we can achieve or maintain adequate gross margins or profits in these markets Additionally developing markets such as the developing Internet of Things IoT market require significant investments resources and technological advancement in order to compete effectively and there can be no assurance that we will achieve success in these markets Furthermore a decline in demand in one or several of our enduser markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and our results of operations We may not be able to compete successfully in markets within the semiconductor industry in the future We face intense competition in the semiconductor industry and we expect this competition to increase in the future including from companies located outside of the United States Competition is generally based on innovation design quality and reliability of products product performance features and functionality product pricing availability and capacity technological service and support and the availability of integrated system solutions with the relative importance of these factors varying among products markets and customers Many companies have sufficient financial manufacturing technical sales and marketing resources to develop and market products that compete with our products Some of our competitors may have more advantageous supply or development relationships with our current and potential customers or suppliers Our competitors also include emerging companies selling specialized products in markets we serve and entities outside of the US including entities associated with efforts by foreign governments to create indigenous semiconductor industries Existing or new competitors may develop products or technologies that more effectively address the demands of our customers and markets with enhanced performance features and functionality lower power requirements greater levels of integration or lower cost In addition as we seek to expand our business including the design and production of products and services for the IoT market we may encounter increased competition from our current competitors andor new competitors Increased competition in certain markets has resulted in and may continue to result in declining average selling prices reduced gross margins and loss of market share in those markets There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by increased competition In addition the semiconductor industry has experienced significant consolidation over the past several years Consolidation among our competitors could lead to a changing competitive landscape which could negatively impact our competitive position and market share and harm our results of operations We rely on thirdparty suppliers subcontractors and manufacturers for some industrystandard wafers manufacturing processes assembly and test services and transportation and we generally cannot control their availability or conditions of supply We rely and plan to continue to rely on thirdparty suppliers assembly and test subcontractors freight carriers and wafer fabricators collectively suppliers to supply most of our wafers that can be manufactured using industrystandard submicron processes This reliance involves several risks including reduced control over availability capacity utilization delivery schedules manufacturing yields and costs We currently source approximately 60 of our wafer requirements annually from thirdparty wafer fabrication foundries primarily Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company TSMC  In addition these suppliers often provide manufacturing services to our competitors and therefore periods of increased industry demand may result in capacity constraints In certain instances the thirdparty supplier is the sole source of highly specialized processing services If our suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver components to us on the time schedule and of the quality or quantity that we require or provide us with required manufacturing processes we may be forced to seek to engage additional or replacement suppliers which could result in additional expenses and delays in product development or shipment of product to our customers If additional or replacement suppliers or manufacturing processes are not available we may also experience delays in product development or shipment which could in turn result in the temporary or permanent loss of customers The markets for semiconductor products are cyclical and increased production may lead to overcapacity and lower prices and conversely we may not be able to satisfy unexpected demand for our products 15 The cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry has resulted in periods when demand for our products has increased or decreased rapidly The demand for our products is subject to the strength of our four major end markets of Industrial Communications Infrastructure Automotive and Consumer If we expand our operations and workforce too rapidly or procure excessive resources in anticipation of increased demand for our products and that demand does not materialize at the pace at which we expect or declines or if we overbuild inventory in a period of decreased demand our operating results may be adversely affected as a result of increased operating expenses reduced margins underutilization of capacity or asset impairment charges These capacity expansions by us and other semiconductor manufacturers could also lead to overcapacity in our target markets which could lead to price erosion that would adversely impact our operating results Conversely during periods of rapid increases in demand our available capacity may not be sufficient to satisfy the demand In addition we may not be able to expand our workforce and operations in a sufficiently timely manner procure adequate resources and raw materials locate suitable thirdparty suppliers or respond effectively to changes in demand for our existing products or to demand for new products requested by our customers and our current or future business could be materially and adversely affected Our semiconductor products are complex and we may be subject to product warranty and indemnity claims which could result in significant costs and damage to our reputation and adversely affect the market acceptance of our products Semiconductor products are highly complex and may contain defects when they are first introduced or as new versions are developed We generally warrant our products to our customers for one year from the date title passes from us We invest significant resources in the testing of our products however if any of our products contain defects we may be required to incur additional development and remediation costs pursuant to warranty and indemnification provisions in our customer contracts and purchase orders These problems may divert our technical and other resources from other product development efforts and could result in claims against us by our customers or others including liability for costs associated with product recalls which may adversely impact our operating results We may also be subject to customer indemnity claims Our customers have on occasion been sued and may be sued in the future by third parties alleging infringement of intellectual property rights or damages resulting from use of our products Those customers may seek indemnification from us under the terms and conditions of our sales contracts with them In certain cases our potential indemnification liability may be significant If any of our products contains defects or has reliability quality or compatibility problems our reputation may be damaged which could make it more difficult for us to sell our products to existing and prospective customers and could also adversely affect our operating results We have manufacturing processes that utilize a substantial amount of technology as the fabrication of integrated circuits is a highly complex and precise process Minute impurities contaminants in the manufacturing environment difficulties in the fabrication process defects in the masks used in the wafer manufacturing process manufacturing equipment failures wafer breakage or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous dice on each wafer to be nonfunctional While we have significant expertise in semiconductor manufacturing it is possible that some processes could become unstable This instability could result in manufacturing delays and product shortages which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results We are involved in frequent litigation including claims regarding intellectual property rights which could be costly to bring or defend and could require us to redesign products or pay significant royalties The semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights including claims arising under our contractual obligations to indemnify our customers Other companies or individuals have obtained patents covering a variety of semiconductor designs and processes and we might be required to obtain licenses under some of these patents or be precluded from making and selling infringing products if those patents are found to be valid and infringed by us In the event a third party makes a valid intellectual property claim against us and a license is not available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all we could be forced either to redesign or to stop production of products incorporating that intellectual property and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected Litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents or other of our intellectual property rights or to defend us against claims of infringement and this litigation could be costly and divert the attention of our key personnel We could also be subject to litigation or arbitration disputes arising under our contractual obligations as well as indemnity warranty or product liability claims that could lead to significant costs and expenses as we defend those claims or pay damage awards There can be no assurance that we are adequately insured to protect against all claims and potential liabilities and we may elect to selfinsure with respect to certain matters We may incur costs and expenses relating to a recall of our customers products due to an alleged failure of components we supply An adverse outcome in litigation or arbitration could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or on our operating results or cash flows in the period in which the dispute is resolved We may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary intellectual property rights which may limit our ability to compete effectively 16 Our future success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property We primarily rely on patent mask work copyright trademark and trade secret laws as well as nondisclosure agreements and other methods to protect our proprietary technologies and processes Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property it is possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain copy reverse engineer use or disclose our technologies products and processes Moreover the laws of foreign countries in which we design manufacture market and sell our products may afford little or no effective protection of our proprietary intellectual property There can be no assurance that the claims allowed in our issued patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology In addition any of our existing or future patents may be challenged invalidated or circumvented As such any rights granted under these patents may not provide us with adequate protection We may not be able to obtain foreign patents or pending applications corresponding to our US patents and applications Even if foreign patents are granted effective enforcement in foreign countries may not be available If our patents and mask works do not adequately protect our technology our competitors may be able to offer products similar to ours Our competitors may also be able to develop similar technology independently or design around our patents We generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants and strategic partners We also try to control access to and distribution of our technologies documentation and other proprietary information Despite these efforts internal or external parties may attempt to copy disclose obtain or use our products or technology without our authorization Also former employees may seek employment with our business partners customers or competitors and there can be no assurance that the confidential nature of our proprietary information will be maintained in the course of such future employment A significant disruption in or breach in security of our information technology systems could materially and adversely affect our business or reputation We rely on information technology systems throughout our Company to keep financial records and customer data process orders manage inventory coordinate shipments to customers maintain confidential and proprietary information assist in semiconductor engineering and other technical activities and operate other critical functions such as Internet connectivity network communications and email Our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages hardware failures telecommunication failures user errors catastrophes or other unforeseen events If we were to experience a prolonged disruption in the information technology systems that involve our internal communications or our interactions with customers or suppliers it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs which could adversely affect our business We may also be subject to security breaches caused by computer viruses illegal breakins or hacking sabotage or acts of vandalism by third parties Our security measures or those of our third party service providers may not detect or prevent security breaches In addition we provide our confidential and proprietary information to our strategic partners in certain cases where doing so is necessary to conduct our business While we employ confidentiality agreements to protect such information nonetheless those third parties may also be subject to security breaches or otherwise compromise the protection of such information Security breaches of our information technology systems or those of our partners could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential and proprietary information belonging to us or to our employees partners customers or suppliers which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage If we do not retain our key personnel our ability to execute our business strategy will be adversely affected Our continued success depends to a significant extent upon the recruitment retention and effective succession of our executive officers and key management and technical personnel particularly our experienced engineers The competition for these employees is intense The loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results In addition there could be a material adverse effect on our business should the turnover rates for engineers and other key personnel increase significantly or if we are unable to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel We do not maintain any key person life insurance policy on any of our officers or employees To remain competitive we may need to invest in or acquire other companies purchase or license technology from third parties or enter into other strategic transactions in order to introduce new products or enhance our existing products An element of our business strategy involves expansion through the acquisitions of businesses assets products or technologies that allow us to complement our existing product offerings diversify our product portfolio expand our market coverage increase our engineering workforce or enhance our technological capabilities We may not be able to find businesses that have the technology or resources we need and if we find such businesses we may not be able to invest in purchase or license the technology or resources on commercially favorable terms or at all Acquisitions investments and technology licenses are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons including the cost of potential transactions competition among prospective buyers and licensees the need for regulatory approvals and difficulties related to integration efforts In addition investments in earlytolate stage private companies are subject to a risk of a partial or total loss of our investment 17 Both in the US and abroad governmental regulation of acquisitions including antitrust reviews and approvals has become more complex increasing the costs and risks of undertaking and consummating significant acquisitions In order to finance a potential transaction we may need to raise additional funds by issuing securities or borrowing money We may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms and the sale of our stock may result in the dilution of our existing shareholders or the issuance of securities with rights that are superior to the rights of our common shareholders Acquisitions also involve a number of risks including  difficulty or delay integrating acquired technologies operations and personnel with our existing businesses  diversion of managements attention in connection with both negotiating the transaction and integrating the assets  strain on managerial and operational resources as management tries to oversee larger or more complex operations  the future funding requirements for acquired companies which may be significant  potential loss of key employees  exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies  higher than expected or unexpected costs relating to or associated with an acquisition and integration of assets  difficulty realizing synergies and growth prospects of an acquisition in a timely manner or at all and  increased risk of costly and timeconsuming litigation If we are unable to successfully address these risks we may not realize some or all of the expected benefits of the acquisition which may have an adverse effect on our business strategy plans and operating results We rely on supplies services and manufacturing capacity located in geologically unstable areas which could affect our ability to produce products We like many companies in the semiconductor industry rely on supplies services internal manufacturing capacity wafer fabrication foundries and other subcontractors in geologically unstable locations around the world Earthquakes tsunamis flooding or other natural disasters may disrupt local semiconductorrelated businesses and adversely affect manufacturing capacity availability and cost of key raw materials utilities and equipment and availability of key services including transport of our products worldwide Our insurance may not adequately cover losses resulting from such disruptions Any prolonged inability to utilize one of our manufacturing facilities or those of our subcontractors or thirdparty wafer fabrication foundries as a result of fire flood natural disaster unavailability of utilities or otherwise could result in a temporary or permanent loss of customers for affected products which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition We are exposed to business economic political legal regulatory and other risks through our significant worldwide operations which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations We have significant operations and manufacturing facilities outside the United States including in Ireland and the Philippines A significant portion of our revenue is derived from customers in international markets and we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue in the future Risks associated with our international business operations include the following  political legal and economic changes or instability and civil unrest in foreign markets  currency conversion risks and exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations  limitations on the repatriation of earnings  trade and travel restrictions or government sanctions including restrictions imposed by the US government on trading with parties in foreign countries  complex and varying government regulations and legal standards particularly with respect to price protection competition practices export control regulations and restrictions customs and tax requirements antiboycott regulations data privacy intellectual property anticorruption and environmental compliance including US customs and export regulations and restrictions including International Traffic in Arms Regulations and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act  economic disruption from terrorism and threats of terrorism and the response to them by the US and its allies  increased managerial complexities including different employment practices and labor issues 18  greater difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights and weaker laws protecting such rights  natural disasters or pandemics  transportation disruptions and delays and increases in labor and transportation costs  changes to foreign taxes tariffs and freight rates  fluctuations in raw material costs and energy costs  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collections and longer collection periods and  costs associated with our foreign defined benefit pension plans Any of these risks or any other risks related to international business operations could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations Many of these risks are present in China While we expect to continue to expand our business and operations in China our success in the Chinese markets may be adversely affected by Chinas continuously evolving policies laws and regulations including those relating to taxation import and export tariffs or restrictions currency controls antitrust the environment indigenous innovation and the promotion of a domestic semiconductor industry and intellectual property rights and enforcement and protection of those rights Enforcement of existing laws or agreements may be inconsistent In addition changes in the political environment governmental policies international trade policies and relations or USChina relations could result in revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement exposure of our proprietary intellectual property increased taxation and restrictions on imports import duties or currency revaluations which could have an adverse effect on our business plans and operating results At October 29 2016 our principal source of liquidity was 41 billion of cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments of which approximately 7258 million was held in the United States and the remaining balance was held outside the United States in various foreign subsidiaries As we intend to reinvest substantially all of our foreign earnings indefinitely this cash held outside the United States is not available to meet certain aspects of our cash requirements in the United States We require a substantial amount of cash in the United States for operating requirements stock repurchases cash dividends and acquisitions If we are unable to address our US cash requirements through operations borrowings under our current credit facility future debt or equity offerings or other sources of cash obtained at an acceptable cost it may be necessary for us to consider repatriation of earnings that are indefinitely reinvested and we may be required to pay additional taxes under current tax laws which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition Our operating results are dependent on the performance of independent distributors A significant portion of our sales are through independent distributors that are not under our control These independent distributors generally represent product lines offered by several companies and thus could reduce their sales efforts applied to our products or they could terminate their representation of us We generally do not require letters of credit from our distributors and are not protected against accounts receivable default or declarations of bankruptcy by these distributors Our inability to collect open accounts receivable could adversely affect our operating results Termination of a significant distributor or a group of distributors whether at our initiative or the distributors initiative or through consolidation in the distribution industry could disrupt our current business and if we are unable to find suitable replacements our operating results could be adversely affected We are subject to environmental health and safety EHS regulations which could increase our expenses and affect our operating results Our industry is subject to EHS requirements particularly those environmental requirements that control and restrict the sourcing use transportation emission discharge storage and disposal of certain chemicals minerals elements and materials used or produced in the semiconductor manufacturing process Public attention to environmental sustainability and social responsibility concerns continues to increase and our customers routinely include stringent environmental and other standards in their contracts with us Changes in EHS laws or regulations may require us to invest in costly equipment or alter the way our products are made and may adversely affect the sourcing supply and pricing of materials used in our products In addition we use hazardous and other regulated materials that subject us to risks of strict liability for damages caused by potential or actual releases of such materials Any failure to control such materials adequately or to comply with existing or future EHS statutory or regulatory standards requirements or contractual obligations could result in liability for damages and remediation the imposition of regulatory penalties and civil and criminal fines the suspension or termination of the development manufacture sale or use of certain of our products changes to our manufacturing processes or a need to substitute materials that may cost more or be less available damage to our reputation andor increased expenses associated with compliance each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 19 If we fail to comply with government contracting regulations we could suffer a loss of revenue or incur price adjustments or other penalties Some of our revenue is derived from contracts with agencies of the United States government and subcontracts with its prime contractors As a United States government contractor or subcontractor we are subject to federal contracting regulations including the Federal Acquisition Regulations which govern the allowability of costs incurred by us in the performance of United States government contracts Certain contract pricing is based on estimated direct and indirect costs which are subject to change Additionally the United States government is entitled after final payment on certain negotiated contracts to examine all of our cost records with respect to such contracts and to seek a downward adjustment to the price of the contract if it determines that we failed to furnish complete accurate and current cost or pricing data in connection with the negotiation of the price of the contract In connection with our United States government business we are also subject to government audits and to review and approval of our policies procedures and internal controls for compliance with procurement regulations and applicable laws In certain circumstances if we do not comply with the terms of a contract or with regulations or statutes we could be subject to downward contract price adjustments or refund obligations or could in extreme circumstances be assessed civil and criminal penalties or be debarred or suspended from obtaining future contracts for a specified period of time Any such suspension or debarment or other sanction could have an adverse effect on our business Under some of our government subcontracts we are required to maintain secure facilities and to obtain security clearances for personnel involved in performance of the contract in compliance with applicable federal standards If we were unable to comply with these requirements or if personnel critical to our performance of these contracts were unable to obtain or maintain their security clearances we might be unable to perform these contracts or compete for other projects of this nature which could adversely affect our revenue If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow we may not be able to service our debt obligations including making payments on our outstanding senior unsecured notes In June 2013 we issued in a public offering 5000 million aggregate principal amount of 2875 senior unsecured notes due June 1 2023 the 2023 Notes In December 2015 we issued in a public offering 8500 million aggregate principal amount of 39 senior unsecured notes due December 15 2025 the 2025 Notes and 4000 million aggregate principal amount of 53 senior unsecured notes due December 15 2045 the 2045 Notes and together with the 2023 Notes and the 2025 Notes the Notes Our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness when due depends upon our future performance which will be subject to general economic conditions industry cycles and financial business and other factors affecting our consolidated operations many of which are beyond our control If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our outstanding debt we may be required to among other things  seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets  refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness including the Notes  borrow under our existing revolving credit facility  divert funds that would otherwise be invested in our operations  repatriate earnings at higher tax rates that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign locations  sell selected assets or  reduce or delay planned capital expenditures or operating expenditures Such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt including the Notes which could negatively impact our financial results In addition any such financing refinancing or sale of assets might not be possible on economically favorable terms Restrictions in our revolving credit facility and outstanding debt instruments may limit our activities Our current revolving credit facility and the Notes impose and future debt instruments to which we may become subject may impose restrictions that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit our Company including to undertake certain transactions to create certain liens on our assets and to incur certain subsidiary indebtedness Our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates interest rates changes in technology and changes in the level of competition In addition our revolving credit facility requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios If we breach any of the covenants under our revolving credit facility the indentures governing the Notes the Term Loan Facility or any future debt instruments to which we may become subject and do 20 not obtain appropriate waivers then subject to applicable cure periods our outstanding indebtedness thereunder could be declared immediately due and payable or we may be restricted from further borrowing under our revolving credit facility Our stock price may be volatile The market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past and may be volatile in the future as it may be significantly affected by factors including  global economic conditions generally  crises in global credit debt and financial markets  actual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and operating results  changes in financial estimates or other statements made by securities analysts or others in analyst reports or other publications or our failure to perform in line with those estimates or statements or our published guidance  changes in market valuations of other semiconductor companies  rumors and speculation in the press investment community or on social media about us or other companies in our industry  announcements by us or our competitors of significant new products technical innovations material transactions acquisitions or dispositions litigation capital commitments or revised earnings estimates  departures of key personnel  alleged noncompliance with laws regulations or ethics standards by us or any of our employees officers or directors and  negative media publicity targeting us or our suppliers customers or competitors The stock market has historically experienced volatility especially within the semiconductor industry that often has been unrelated to the performance of particular companies These market fluctuations may cause our stock price to fall regardless of our
