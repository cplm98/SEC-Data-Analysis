PART I Item 1  Business The Company Amcor plc ARBN 630 385 278 is a holding company originally incorporated under the name Arctic Jersey Limited as a limited company under the Laws of the Bailiwick of Jersey in July 2018 in order to effect the Companys combination with Bemis Company Inc On October 10 2018 Arctic Jersey Limited was renamed Amcor plc and became a public limited company incorporated under the Laws of the Bailiwick of Jersey Bemis Company Inc Merger On June 11 2019 we completed the acquisition of Bemis Company Inc Bemis a global manufacturer of flexible packaging products pursuant to the definitive merger agreement the Agreement between Amcor Limited and Bemis dated August 6 2018 Under the terms of the Agreement Bemis shareholders received 51 Amcor shares for each share of Bemis stock and Amcor shareholders received one Amcor CHESS Depositary Instrument CDI for each share of Amcor Limited stock issued and outstanding Upon completion of the transaction the Amcor shares were registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC and traded on the New York Stock Exchange NYSE under the symbol AMCR and the CDIs representing our shares on the Australian Securities Exchange ASX are traded under the symbol AMC In addition Amcor Limited shares were delisted from the ASX and Bemis shares were delisted from the NYSE Business Strategy Strategy Our strategy consists of three components a focused portfolio differentiated capabilities and our aspiration to be THE leading global packaging company To fulfill our aspiration we are determined to win for our customers employees shareholders and the environment Focused portfolio Our portfolio of businesses share some important characteristics  A focus on primary packaging for fastmoving consumer goods  good industry structure  attractive relative growth and  multiple paths for us to win from our leadership position scale and other competitive advantages These criteria have led us to the focused portfolio of strong businesses we have today across flexible and rigid packaging specialty cartons and closures Differentiated capabilities  The Amcor Way describes the capabilities deployed consistently across Amcor that enable us to get leverage across our portfolio Talent Commercial Excellence Operational Leadership Innovation and Cash and Capital Discipline Shareholder value creation Through our portfolio of focused business and differentiated capabilities we generate strong cash flow and redeploy cash to consistently create superior customer value The defensive nature of our end markets mean that yeartoyear volatility should be relatively low measured on a constant currency basis Over time value creation has been strong and consistent through paying dividends and growing the base business organically in a defensive set of end markets and pursuing targeted acquisitions or by returning cash to shareholders via share buybacks 6 Segment Information Accounting Standards Codification ASC 280 Segment Reporting establishes the standards for reporting information about segments in financial statements In applying the criteria set forth in ASC 280 the Company has determined it has two reporting segments Flexibles and Rigid Packaging The reporting segments produce flexible packaging rigid packaging specialty cartons and closure products which are sold to customers participating in a range of attractive end use areas throughout Europe North America Latin America Africa and the Asia Pacific regions Refer to Note 20 Segments of the notes to consolidated financial statements for financial information about reporting segments Flexibles Segment The Flexibles Segment develops and supplies flexible packaging globally With approximately 40000 employees at 181 principal manufacturing facilities in 39 countries as of June 30 2020 the Flexibles Segment is one of the worlds largest suppliers of plastic aluminum and fiber based flexible packaging In fiscal year 2020 Flexibles accounted for approximately 78 of the Companys consolidated net sales Rigid Packaging Segment The Rigid Packaging Segment manufacturers rigid packaging containers and related products in the Americas As of June 30 2020 the Rigid Packaging Segment employed approximately 6000 employees at 50 principal manufacturing facilities in 11 countries In fiscal year 2020 Rigid Packaging accounted for approximately 22 of the Companys consolidated net sales Marketing Distribution and Competition Our sales are made through a variety of distribution channels but primarily through our direct sales force Sales offices and plants are located throughout Europe North America Latin America Africa and AsiaPacific regions to provide prompt and economical service to thousands of customers Our technically trained sales force is supported by product development engineers design technicians field service technicians and a customer service organization We did not have sales to a single customer that exceeded 10 of consolidated net sales for fiscal year 2020 Sales to PepsiCo and its subsidiaries accounted for approximately 111 and 110 of our sales in fiscal years 2019 and 2018 respectively Business arrangements with PepsiCo are aggregated across a number of separate contracts in disparate locations and any change in these business arrangements would typically occur over a period of time The major markets in which we sell our products historically have been and continue to be highly competitive Areas of competition include service innovation quality and price Competitors include AptarGroup Inc Ball Corporation Berry Global Group Inc CCL Industries Inc Crown Holdings Inc Graphic Packaging Holding Company Huhtamaki Oyj International Paper Company MayrMelnhof Karton AG OI Glass Inc Sealed Air Corporation Silgan Holdings Inc Sonoco Products Company and WestRock Company and a variety of privately held companies We consider ourselves to be a significant participant in the markets in which we serve however due to the diversity of our business our precise competitive position in these markets is not reasonably determinable Backlog Working capital fluctuates throughout the year in relation to business volume and other marketplace conditions We maintain inventory levels that provide a reasonable balance between obtaining raw materials at favorable prices and maintaining adequate inventory levels to enable us to fulfill our commitment to promptly fill customer orders Manufacturing backlogs are not a significant factor in the industries in which we operate Raw Materials Polymer resins and films paper inks adhesives aluminum and chemicals constitute the major raw materials we use These are purchased from a variety of global industry sources and we are not significantly dependent on any one supplier for our raw materials While temporary industrywide shortages of raw materials may occur we expect to continue to successfully manage raw material supplies without significant supply interruptions Currently raw materials are readily available but pricing may fluctuate 7 Intellectual Property We are the owner or licensee of a number of United States and other country patents and patent applications that relate to our products manufacturing processes and equipment We have a number of trademarks and trademark registrations in the United States and in other countries We also keep certain technology and processes as trade secrets Our patents licenses and trademarks collectively provide a competitive advantage However the loss of any single patent or license alone would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations as a whole or those of our reporting segments Patents patent applications and license agreements will expire or terminate over time by operation of law in accordance with their terms or otherwise Sustainability Innovation and Environmental Laws and Regulations We believe there will always be a role for the primary packages made by Amcor Packaging protects and preserves food and healthcare products and reduces the carbon footprint and waste of products It extends shelf life and reduces food and other product loss across a range of distribution channels Consumers want cost effective convenient and easy to use packaging which also has an end of life solution to reduce waste We believe responsible packaging is the answer to achieve less waste through innovative packaging design waste management infrastructure and consumer participation Amcor is committed to responsible packaging and we see this as being integral to our success In January 2018 we became the first global packaging company pledging to develop all of our packaging to be recyclable or reusable by 2025 to significantly increase our use of recycled materials and to work with others to drive greater recycling of packaging around the world We are highly regarded for our innovation capabilities and we have thousands of active patents We collaborate with customers suppliers and innovators to create industryleading solutions and with stakeholders to increase available infrastructure for waste collection sorting and recycling and to inform consumers about the environmental implications of their packaging We are uniquely positioned to lead the way in the development of more sustainable or environmentally friendly packaging Addressing the need for and increasing the supply of responsible packaging is one of the most important growth opportunities for Amcor Our operations and the real property we own or lease are subject to broad environmental laws and regulations by multiple jurisdictions These laws and regulations pertain to the discharge of certain materials into the environment handling and disposition of waste and cleanup of contaminated soil and ground water as well as various other protections of the environment We believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations based on implementation of our Environmental Health and Safety Management System and regular audits of those processes and systems However we cannot predict with certainty that we will not in the future incur liability with respect to noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations due to contamination of sites formerly or currently owned or operated by us including contamination caused by prior owners and operators of such sites or the offsite disposal of regulated materials which could be material In addition these laws and regulations are constantly changing and we cannot always anticipate these changes Refer to Note 19 Contingencies and Legal Proceedings of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information about legal proceedings For a more detailed description of the various laws and regulations that affect our business see Item 1A Risk Factors Employees As of June 30 2020 we employed approximately 47000 people worldwide with approximately 42 of those employees being covered by collective bargaining agreements Our relations with employees under collective bargaining agreements remain satisfactory and there have been no significant work stoppages or other labor disputes during the past three years For more on collective bargaining and labor disputes see Item 1A  Risk Factors Seasonal Factors The business of each of the reporting segments is not seasonal to any material extent Research and Development Refer to Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information about our research and development expenditures and policies 8 Information about our Executive Officers The following sets forth the name age and business experience for at

not including the information contained on our website as part of or incorporating it by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10K 9 Item 1A  Risk Factors The following factors as well as factors described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10K or in other filings by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission could adversely affect the Companys consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows Other factors not presently known to us or that we presently believe are not material could also affect our business operations and financial results Strategic Risks Changes in Consumer Demand  We are exposed to changes in consumer demand patterns and customer requirements in numerous industries Sales of our products and services depend heavily on the volume of sales made by our customers to consumers Consequently changes in consumer preferences for products in the industries that we serve or the packaging formats in which such products are delivered whether as a result of changes in cost convenience or health environmental and social concerns and perceptions may result in a decline in the demand for certain of our products or the obsolescence of some of our existing products Although we have adopted certain strategies designed to mitigate the impact of declining sales there is no guarantee that such strategies will be successful or will offset a decline in demand Furthermore any new products that we produce may not meet sales or margin expectations due to many factors including our inability to accurately predict customer demand end user preferences or movements in industry standards or to develop products that meet consumer demand in a timely and costeffective manner Changing preferences for products and packaging formats may result in increased demand for other products we produce However to the extent changing preferences are not offset by demand for new or alternative products changes to consumer preferences could have an adverse effect on our business cash flow financial condition and results of operations Key Customers and Customer Consolidation  The loss of key customers a reduction in their production requirements or consolidation among key customers could have a significant adverse impact on our sales revenue and profitability Relationships with our customers are fundamental to our success particularly given the nature of the packaging industry and the other supply choices available to customers From time to time a single customer depending on the current status and volumes of a number of separate contracts in disparate locations may account for 10 or more of our revenue Sales to our largest customer accounted for approximately 11 of our total net sales for fiscal years 2019 and 2018 We did not have sales to a single customer that exceeded 10 of our net sales in 2020 or sales to any other customer that accounted for more than 10 of net sales in these fiscal periods Customer concentration can be even more pronounced within certain business units Consequently the loss of any of our key customers or any significant reduction in their production requirements or an adverse change in the terms of our supply agreements with them could reduce our sales revenue and net profit There can be no guarantee that our key customers will not in the future seek to source some or all of their products or services from competitors change to alternative forms of packaging begin manufacturing their packaging products inhouse or seek to renew their business with us on terms less favorable than before Any loss change or other adverse event related to our key customer relationships could have an adverse effect on our business cash flow financial condition and results of operations which effect may be material In addition over recent years certain of our customers have acquired companies with similar or complementary product lines This consolidation has increased the concentration of our business with these customers Such consolidation may be accompanied by pressure from customers for lower prices reflecting the increase in the total volume of products purchased or the elimination of a price differential between the acquiring customer and the company acquired While we have generally been successful at managing customer consolidations increased pricing pressures from our customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations Competition  We face significant competition in the industries and regions in which we operate which could adversely affect our business We operate in highly competitive geographies and end use areas each with varying barriers to entry industry structures and competitive behavior We regularly bid for new and continuing business in the industries and regions in which 10 we operate and we continue to change in response to consumer demand We cannot predict with certainty the changes that may affect our competitiveness The loss of business from our larger customers or the renewal of business on less favorable terms may have a significant impact on our operating results In addition our competitors may develop a disruptive technology or other technological innovations that could increase their ability to compete for our current or potential customers No assurance can be given that the actions of established or potential competitors will not have an adverse effect on our ability to implement our plans and on our business cash flow financial condition and results of operations Expanding Our Current Business  We may be unable to expand our current business effectively through either organic growth including product innovation or acquisitions Our business strategy includes both organic expansion of our existing operations particularly through efforts to strengthen and expand relationships with customers in emerging markets product innovation and expansion through acquisitions However we may not be able to execute our strategy effectively for reasons within and outside our control Our ability to grow organically may be limited by among other things extensive saturation in the locations in which we operate or a change or reduction in our customers growth plans due to changing economic conditions strategic priorities or otherwise For many of our businesses organic growth depends on product innovation new product development and timely responses to changing consumer demands and preferences Consequently failure to develop new or improved products in response to changing consumer preferences in a timely manner may hinder our growth potential affect our competitive position and adversely affect our business and results of operations Additionally over the past decade we have pursued growth through acquisitions including our acquisition of Bemis in 2019 There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition targets in the right geographic regions and with the right participation strategy in the future or to complete such acquisitions on acceptable terms or at all Other companies in the industries and regions in which we operate have similar investment and acquisition strategies to us resulting in competition for a limited pool of potential acquisition targets Due in part to that competition as well as the recent low interest rate environment which has made debt funding more appealing and accessible price multiples for potential targets are currently higher than their historical averages If as a result of these and other factors we are unable to identify acquisition targets that meet our investment criteria and close such transactions on acceptable terms our potential for growth by way of acquisition may be restricted which could have an adverse effect on achievement of our strategy and the resulting expected financial benefits Integration  We may face challenges with integrating acquisitions and achieving the financial and other results anticipated at the time of acquisition We may face challenges in integrating our acquisitions with our existing operations These challenges could include difficulty in integrating or consolidating business processes and systems and challenges with integrating the business cultures In addition the process of integrating operations could result in an interruption of normal business operations We generally expect that we will realize synergy cost savings and other financial and operating benefits from our acquisitions For example we expect the Bemis acquisition in 2019 will generate estimated pretax annual net cost synergies by the end of the third year of approximately 180 million from procurement manufacturing and general and administrative efficiencies While we are currently on track to achieve the targeted Bemis synergies we cannot predict with certainty that the full savings will be realized or current savings will be sustained If we are not able to successfully integrate our acquisitions and achieve the expected synergy cost savings the anticipated benefits of the transaction may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected or involve more costs to do so Intellectual Property  Challenges to or the loss of our intellectual property rights could have an adverse impact on our ability to compete effectively Our ability to compete effectively depends in part on our ability to protect and maintain the proprietary nature of our owned and licensed intellectual property We own a number of patents on our products aspects of our products methods of use andor methods of manufacturing and we own or have licenses to use the material trademark and trade name rights used in connection with the packaging marketing and distribution of our major products We also rely on trade secrets knowhow and other unpatented proprietary technology We attempt to protect and restrict access to our intellectual property and proprietary information by relying on the patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws of the countries in which we operate as well as nondisclosure agreements However it may be possible for a third party to obtain our information without our authorization independently develop similar technologies or breach a nondisclosure agreement entered into with us Furthermore many of 11 the countries in which we operate particularly the emerging markets do not have intellectual property laws that protect proprietary rights as fully as the laws of the more developed jurisdictions in which we operate such as the United States and the European Union The use of our intellectual property by someone else without our authorization could reduce certain of our competitive advantages cause us to lose sales or otherwise harm our business The costs associated with protecting our intellectual property rights could also adversely impact our business Similarly while we have not received any significant claims from third parties suggesting that we may be infringing on their intellectual property rights there can be no assurance that we will not receive such claims in the future If we were held liable for a claim of infringement we could be required to pay damages obtain licenses or cease making or selling certain products Intellectual property litigation which could result in substantial cost to us and divert the attention of management may be necessary to protect our trade secrets or proprietary technology or for us to defend against claimed infringement of the rights of others and to determine the scope and validity of others proprietary rights We may not prevail in any such litigation and if we are unsuccessful we may not be able to obtain any necessary licenses on reasonable terms or at all Failure to protect our patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights could have an adverse effect on our business cash flow financial condition and results of operations Operational Risks Global Health Outbreaks  Our business and operations may be adversely affected by the recent 2019 Novel Coronavirus COVID19 outbreak or other similar outbreaks Our business and financial results may be negatively impacted by outbreaks of contagious diseases including the recent outbreak of the coronavirus that was first detected in Wuhan China in December 2019 As a result of the COVID19 outbreak governmental authorities have implemented and are continuing to implement numerous and constantly evolving measures to try to contain the virus such as travel bans and restrictions limitations on gatherings quarantines shelterinplace orders and business shutdowns Measures providing for business shutdowns generally exclude essential services and the critical infrastructure supporting the essential services We have experienced minimal disruptions to our operations to date as we have largely been deemed as providing essential services However we have experienced volatility in customer order patterns in the second half of our fiscal year 2020 and could continue to experience significant volatility in the demand for our products in the future We have also impaired an equity method investment by 256 million in the fourth quarter in part partially due to general market declines associated with the pandemic See Note 7 Equity Method Investments of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the impairment The outbreak has in the past and could in the future result in the temporary closure of our facilities the facilities of our suppliers or other vendors in our supply chain In limited cases to date certain customers have shut down their operations temporarily to deal with the outbreak within their facilities which has impacted their demand and we may continue to experience the volatility in demand from temporary customer shutdowns In addition the coronavirus has significantly impacted and may further impact the economies and financial markets of affected countries including negatively impacting economic growth the proper functioning of capital markets foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates The coronavirus may result in a prolonged economic downturn such as increased unemployment decreases in capital spending business shutdowns or economic recessions which could negatively affect demand for our customers products Despite our efforts to manage these impacts the extent to which the coronavirus or other outbreaks impact our business and operations including our ability to secure financing at attractive rates is unknown and the effect could be material Global Operations  Challenging current and future global economic conditions have had and may continue to have a negative impact on our business operations and financial results Demand for our products and services is dependent on consumer demand for our packaging products including packaged food beverage healthcare personal care agribusiness industrial and other consumer goods As a result general economic downturns in our key geographic regions and globally can adversely affect our business operations and financial results The current global economic challenges including relatively high levels of unemployment in certain areas in which we operate low economic growth and difficulties associated with managing rising debt levels and related economic volatility in certain economies are likely to continue to put pressure on the global economy and our business The COVID19 pandemic has increased volatility in world economies When challenging economic conditions exist our customers may delay decrease or cancel purchases from us and may also delay payment or fail to pay us altogether Suppliers may have difficulty filling our orders and distributors may have difficulty getting our products to customers which may affect our ability to meet customer demands and result in a loss of business Weakened global economic conditions may also result in unfavorable changes in our product prices and product mix and lower profit margins All of these factors could have an adverse effect on our business cash flow financial condition and results of operations which effect may be material 12 Political uncertainty may also contribute to the general economic conditions in one or more markets in which we operate For example the United Kingdoms exit from the European Union has resulted in uncertainty regarding the longterm nature of the United Kingdoms relationship with the European Union causing significant volatility in global financial markets and altering the conduct of market participants Political developments such as this could potentially disrupt the markets we serve and the tax jurisdictions in which we operate and may cause us to lose customers suppliers and employees and adversely impact profitability International Operations  Our international operations subject us to various risks that could adversely affect our business operations and financial results We have operations throughout the world including facilities located in emerging markets In fiscal year 2020 approximately 74 of our sales revenue came from developed markets and 26 came from emerging markets We expect to continue to expand our operations in the future particularly in the emerging markets Management of global operations is extremely complex particularly given the often substantial differences in the cultural political and regulatory environments of the countries in which we operate In addition many of the countries in which we operate including Argentina Brazil China and India and other emerging markets have underdeveloped or developing legal regulatory or political systems which are subject to dynamic change and civil unrest The profitability of our operations may be adversely impacted by among other things  changes in applicable fiscal or regulatory regimes  changes in or difficulties in interpreting and complying with local laws and regulations including tax labor foreign investment and foreign exchange control laws  nullification modification or renegotiation of or difficulties or delays in enforcing contracts with clients or joint venture partners that are subject to local law  reversal of current political judicial or administrative policies encouraging foreign investment or foreign trade or relating to the use of local agents representatives or partners in the relevant jurisdictions  pandemics such as COVID19 impacting various regions of the world unequally or  changes in exchange rates and inflation including hyperinflation which may be further exacerbated by the COVID19 pandemic Further sustained periods of legal regulatory or political instability in the emerging markets in which we operate could have an adverse effect on our business cash flow financial condition and results of operations which effect may be material The international scope of our operations which includes limited sales of our products to entities located in countries subject to certain economic sanctions administered by the US Office of Foreign Assets Control the US Department of State the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and other applicable national and supranational organizations collectively Sanctions and operations in certain countries that are from time to time subject to Sanctions also requires us to maintain internal processes and control procedures Failure to do so could result in breach by our employees of various laws and regulations including those relating to money laundering corruption export control fraud bribery insider trading antitrust competition and economic sanctions whether due to a lack of integrity or awareness or otherwise Any such breach could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and result in reputational damage to our business which effect may be material Raw Materials  Price fluctuations or shortages in the availability of raw materials energy and other inputs could adversely affect our business As a manufacturer of packaging products our sales and profitability are dependent on the availability and cost of raw materials and labor and other inputs including energy All of the raw materials we use are purchased from third parties and our primary inputs include polymer resins and films inks and solvents aluminum and fiberbased carton board Prices for these raw materials are subject to substantial fluctuations that are beyond our control due to factors such as changing economic conditions pandemics such as the COVID19 pandemic currency and commodity price fluctuations resource availability transportation costs weather conditions and natural disasters political unrest and instability and other factors impacting supply and demand pressures Increases in costs can have an adverse effect on our business and financial results Although we seek to mitigate these risks through various strategies including by entering into contracts with certain customers which permit certain price adjustments to reflect increased raw material costs or by otherwise seeking to increase our prices to offset increases in raw 13 material costs there is no guarantee that we will be able to anticipate or mitigate commodity and input price movements there may be delays in adjusting prices to correspond with underlying raw material costs and any failure to anticipate or mitigate against such movements could have an adverse effect on our business cash flow financial condition and results of operations which effect may be material Commercial Risks  We are subject to production supply and other commercial risks including counterparty credit risks which may be exacerbated in times of economic downturn We face a number of commercial risks including i operational disruption such as mechanical or technology failures or forced closures due to pandemics such as the COVID19 pandemic each of which could in turn lead to production loss andor increased costs ii shortages in manufacturing inputs due to the loss of key suppliers or their inability to supply inputs and iii risks associated with development projects such as cost overruns and delays In addition many of the geographic areas where our production is located and where we conduct business may be affected by natural disasters including earthquakes snowstorms hurricanes forest fires and flooding Any unplanned plant downtime at any of our facilities would likely result in unabsorbed fixed costs that could negatively impact our results of operations for the period in which it experienced the downtime Supply shortages or disruptions in our supply chain including as a result of sourcing materials from a single supplier or those that may occur related to the COVID19 pandemic or other natural disasters could affect our ability to obtain timely delivery of raw materials equipment and other supplies and in turn adversely impact our ability to supply products to our customers Such disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results In response to the COVID19 pandemic we have implemented employee safety measures across all our supply chain facilities including proper hygiene social distancing and temporary screening which at a minimum are in compliance with local government regulations These measures may not be sufficient to prevent the spread of COVID19 among our employees Illness travel restrictions absenteeism or other workforce disruptions could negatively impact our supply chain manufacturing distribution or other business activities Additionally the insolvency of or contractual default by any of our customers suppliers and financial institutions such as banks and insurance providers may have a significant adverse effect on our operations and financial condition Such risks are exacerbated in times of economic volatility such as economic volatility caused by the COVID19 pandemic either globally or in the geographies and industries in which our customers operate If a counterparty defaults on a payment obligation to us we may be unable to collect the amounts owed and some or all of these outstanding amounts may need to be written off If a counterparty becomes insolvent or is otherwise unable to meet its obligations in connection with a particular project we may need to find a replacement to fulfill that partys obligations or alternatively fulfill those obligations ourself which is likely to be more expensive The occurrence of any of these risks including any default by our counterparties could have an adverse effect on our business cash flow financial condition and results of operations which effect may be material and result in a competitive disadvantage Information technology  A failure or disruption in our information technology systems could disrupt our operations compromise customer employee vendor and other data and could negatively affect our business We rely on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and control systems to securely manage operations and various business functions and on various technologies to process store and report information about our business and to interact with customers vendors and employees around the world In addition our information systems increasingly rely on cloud solutions which require different security measures These measures cover technical changes to our network security organization and governance changes as well as alignment of third party vendors on market standards As with all large systems our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage disruption information loss or shutdown due to power outages failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software hardware failures computer viruses cyberattacks catastrophic events telecommunications failures user errors unauthorized access and malicious or accidental destruction or theft of information or functionality We also maintain and have access to sensitive confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security laws regulations and customer controls Despite our efforts to protect such information our facilities and systems and those of our customers and thirdparty service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches misplaced or lost data and programming andor user errors that could lead to the compromising of sensitive confidential or personal data or information Information system damages disruptions shutdowns or compromises could result in production downtimes and operational disruptions transaction errors loss of customers and business opportunities violation of privacy laws and legal liability regulatory fines penalties or intervention negative publicity resulting in reputational damage reimbursement or compensatory payments and other costs any of which could have an adverse effect on our business cash flow financial condition and results 14 of operations which affect may be material and result in a competitive disadvantage Although we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures our systems networks products and services remain potentially vulnerable to advanced and persistent threats Attracting and retaining key personnel  If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel we may be adversely affected Our continued success depends in large part on our ability to identify attract motivate train and retain qualified personnel in key functions and geographic areas Losing the services of key employees in any of our operations could make it difficult to meet our objectives There can be no assurance we will be able to recruit train assimilate motivate and retain employees in the future who actively promote and meet the standards of our culture Operational hazards  We are subject to costs and liabilities related to current and future environmental and health and safety laws and regulations that could adversely affect our business We are required to comply with environmental and health and safety laws rules and regulations in each of the countries in which we do business Many of our products come into contact with the food and beverages they package and therefore we are also subject to certain local and international standards related to such products Compliance with these laws and regulations can require significant expenditure of financial and employee resources In addition changes to such laws regulations and standards are made or proposed regularly and some of the proposals if adopted might directly or indirectly result in a material reduction in the operating results of one or more of our operating units For instance an increase in legislation with respect to litter related to plastic packaging or related recycling programs may cause legislators in some countries and regions in which our products are sold to consider banning or limiting certain packaging formats or materials Additionally increased regulation of emissions linked to climate change including greenhouse gas carbon emissions and other climaterelated regulations could potentially increase the cost of our operations due to increased costs of compliance which may not be recoverable through adjustment of prices increased cost of fossil fuel inputs and increased cost of energy intensive raw material inputs However any such changes are uncertain and we cannot predict the amount of additional capital expenses or operating expenses that would be necessary for compliance Federal state provincial foreign and local environmental requirements relating to air soil and water quality handling discharge storage and disposal of a variety of substances and climate change are also significant factors in our business and changes to such requirements generally result in an increase to our costs of operations We may be found to have environmental liability for the costs of remediating soil or water that is or was contaminated by us or a third party at various facilities we own used or operate including facilities that may be acquired by us in the future Legal proceedings may result in the imposition of fines or penalties as well as mandated remediation programs that require substantial and in some instances unplanned capital expenditure The effects of climate change and greenhouse gas effects may adversely affect our business A number of governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating introducing regulatory change to address the impacts of climate change which where implemented may have adverse impacts on our operations or financial results We have incurred in the past and may incur in the future fines penalties and legal costs relating to environmental matters and costs relating to the damage of natural resources lost property values and toxic tort claims Provisions are raised when it is considered probable that we have some liability However because the extent of potential environmental damage and the extent of our liability for such damage is usually difficult to assess and may only be ascertained over a long period of time our actual liability in such cases may end up being substantially higher than the currently provisioned amount Accordingly additional charges could be incurred that would have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position which may be material Labor disputes  We are subject to the risk of labor disputes which could adversely affect our business Although we have not experienced any significant labor disputes in recent years there can be no assurance that we will not experience labor disputes in the future including protests and strikes which could disrupt our business operations and have an adverse effect on our business and results of operation Although we consider our relations with our employees to be good there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain a satisfactory working relationship with our employees in the future 15 Financial Risks LIBOR Indexed Borrowings  The expected phase out of LIBOR could impact the interest rates paid on our variable rate indebtedness and cause our interest expense to increase A substantial portion of our borrowing capacity bears interest at a variable rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR In July 2017 the United Kingdoms Financial Conduct Authority FCA which regulates LIBOR announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021 The US Federal Reserve in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee a steering committee comprised of large US financial institutions is considering replacing LIBOR with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR a new index calculated by shortterm repurchase agreements backed by Treasury securities Certain of our financing agreements include language to determine a replacement rate for LIBOR if necessary However if LIBOR ceases to exist we may need to renegotiate some financing agreements extending beyond 2021 that utilize LIBOR as a factor in determining the interest rate We are evaluating the potential impact of the eventual replacement of the LIBOR benchmark interest rate however we are not able to predict whether LIBOR will cease to be available after 2021 whether SOFR will become a widely accepted benchmark in place of LIBOR or what the impact of such a possible transition to SOFR may be on our business financial condition and results of operations Exchange Rates  We are exposed to foreign exchange rate risk We are subject to foreign exchange rate risk both transactional and translational which may negatively affect our financial performance Transactional foreign exchange exposures result from exchange rate fluctuations including in respect of the US dollar the Euro and other currencies including in Latin America in which our costs are denominated which may affect our business input costs and proceeds from product sales Translational foreign exchange exposures result from exchange rate fluctuations in the conversion of entity functional currencies to US dollars consistent with our reporting currency and may affect the reported value of our assets and liabilities and our income and expenses In particular our translational exposure may be impacted by movements in the exchange rate between the Euro and the Brazilian Real against the US dollar The exchange rate has varied in recent years and is subject to further movement Exchange rates between transactional currencies may change rapidly For instance the Mexican peso and the Brazilian Real have experienced significant pressures as growth and other concerns including those related to the COVID19 pandemic have weighed on the Mexican and Brazilian economies respectively In addition we have recognized foreign exchange losses related to the currency devaluation in Argentina and its designation as a highly inflationary economy under US GAAP See Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding highly inflationary accounting To the extent currency devaluation continues across our business we are likely to experience a lag in the timing to pass through US dollardenominated input costs across our business which would adversely impact our margins and profitability As such we may be exposed to future exchange rate fluctuations and such fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our reported cash flow financial condition and results of operations which effect may be material Interest rates  An increase in interest rates could reduce our reported results of operations Fluctuations in interest rates can increase borrowing costs and have an adverse impact on results of operations Accordingly increases in shortterm interest rates will directly impact the amount of interest we pay Refer to Note 13 Debt of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information about our variable rate borrowings and interest rates Credit rating  A downgrade in our credit rating could increase our borrowing costs and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations In addition to using cash provided by operations we regularly issue commercial paper drawdown bank loans and issue longterm bonds to meet our funding needs Credit rating agencies rate our debt securities on many factors including our financial results their view of the general outlook for our industry and their view of the general outlook for the global economy Actions taken by the rating agencies include maintaining upgrading or downgrading the current rating or placing us on a watch list for a possible future downgrade If rating agencies downgrade our credit rating or place us on a watch list the impacts could include reduced access to the commercial paper market an increase in the cost of our borrowings or the fees associated with our bank credit facility or an increase in the credit spread incurred when issuing debt in the capital markets 16 Refer to Item 7  Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources for more information on our credit rating profile Hedging  Failure to hedge effectively against adverse fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates could negatively impact our results of operations We are subject to the risk of rising interest rates associated with borrowing on a floatingrate basis as well as unfavorable fluctuations in foreign exchange rates Our board of directors has approved a hedging policy to manage the risk of rising interest rates The level of hedging activity undertaken may change from time to time and we may elect to change our hedging policy at any time If our hedges are not effective in mitigating our interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risks if we are underhedged or if a hedge provider defaults on their obligations under hedging arrangements it could have an adverse effect on our business cash flow financial condition and results of operations Goodwill and other intangible assets  A significant writedown of goodwill andor other intangible assets would have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations and net worth As of June 30 2020 we had 73 billion of goodwill and other intangible assets We review our goodwill balance for impairment at least once a year and whenever events or a change in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred using the business valuation methods allowed in accordance with current accounting standards These methods include the use of a discount rate to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows of our reporting units Future changes in the cost of capital expected cash flows or other factors may cause our goodwill andor other intangible assets to be impaired resulting in a noncash charge against results of operations to write down these assets for the amount of the impairment In addition if we make changes in our business strategy or if external conditions such as the COVID19 pandemic adversely affect our business operations we may be required to record an impairment charge for goodwill or intangibles which would lead to decreased assets and reduced net operating results If a significant write down is required the charge would have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations and net worth We have identified the valuation of intangible assets and goodwill as a critical accounting estimate See Item 7  Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments of this Annual Report on Form 10K Internal Controls  If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting in the future we may not be able to accurately report our financial condition results of operations or cash flows which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and as a result the value of our common stock As a newly listed NYSE public company in 2019 we elected the transition period for compliance with Section 404 of the SarbanesOxley Act Section 404 requires us to furnish a report by management on among other things the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting This assessment needs to include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting A material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control that results in more than a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis Section 404 of the SarbanesOxley Act also generally requires an attestation from our independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting However during our transition period we were exempt from Section 404 compliance until we filed our second Annual Report on Form 10K for the fiscal year ended June 30 2020 which is this Annual Report on Form 10K Amcor Limited was required to comply with reporting obligations in Australia including the preparation of its financial statements under Australian Accounting Standards AAS as adopted by the Australian Accounting Standards Board and other relevant companies law Amcor Limited was not required to comply with US GAAP Following the consummation of the Bemis acquisition we now prepare financial statements in accordance with US GAAP We identified two material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting during the conversion of our historical AAS financial statements to US GAAP The first material weakness was related to our lack of accounting staff and supervisory personnel with the appropriate level of experience in technical accounting in US GAAP and disclosure and filing requirements of a US domestic registrant We have fully remediated this material weakness as of the end of fiscal year 2020 see Item 9A Controls and Procedures for further information We also identified a second material weakness arising from deficiencies in the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls over the period end financial reporting process Specifically we did not design and maintain effective controls to verify that conflicting duties were appropriately segregated within key IT systems used in the preparation and reporting of financial information 17 We are currently in the process of remediating the second material weakness through a process to i develop and implement additional controls and procedures to reduce the number of segregation of duties conflicts within key IT systems which includes the implementation of new security roles and the automation of segregation of duties monitoring where practical ii design and implement additional compensating controls where necessary and iii develop training on segregation of duties Given that we operate many ERP systems globally this effort has targeted the largest locations with standardized systems in fiscal 2020 and will be expanded to other locations in fiscal 2021 We believe that these enhanced resources and processes including the implementation of new mitigating controls will effectively remediate the second material weakness but the material weakness will not be considered remediated until the revised controls operate for a sufficient period of time and we have concluded through testing that these controls are designed and operating effectively Failure to remediate the material weakness described above at all or within our expected timeframe or any newly identified material weaknesses could limit our ability to prevent or detect a misstatement of our financial results lead to a loss of investor confidence and have a negative impact on the trading price of our common stock Insurance  Our insurance policies including our use of a captive insurance company may not provide adequate protection against all of the risks we face We seek protection from a number of our key operational risk exposures through the purchase of insurance A significant portion of our insurance is placed in the insurance market with thirdparty reinsurers Our policies with such thirdparty reinsurers cover property damage and business interruption public and products liability and directors and officers liability Although we believe the coverage provided by such policies is consistent with industry practice they may not adequately cover certain risks and there is no guarantee that any claims made under such policies will ultimately be paid Additionally we retain a portion of our insurable risk through a captive insurance company Amcor Insurances Pte Ltd which is located in Singapore Our captive insurance company collects annual premiums from our business groups and assumes specific risks relating to property damage business interruption and liability claims The captive insurance company may be required to make payment for insurance claims which exceed the captives reserves which could have an adverse effect on our business cash flow financial condition and results of operations Legal and Compliance Risks Litigation  Litigation or regulatory developments could adversely affect our business operations and financial performance We are and in the future will likely become involved in lawsuits regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of our business Given our global footprint we are exposed to more uncertainty regarding the regulatory environment The timing of the final resolutions to lawsuits regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings is typically uncertain Additionally the possible outcomes of or resolutions to these proceedings could include adverse judgments or settlements either of which could require substantial payments In addition actions we have taken or may take or decisions we have made or may make as a consequence of the COVID19 pandemic may result in legal claims or litigation against us Refer to Item 3  Legal Proceedings of this Annual Report on Form 10K Environmental health and safety regulations  Changing government regulations in environmental health and safety matters may adversely affect our company Numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives have been passed and anticipated in response to concerns about Greenhouse Gas emissions and climate change We are a manufacturing entity that utilizes petrochemicalbased raw materials to produce many of our products Increased environmental legislation or regulation could result in higher costs for us in the form of higher raw material cost as well as energy and freight costs It is possible that certain materials might cease to be permitted to be used in our processes We could also incur additional compliance costs for monitoring and reporting emissions and for maintaining permits Additionally a sizable portion of our business comes from healthcare packaging and food and beverage packaging both highly regulated markets If we fail to comply with these regulatory requirements our results of operations could be adversely impacted Patents and proprietary technology  Our success is dependent on our ability to develop and successfully introduce new products and to develop acquire and retain intellectual property rights Our success depends in large part on our proprietary technology We rely on intellectual property rights including patents trademarks and trade secrets as well as confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish our 18 proprietary rights If we are unable to enforce our intellectual property rights our competitive position may suffer Our pending patent applications and our pending trademark registration applications may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents or trademarks In addition our patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us a significant competitive advantage We may need to spend significant resources monitoring our intellectual property rights Our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights quickly or at all Competitors might avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing noninfringing competing technologies Intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenues Risks Relating to Being a Jersey Channel Islands Company Listing Ordinary Shares Our ordinary shares are issued under the laws of Jersey Channel Islands which may not provide the level of legal certainty and transparency afforded by incorporation in a US jurisdiction and which differ in some respects to the laws applicable to other US corporations We are organized under the laws of Jersey Channel Islands a British crown dependency that is an island located off the coast of Normandy France Jersey is not a member of the European Union Jersey Channel Islands legislation regarding companies is largely based on English corporate law principles The rights of holders of our ordinary shares are governed by Jersey law including the Companies Jersey Law 1991 as amended and by the Amcor Articles of Association as may be amended from time to time These rights differ in some respects from the rights of other shareholders in corporations incorporated in the United States Further there can be no assurance that the laws of Jersey Channel Islands will not change in the future or that they will serve to protect investors in a similar fashion afforded under corporate law principles in the US which could adversely affect the rights of investors US shareholders may not be able to enforce civil liabilities against us A significant portion of our assets are located outside of the United States and several of our directors and officers are citizens or residents of jurisdictions outside of the United States As a result it may be difficult for investors to successfully serve a claim within the United States upon those nonUS directors and officers or to enforce judgments realized in the United States Judgments of US courts may not be directly enforceable outside of the US and the enforcement of judgments of US courts outside of the US including those in Australia and Jersey may be subject to limitations Investors may also have difficulties pursuing an original action brought in a court in a jurisdiction outside the US including Australia and Jersey for liabilities under the securities laws of the US Additionally our Articles of Association provide that while the Royal Court of Jersey will have nonexclusive jurisdiction over actions brought against us the Royal Court of Jersey will be the sole and exclusive forum for derivative shareholder actions actions for breach of fiduciary duty by our directors and officers actions arising out of Companies Jersey Law 1991 as amended or actions asserting a claim against our directors or officers governed by the internal affairs doctrine The exclusive forum provision would not prevent derivative shareholder actions based on claims arising under US federal securities laws from being raised in a US court and would not prevent a US court from asserting jurisdiction over such claims However there is uncertainty whether a US or Jersey court would enforce the exclusive forum provision for actions claiming breach of fiduciary duty and other claims 19 Item 1B  Unresolved Staff Comments None Item 2  Properties We consider our plants and other physical properties whether owned or leased to be suitable adequate and of sufficient
