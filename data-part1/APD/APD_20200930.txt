PART I Item 1 Business Air Products and Chemicals Inc a Delaware corporation originally founded in 1940 serves customers globally with a unique portfolio of products services and solutions that include atmospheric gases process and specialty gases equipment and services We are the worlds largest supplier of hydrogen and have built leading positions in growth markets such as helium and liquefied natural gas LNG process technology and equipment We also develop engineer build own and operate some of the worlds largest industrial gas projects including gasification projects that sustainably convert abundant natural resources into syngas for the production of highvalue power fuels and chemicals carbon capture projects and worldscale carbonfree hydrogen projects supporting global transportation and the energy transition As used in this report unless the context indicates otherwise the terms we our us the Company Air Products or registrant include controlled subsidiaries affiliates and predecessors of Air Products and our controlled subsidiaries and affiliates During the fiscal year ended 30 September 2020 fiscal year 2020 we reported our continuing operations in five reporting segments under which we managed our operations assessed performance and reported earnings Industrial Gases  Americas Industrial Gases  EMEA Europe Middle East and Africa Industrial Gases  Asia Industrial Gases  Global and Corporate and other Except as otherwise noted the description of our business below reflects our continuing operations Refer to Note 6 Discontinued Operations  to the consolidated financial statements for activity associated with discontinued operations Industrial Gases Business Our Industrial Gases business produces atmospheric gases such as oxygen nitrogen and argon process gases such as hydrogen helium carbon dioxide CO 2  carbon monoxide and syngas and specialty gases Atmospheric gases are produced through various air separation processes of which cryogenic is the most prevalent Process gases are produced by methods other than air separation For example hydrogen carbon monoxide and syngas are produced by steam methane reforming of natural gas and by the gasification of liquid and solid hydrocarbons Hydrogen is produced by purifying byproduct sources obtained from the chemical and petrochemical industries and helium is produced as a byproduct of gases extracted from underground reservoirs primarily natural gas but also CO 2 purified before resale The Industrial Gases business also develops builds and operates equipment for the production or processing of gases such as air separation units and noncryogenic generators 4 Table of Contents Our Industrial Gases business is organized and operated regionally The regional Industrial Gases segments Americas EMEA and Asia supply gases and related equipment in the relevant region to diversified customers in many industries including those in refining chemical gasification metals electronics manufacturing and food and beverage Hydrogen is used by refiners to facilitate the conversion of heavy crude feedstock and lower the sulfur content of gasoline and diesel fuels as well as in the developing mobility markets The chemicals industry uses hydrogen oxygen nitrogen carbon monoxide and syngas as feedstocks in the production of many basic chemicals The energy production industry uses nitrogen injection for enhanced recovery of oil and natural gas and oxygen for gasification Oxygen is used in combustion and industrial heating applications including in the gasification steel certain nonferrous metals glass and cement industries Nitrogen applications are used in food processing for freezing and preserving flavor and nitrogen for inerting is used in various fields including the metals chemical and semiconductor industries Helium is used in laboratories and healthcare for cooling and in other industries for pressurizing purging and lifting Argon is used in the metals and other industries for its unique inerting thermal conductivity and other properties Industrial gases are also used in welding and providing healthcare and are utilized in various manufacturing processes to make them more efficient and to optimize performance Industrial gases are generally produced at or near the point of use given the complexity and inefficiency with storing molecules at low temperatures Helium however is generally sourced globally at long distances from point of sale As a result we maintain an inventory of helium stored in our fleet of ISO containers as well as the US Bureau of Land Management underground storage facility in Amarillo Texas We distribute gases to our sale of gas customers through different supply modes depending on various factors including the customers volume requirements and location Our supply modes are as follows  Liquid Bulk  Product is delivered in bulk in liquid or gaseous form by tanker or tube trailer and stored usually in its liquid state in equipment that we typically design and install at the customers site for vaporizing into a gaseous state as needed Liquid bulk sales are usually governed by three to fiveyear contracts  Packaged Gases  Small quantities of product are delivered in either cylinders or dewars We operate packaged gas businesses in Europe Asia and Latin America In the United States our packaged gas business sells products principally helium only for the electronics and magnetic resonance imaging industries  OnSite Gases  Large quantities of hydrogen nitrogen oxygen carbon monoxide and syngas a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide are provided to customers principally in the energy production and refining chemical gasification and metals industries worldwide that require large volumes of gases and have relatively constant demand Gases are produced at large facilities located adjacent to customers facilities or by pipeline systems from centrally located production facilities and are generally governed by 15 to 20 year contracts We also deliver small quantities of product through small onsite plants cryogenic or noncryogenic generators typically either via a 10 to 15 year sale of gas contract or through the sale of the equipment to the customer Electricity is the largest cost component in the production of atmospheric gases Steam methane reformers utilize natural gas as the primary raw material and gasifiers use liquid and solid hydrocarbons as the principal raw material for the production of hydrogen carbon monoxide and syngas We mitigate electricity natural gas and hydrocarbon price fluctuations contractually through pricing formulas surcharges and cost passthrough and tolling arrangements During fiscal year 2020 no significant difficulties were encountered in obtaining adequate supplies of power and natural gas We obtain helium from a number of sources globally including crude helium for purification from the US Bureau of Land Managements helium reserve The regional Industrial Gases segments also include our share of the results of several joint ventures accounted for by the equity method which are reported in our financial statements as income from equity affiliates The largest of these joint ventures operate in China India Italy Mexico Saudi Arabia South Africa and Thailand 5 Table of Contents Each of the regional Industrial Gases segments competes against three global industrial gas companies Air Liquide SA Messer and Linde plc the successor to Praxair Inc and Linde AG pursuant to a combination that became effective on 31 October 2018 as well as regional competitors Competition in Industrial Gases is based primarily on price reliability of supply and the development of industrial gas applications We derive a competitive advantage in locations where we have pipeline networks which enable us to provide reliable and economic supply of products to our larger customers Overall regional industrial gases sales constituted approximately 94 96 and 94 of consolidated sales in fiscal years 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively Sales of atmospheric gases constituted approximately 47 46 and 46 of consolidated sales in fiscal years 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively while sales of tonnage hydrogen syngas and related products constituted approximately 22 26 and 25 of consolidated sales in fiscal years 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively Industrial Gases Equipment We design and manufacture equipment for air separation hydrocarbon recovery and purification natural gas liquefaction and liquid helium and liquid hydrogen transport and storage The Industrial Gases  Global segment includes activity related to the sale of cryogenic and gas processing equipment for air separation The equipment is sold worldwide to

includes three global equipment businesses our LNG equipment business our Gardner Cryogenics business fabricating helium and hydrogen transport and storage containers and our Rotoflow business which manufactures turboexpanders and other precision rotating equipment Steel aluminum and capital equipment subcomponents compressors etc are the principal raw materials in the manufacturing of equipment Raw materials for individual projects typically are acquired under firm purchase agreements Equipment is produced at our manufacturing sites with certain components being procured from subcontractors and vendors Competition in the equipment business is based primarily on technological performance service technical knowhow price and performance guarantees Sale of equipment constituted approximately 6 4 and 6 of consolidated sales in fiscal years 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively The backlog of equipment orders was approximately 16 billion on 30 September 2020 as compared to a total backlog of approximately 09 billion on 30 September 2019 We estimate that approximately 50 of the total equipment sales backlog as of 30 September 2020 will be recognized as revenue during fiscal year 2021 dependent on execution schedules of the relevant projects International Operations Through our subsidiaries affiliates and joint ventures accounted for using the equity method we conduct business in 53 countries outside the United States Our international businesses are subject to risks customarily encountered in foreign operations including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and controls tariffs trade sanctions and import and export controls and other economic political and regulatory policies of local governments described in Item 1A Risk Factors below We have majority or wholly owned foreign subsidiaries that operate in Canada 18 European countries including the Netherlands Spain and the United Kingdom 11 Asian countries including China South Korea and Taiwan seven Latin American countries including Brazil and Chile six countries in the Middle East including Saudi Arabia and three African countries We also own lessthancontrolling interests in entities operating in Europe Asia Latin America the Middle East and Africa including China Germany India Italy Mexico Oman Saudi Arabia South Africa and Thailand Financial information about our foreign operations and investments is included in Note 8 Summarized Financial Information of Equity Affiliates  Note 22 Income Taxes  and Note 25 Business Segment and Geographic Information  to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 below Information about foreign currency translation is included under Foreign Currency in Note 1 Major Accounting Policies  and information on our exposure to currency fluctuations is included in Note 13 Financial Instruments  to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 below and in Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk included under Item 7A below 6 Table of Contents Technology Development We pursue a marketoriented approach to technology development through research and development engineering and commercial development processes It conducts research and development principally in its laboratories located in the United States Trexlertown Pennsylvania the United Kingdom Basingstoke and Carrington Spain Barcelona China Shanghai and Saudi Arabia Dhahran We also fund and cooperate in research and development programs conducted by a number of major universities and undertake research work funded by others including the United States government Development of technology for use within the Industrial Gases business focuses primarily on new and improved processes and equipment for the production and delivery of industrial gases and new or improved applications for industrial gas products During fiscal year 2020 we owned approximately 850 United States patents approximately 3600 foreign patents and were a licensee under certain patents owned by others While the patents and licenses are considered important we do not consider our business as a whole to be materially dependent upon any particular patent patent license or group of patents or licenses Environmental Regulation We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we have operations Compliance with these laws and regulations results in higher capital expenditures and costs In the normal course of business we are involved in legal proceedings under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act CERCLA the federal Superfund law Resource Conservation and Recovery Act RCRA and similar state and foreign environmental laws relating to the designation of certain sites for investigation or remediation Our accounting policy for environmental expenditures is discussed in Note 1 Major Accounting Policies  and environmental loss contingencies are discussed in Note 17 Commitments and Contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 below Some of our operations are within jurisdictions that have or are developing regulatory regimes governing emissions of greenhouse gases GHG including CO 2  These include existing coverage under the European Union Emission Trading System the California cap and trade scheme Chinas Emission Trading Scheme and its nationwide expansion and South Koreas Emission Trading Scheme In the Netherlands a CO 2 emissions tax will come into force on 1 January 2021 In Canada Albertas Technology Innovation and Emission Reduction TIER System went into effect 1 January 2020 In Ontario Environment  Climate Change Canadas ECCC Output Based Pricing System OBPS is currently in effect however on 20 September 2020 ECCC granted approval of Ontarios GHG Emissions Performance Standards program which will be used in lieu of adherence to the OBPS with the effective date to be determined In addition the US Environmental Protection Agency EPA requires mandatory reporting of GHG emissions and is regulating GHG emissions for new construction and major modifications to existing facilities Some jurisdictions have various mechanisms to target the power sector to achieve emission reductions which often result in higher power costs Increased public concern may result in more international US federal andor regional requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of GHG emissions Although uncertain these developments could increase our costs related to consumption of electric power hydrogen production and application of our gasification technology We believe we will be able to mitigate some of the increased costs through contractual terms but the lack of definitive legislation or regulatory requirements prevents an accurate estimate of the longterm impact these measures will have on our operations Any legislation that limits or taxes GHG emissions could negatively impact our growth increase our operating costs or reduce demand for certain of our products Regulation of GHG may also produce new opportunities for us We continue to develop technologies to help our facilities and our customers lower energy consumption improve efficiency and lower emissions We see significant opportunities for gasification carbon capture technologies and hydrogen for mobility and energy transition We estimate that we spent approximately 4 million 5 million and 3 million in fiscal years 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively on capital projects reflected in continuing operations to control pollution Capital expenditures to control pollution are estimated to be approximately 6 million in both fiscal years 2021 and 2022 For additional information regarding environmental matters refer to Item 7  Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Environmental Matters  and Note 17 Commitments and Contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements 7 Table of Contents Employees We believe our employees are our most valuable asset and are critical to our success as an organization Our goal is to be the safest most diverse and most profitable industrial gas company in the world providing excellent service to our customers Integral to our success is the continued development of our 4S culture Safety Speed Simplicity and SelfConfidence and creating a work environment where all employees feel that they belong and matter Our talent related initiatives including employee recruitment and development diversity and inclusion and compensation and benefit programs are focused on building and retaining the worldclass and talented staff that is needed to meet our goals On 30 September 2020 we had approximately 19275 employees of whom approximately 19000 were fulltime and of whom approximately 14150 were located outside the United States We have collective bargaining agreements with unions at certain locations that expire on various dates over the next four years We consider relations with our employees to be good We value the contributions of our employees particularly in the face of the challenges posed by the COVID19 pandemic Many of our employees are on the front line during the pandemic keeping our plants running and delivering to our customers the products they need When possible employees have been working from home to help maintain their health and safety as well as business continuity We have not laid off any of our employees or reduced their salaries due to COVID19 In October 2020 we announced goals to further increase the percentage of women and US minorities in professional and managerial roles By 2025 we aim to achieve at least 28 percent female representation in the professional and managerial population globally and at least 20 percent minority representation in that same population in the United States These measures are increases from 25 and 17 percent representation 2020 baseline respectively We established these new targets following analysis of our global employee representation metrics and future talent needs as well as assessing industry benchmarks and peer companies Seasonality Our businesses are not subject to seasonal fluctuations to any material extent Inventories We maintain limited inventory where required to facilitate the supply of products to customers on a reasonable delivery schedule Inventory consists primarily of crude helium industrial gas and specialty gas inventories supplied to customers through liquid bulk and packaged gases supply modes Customers We do not have a homogeneous customer base or end market and no single customer accounts for more than 10 of our consolidated revenues We do have concentrations of customers in specific industries primarily refining chemicals and electronics Within each of these industries we have several largevolume customers with longterm contracts A negative trend affecting one of these industries or the loss of one of these major customers although not material to our consolidated revenue could have an adverse impact on our financial results Governmental Contracts Our business is not subject to a government entitys renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts that would be material to our business as a whole Available Information All periodic and current reports registration

Linde Group including as Managing Director of Linde Engineering from 20082014 Item 1A Risk Factors Our operations are affected by various risks many of which are beyond our control In evaluating investment in the Company and the forwardlooking information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10K or presented elsewhere by management from time to time you should carefully consider the risk factors discussed below Any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forwardlooking statements are made and could adversely affect the value of an investment in our securities In addition to the following risks there may be additional risks and uncertainties that adversely affect our business performance or financial condition in the future that are not presently known are not currently believed to be significant or are not identified below because they are common to all businesses Risks Related to Economic Conditions The COVID19 global pandemic may materially and adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations The COVID19 global pandemic and efforts to reduce its spread have led to a significant decline of economic activity and significant disruption and volatility in global markets These factors have led to reduced demand for industrial gas products particularly in our merchant business We expect demand to continue to be impacted as well as the timing of certain planned maintenance activities In addition COVID19 may result in reduced sales in our other businesses lower returns for certain of our projects and the potential delay or cancellation of certain projects in our pipeline In addition we are monitoring the health of our employees and many of our employees including those based at our headquarters are working remotely in accordance with health safety guidance and applicable governmental orders Action by health or other governmental authorities requiring the closure of our facilities or recommending other physical distancing measures could negatively impact our business and those of our service providers and customers Although we have business continuity and other safeguards in place we cannot be certain that they will be fully effective for extended periods of time As the pandemic and responses to it continue to evolve we may experience further adverse impacts on our operations and our ability to access capital on favorable terms or at all may be impaired In addition we may face unpredictable increases in demand for certain of our products when restrictions on business and travel end If demand for our products exceeds our capacity it could adversely affect our financial results and customer relationships Although the duration and ultimate impact of these factors is unknown at this time the decline in economic conditions due to COVID19 or another diseasecausing similar impacts may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and such impact may be material Further to the extent COVID19 adversely affects our business financial condition and results of operations and global economic conditions more generally it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described herein 9 Table of Contents Changes in global and regional economic conditions the markets we serve or the financial markets may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows Unfavorable conditions in the global economy or regional economies the markets we serve or financial markets may decrease the demand for our goods and services and adversely impact our revenues operating results and cash flows Demand for our products and services depends in part on the general economic conditions affecting the countries and markets in which we do business Weak economic conditions in certain geographies and changing supply and demand balances in the markets we serve have negatively impacted demand for our products and services in the past including most recently due to COVID19 and may do so in the future Reduced demand for our products and services would have a negative impact on our revenues and earnings In addition reduced demand could depress sales reduce our margins constrain our operating flexibility or reduce efficient utilization of our manufacturing capacity or result in charges which are unusual or nonrecurring Excess capacity in our manufacturing facilities or those of our competitors could decrease our ability to maintain pricing and generate profits In addition our operating results in one or more segments may be affected by uncertain or deteriorating economic conditions for particular customer markets within a segment A decline in the industries served by our customers or adverse events or circumstances affecting individual customers can reduce demand for our products and services and impair the ability of such customers to satisfy their obligations to us resulting in uncollected receivables unanticipated contract terminations project delays or the inability to recover plant investments any of which may negatively impact our financial results Weak overall demand or specific customer conditions may also cause customer shutdowns or defaults or other inabilities to operate facilities profitably and may force sale or abandonment of facilities and equipment or prevent projects from coming onstream when expected These or other events associated with weak economic conditions or specific market product or customer events may require us to record an impairment on tangible assets such as facilities and equipment or intangible assets such as intellectual property or goodwill which would have a negative impact on our financial results Our extensive international operations can be adversely impacted by operational economic political security legal and currency translation risks that could decrease profitability In fiscal year 2020 over 60 of our sales were derived from customers outside the United States and many of our operations suppliers and employees are located outside the United States Our operations in foreign jurisdictions may be subject to risks including exchange control regulations import and trade restrictions trade policy and other potentially detrimental domestic and foreign governmental practices or policies affecting US companies doing business abroad Changing economic and political conditions within foreign jurisdictions strained relations between countries or the imposition of tariffs or international sanctions can cause fluctuations in demand price volatility supply disruptions or loss of property The occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operation and cash flows Our growth strategies depend in part on our ability to further penetrate markets outside the United States particularly in markets such as China India Indonesia and the Middle East and involve significantly larger and more complex projects including gasification projects some in regions where there is the potential for significant economic and political disruptions We are actively investing large amounts of capital and other resources in some cases through joint ventures in developing markets which we believe to have high growth potential Our operations in these markets may be subject to greater risks than those faced by our operations in mature economies including political and economic instability project delay or abandonment due to unanticipated government actions inadequate investment in infrastructure undeveloped property rights and legal systems unfamiliar regulatory environments relationships with local partners language and cultural differences and increased difficulty recruiting training and retaining qualified employees In addition our properties and contracts in these locations may be subject to seizure and cancellation respectively without full compensation for loss Successful operation of particular facilities or execution of projects may be disrupted by civil unrest acts of war sabotage or terrorism and other local security concerns Such concerns may require us to incur greater costs for security or require us to shut down operations for a period of time 10 Table of Contents Furthermore because the majority of our revenue is generated from sales outside the United States we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates Our business is primarily exposed to translational currency risk as the results of our foreign operations are translated into US dollars at current exchange rates throughout the fiscal period Our policy is to minimize cash flow volatility from changes in currency exchange rates We choose not to hedge the translation of our foreign subsidiaries earnings into dollars Accordingly reported sales net earnings cash flows and fair values have been and in the future will be affected by changes in foreign exchange rates For a more detailed discussion of currency exposure see Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  below Risks Related to Our Business Operational and project execution risks particularly with respect to our largest projects may adversely affect our operations or financial results A significant and growing portion of our business involves gasification and other largescale projects that involve challenging engineering procurement and construction phases that may last up to several years These projects are technically complex often reliant on significant interaction with government authorities and face significant financing development operational and reputational risks We may encounter difficulties in engineering delays in designs or materials provided by the customer or a third party equipment and materials delivery delays schedule changes customer scope changes delays related to obtaining regulatory permits and rightsofway inability to find adequate sources of labor in the locations where we are building new plants weatherrelated delays delays by customers contractors in completing their portion of a project technical or transportation difficulties cost overruns supply difficulties geopolitical risks and other factors many of which are beyond our control that may impact our ability to complete a project within the original delivery schedule In some cases delays and additional costs may be substantial and we may be required to cancel a project andor compensate the customer for the delay We may not be able to recover any of these costs In addition in some cases we seek financing for large projects and face market risk associated with the availability and terms of such financing These financing arrangements may require that we comply with certain performance requirements which if not met could result in default and restructuring costs or other losses All of these factors could also negatively impact our reputation or relationships with our customers suppliers and other third parties any of which could adversely affect our ability to secure new projects in the future The operation of our facilities pipelines and delivery systems inherently entails hazards that require continuous oversight and control such as pipeline leaks and ruptures fire explosions toxic releases mechanical failures or vehicle accidents If operational risks materialize they could result in loss of life damage to the environment or loss of production all of which could negatively impact our ongoing operations reputation financial results and cash flows In addition our operating results are dependent on the continued operation of our production facilities and our ability to meet customer requirements which depend in part on our ability to properly maintain and replace aging assets We are subject to extensive government regulation in the jurisdictions in which we do business Regulations addressing among other things importexport restrictions antibribery and corruption and taxes can negatively impact our financial condition results of operation and cash flows We are subject to government regulation in the United States and in the foreign jurisdictions where we conduct business The application of laws and regulations to our business is sometimes unclear Compliance with laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in business practices that could result in reduced profitability If there is a determination that we have failed to comply with applicable laws or regulations we may be subject to penalties or sanctions that could adversely impact our reputation and financial results Compliance with changes in laws or regulations can result in increased operating costs and require additional unplanned capital expenditures Export controls or other regulatory restrictions could prevent us from shipping our products to and from some markets or increase the cost of doing so Changes in tax laws and regulations and international tax treaties could affect the financial results of our businesses Increasingly aggressive enforcement of antibribery and anticorruption requirements including the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act the United Kingdom Bribery Act and the China AntiUnfair Competition Law could subject us to criminal or civil sanctions if a violation is deemed to have occurred In addition we are subject to laws and sanctions imposed by the US and other jurisdictions where we do business that may prohibit us or certain of our affiliates from doing business in certain countries or restricting the kind of business that we may conduct Such restrictions may provide a competitive advantage to competitors who are not subject to comparable restrictions or prevent us from taking advantage of growth opportunities 11 Table of Contents Further we cannot guarantee that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by employees agents business partners or that businesses that we acquire would not violate US andor nonUS laws including the laws governing payments to government officials bribery fraud kickbacks and false claims pricing sales and marketing practices conflicts of interest competition export and import compliance money laundering and data privacy Any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the US and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits could lead to substantial civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees In addition the government may seek to hold us liable as a successor for violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire We may be unable to successfully identify execute or effectively integrate acquisitions or effectively disentangle divested businesses  Our ability to grow revenue earnings and cash flow at anticipated rates depends in part on our ability to identify successfully acquire and integrate businesses and assets at appropriate prices and realize expected growth synergies and operating efficiencies We may not be able to complete transactions on favorable terms on a timely basis or at all In addition our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by the failure of acquired businesses or assets to meet expected returns the failure to integrate acquired businesses the inability to dispose of noncore assets and businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions and the discovery of unanticipated liabilities or other problems in acquired businesses or assets for which we lack adequate contractual protections or insurance In addition we may incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions that do not meet expectations We continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment These transactions pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business and financial statements For example when we decide to sell or otherwise dispose of a business or assets we may be unable to do so on satisfactory terms within our anticipated time frame or at all In addition divestitures or other dispositions may dilute our earnings per share have other adverse financial and accounting impacts distract management and give rise to disputes with buyers In addition we have agreed and may in the future agree to indemnify buyers against known and unknown contingent liabilities Our financial results could be impacted adversely by claims under these indemnification provisions The security of our information technology systems could be compromised which could adversely affect our ability to operate We depend on information technology to enable us to operate efficiently and interface with customers as well as to maintain our internal controls environment and financial reporting accuracy and efficiency Our information technology capabilities are delivered through a combination of internal and external services and service providers If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure we could be subject to transaction errors processing inefficiencies the loss of customers business disruptions or the loss of or damage to our confidential business information due to a security breach In addition our information technology systems may be damaged disrupted or shut down due to attacks by computer hackers computer viruses employee error or malfeasance power outages hardware failures telecommunication or utility failures catastrophes or other unforeseen events and in any such circumstances our system redundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate Security breaches of our systems or the systems of our customers suppliers or other business partners could result in the misappropriation destruction or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to us or to our employees partners customers or suppliers and may subject us to legal liability As with most large systems our information technology systems have in the past been and in the future likely will be subject to computer viruses malicious codes unauthorized access and other cyberattacks and we expect the sophistication and frequency of such attacks to continue to increase To date we are not aware of any significant impact on our operations or financial results from such attempts however unauthorized access could disrupt our business operations result in the loss of assets and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations Any of the attacks breaches or other disruptions or damage described above could interrupt our operations at one or more sites delay production and shipments result in the theft of our and our customers intellectual property and trade secrets damage customer and business partner relationships and our reputation result in defective products or services legal claims and proceedings liability and penalties under privacy laws or increased costs for security and remediation or raise concerns regarding our internal controls environment and internal controls over financial reporting Each of these consequences could adversely affect our business reputation and our financial statements 12 Table of Contents Our business involves the use storage and transmission of information about our employees vendors and customers The protection of such information as well as our proprietary information is critical to us The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding with the frequent imposition of new and constantly changing requirements We have established policies and procedures to help protect the security and privacy of this information We also from time to time export sensitive customer data and technical information to recipients outside the United States Breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or our customers including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud trickery or other forms of deception could expose us our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information which could ultimately result in litigation and potential legal and financial liability These events could also damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business Interruption in ordinary sources of raw material or energy supply or an inability to recover increases in energy and raw material costs from customers could result in lost sales or reduced profitability Hydrocarbons including natural gas are the primary feedstock for the production of hydrogen carbon monoxide and syngas Energy including electricity natural gas and diesel fuel for delivery trucks is the largest cost component of our business Because our industrial gas facilities use substantial amounts of electricity energy price fluctuations could materially impact our revenues and earnings A disruption in the supply of energy components or raw materials whether due to market conditions legislative or regulatory actions natural events or other disruption could prevent us from meeting our contractual commitments and harm our business and financial results Our supply of crude helium for purification and resale is largely dependent upon natural gas production by crude helium suppliers Lower natural gas production resulting from natural gas pricing dynamics supplier operating or transportation issues or other interruptions in sales from crude helium suppliers can reduce our supplies of crude helium available for processing and resale to customers We typically contract to passthrough cost increases in energy and raw materials to customers but cost variability can still have a negative impact on our results We may be unable to raise prices as quickly as costs rise or competitive pressures may prevent full recovery of such costs Increases in energy or raw material costs that cannot be passed on to customers for competitive or other reasons may negatively impact our revenues and earnings Even where costs are passed through price increases can cause lower sales volume New technologies create performance risks that could impact our financial results or reputation We are continually developing and implementing new technologies and product offerings Existing technologies are being implemented in products and designs or at scales beyond our experience base These technological expansions can create nontraditional performance risks to our operations Failure of the technologies to work as predicted or unintended consequences of new designs or uses could lead to cost overruns project delays financial penalties or damage to our reputation In addition large scale gasification projects may contain processes or technologies that we have not operated at the same scale or in the same combination and although such projects generally include technologies and processes that have been demonstrated previously by others such technologies or processes may be new to us and may introduce new risks to our operations Additionally there is also a risk that our new technologies may become obsolete and replaced by other market alternatives Performance difficulties on these larger projects may have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results In addition performance challenges may adversely affect our reputation and our ability to obtain future contracts for gasification projects Protecting our intellectual property is critical to our technological development and we may suffer competitive harm from infringement on such rights As we develop new technologies it is critical that we protect our intellectual property assets against thirdparty infringement We own a number of patents and other forms of intellectual property related to our products and services As we develop new technologies there is a risk that our patent applications may not be granted or we may not receive sufficient protection of our proprietary interests We may also expend considerable resources in defending our patents against thirdparty infringement It is critical that we protect our proprietary interests to prevent competitive harm 13 Table of Contents Legal and Regulatory Risks Legislative regulatory and societal responses to global climate change create financial risk We are the worlds leading supplier of hydrogen the primary use of which is the production of ultralow sulfur transportation fuels that have significantly reduced transportation emissions and helped improve human health To make the high volumes of hydrogen needed by our customers we use steam methane reforming which releases carbon dioxide In addition although gasification enables the conversion of lower value feedstocks into cleaner energy and valueadded products our gasification projects will increase our carbon footprint because the gasification process produces carbon dioxide Some of our operations are within jurisdictions that have or are developing regulatory regimes governing GHG emissions including CO 2  which may lead to direct and indirect costs on our operations Furthermore some jurisdictions have various mechanisms to target the power sector to achieve emission reductions which often result in higher power costs Increased public concern and governmental action may result in more international US federal andor regional requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of GHG emissions Although uncertain these developments could increase our costs related to consumption of electric power hydrogen production and application of our gasification technology We believe we will be able to mitigate some of the increased costs through contractual terms but the lack of definitive legislation or regulatory requirements prevents an accurate estimate of the longterm impact these measures will have on our operations Any legislation or governmental action that limits or taxes GHG emissions could negatively impact our growth increase our operating costs or reduce demand for certain of our products Our financial results may be affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings including antitrust tax environmental or other matters We are subject to litigation and regulatory investigations and proceedings in the normal course of business and could become subject to additional claims in the future some of which could be material While we seek to limit our liability in our commercial contractual arrangements there are no guarantees that each contract will contain suitable limitations of liability or that limitations of liability will be enforceable Also the outcome of existing legal proceedings may differ from our expectations because the outcomes of litigation including regulatory matters are often difficult to predict reliably Various factors or developments can lead us to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible to reasonable estimates such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment a significant settlement significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law A future adverse ruling settlement or unfavorable development could result in charges that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows in any particular period Costs and expenses resulting from compliance with environmental regulations may negatively impact our operations and financial results We are subject to extensive federal state local and foreign environmental and safety laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions in the air discharges to land and water and the generation handling treatment and disposal of hazardous waste and other materials We take our environmental responsibilities very seriously but there is a risk of adverse environmental impact inherent in our manufacturing operations and in the transportation of our products Future developments and more stringent environmental regulations may require us to make additional unforeseen environmental expenditures In addition laws and regulations may require significant expenditures for environmental protection equipment compliance and remediation These additional costs may adversely affect our financial results For a more detailed description of these matters see Item 1 BusinessEnvironmental Regulation  above 14 Table of Contents A change of tax law in key jurisdictions could result in a material increase in our tax expense The multinational nature of our business subjects us to taxation in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions Due to economic and political conditions tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change Our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation Changes to income tax laws and regulations in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate or in the interpretation of such laws could significantly increase our effective tax rate and adversely impact our financial condition results of operations or cash flows In December 2017 the US enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act the Tax Act which significantly revised the US federal corporate income tax law by among other things lowering the corporate income tax rate implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a onetime tax on accumulated unremitted nonUS earnings of foreign subsidiaries Various levels of government are increasingly focused on tax reform and other legislative action to increase tax revenue Further changes in tax laws in the US or foreign jurisdictions where we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition We could incur significant liability if the distribution of Versum common stock to our stockholders is determined to be a taxable transaction We have received an opinion from outside tax counsel to the effect that the spinoff of Versum qualifies as a transaction that is described in Sections 355a and 368a1D of the Internal Revenue Code The opinion relies on certain facts assumptions representations and undertakings from Versum and us regarding the past and future conduct of the companies respective businesses and other matters If any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied our shareholders and we may not be able to rely on the opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities Notwithstanding the opinion of tax counsel we have received the IRS could determine on audit that the spinoff is taxable if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion If the spinoff is determined to be taxable for US federal income tax purposes our shareholders that are subject to US federal income tax and we could incur significant US federal income tax liabilities General Risk Factors Catastrophic events could disrupt our operations or the operations of our suppliers or customers having a negative impact on our business financial results and cash flows Our operations could be impacted by catastrophic events outside our control including severe weather conditions such as hurricanes floods earthquakes storms epidemics pandemics acts of war and terrorism Any such event could cause a serious business disruption that could affect our ability to produce and distribute products and possibly expose us to thirdparty liability claims Additionally such events could impact our suppliers customers and partners which could cause energy and raw materials to be unavailable to us or our customers to be unable to purchase or accept our products and services Any such occurrence could have a negative impact on our operations and financial results The United Kingdoms UK exit from European Union EU membership could adversely affect our European Operations The UKs exit from EU membership may adversely affect customer demand our relationships with customers and suppliers and our European business Although it is unknown what the terms of the United Kingdoms future relationship with the EU will be it is possible that there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the United Kingdom and EU members and increased regulatory complexities Any of these factors could adversely affect customer demand our relationships with customers and suppliers and our European business overall Inability to compete effectively in a segment could adversely impact sales and financial performance We face strong competition from large global competitors and many smaller regional competitors in many of our business segments Introduction by competitors of new technologies competing products or additional capacity could weaken demand for or impact pricing of our products negatively impacting financial results In addition competitors pricing policies could affect our profitability or market share 15 Table of Contents Item 1B Unresolved Staff Comments We have not received any written comments from the Commission staff that remain

proceedings including commercial competition environmental intellectual property regulatory product liability and insurance matters Although litigation with respect to these matters is routine and incidental to the conduct of our business such litigation could result in large monetary awards especially if compensatory andor punitive damages are awarded However we believe that litigation currently pending to which we are a party will be resolved without any material adverse effect on our financial position earnings or cash flows From time to time we are also involved in proceedings investigations and audits involving governmental authorities in connection with environmental health safety competition and tax matters We are a party to proceedings under CERCLA RCRA and similar state and foreign environmental laws relating to the designation of certain sites for investigation or remediation Presently there are 31 sites on which a final settlement has not been reached where we along with others have been designated a potentially responsible party by the Environmental Protection Agency or is otherwise engaged in investigation or remediation including cleanup activity at certain of its current and former manufacturing sites We do not expect that any sums we may have to pay in connection with these environmental matters would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position Additional information on our environmental exposure is included under Item 1 BusinessEnvironmental Regulation and Note 17 Commitments and Contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements In September 2010 the Brazilian Administrative Council for Economic Defense CADE issued a decision against our Brazilian subsidiary Air Products Brasil Ltda and several other Brazilian industrial gas companies for alleged anticompetitive activities CADE imposed a civil fine of R1792 million approximately 32 million at 30 September 2020 on Air Products Brasil Ltda This fine was based on a recommendation by a unit of the Brazilian Ministry of Justice whose investigation began in 2003 alleging violation of competition laws with respect to the sale of industrial and medical gases The fines are based on a percentage of our total revenue in Brazil in 2003 We have denied the allegations made by the authorities and filed an appeal in October 2010 to the Brazilian courts On 6 May 2014 our appeal was granted and the fine against Air Products Brasil Ltda was dismissed CADE has appealed that ruling and the matter remains pending We with advice of our outside legal counsel have assessed the status of this matter and have concluded that although an adverse final judgment after exhausting all appeals is possible such a judgment is not probable As a result no provision has been made in the consolidated financial statements Other than the CADE matter discussed above we do not currently believe there are any legal proceedings individually or in the aggregate that are reasonably possible to have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows However a future charge for regulatory fines or damage awards could have a significant impact on our net income in the period in which it is recorded Additional information on our legal proceedings can be found in Note 17 Commitments and Contingencies  to the consolidated
