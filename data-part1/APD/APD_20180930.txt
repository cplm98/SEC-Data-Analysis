include atmospheric gases process and specialty gases equipment and services The Company is the worlds largest supplier of hydrogen and has built leading positions in growth markets such as helium and natural gas liquefaction As used in this report unless the context indicates otherwise the terms we our us the Company or registrant include controlled subsidiaries affiliates and predecessors of Air Products and its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates During its fiscal year ended 30 September 2018 fiscal year 2018  the Company reported its continuing operations in five reporting segments under which it managed its operations assessed performance and reported earnings Industrial Gases  Americas Industrial Gases  EMEA Europe Middle East and Africa Industrial Gases  Asia Industrial Gases  Global and Corporate and other Except as otherwise noted the description of the Companys business below reflects the Companys continuing operations Refer to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 25  Business Segment and Geographic Information  and Note 3  Discontinued Operations  to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on our reportable business segments and our discontinued operations Industrial Gases Business The Companys Industrial Gases business produces atmospheric gases oxygen nitrogen argon and rare gases process gases hydrogen helium carbon dioxide carbon monoxide syngas and specialty gases and equipment for the production or processing of gases such as air separation units and noncryogenic generators Atmospheric gases are produced through various air separation processes of which cryogenic is the most prevalent Process gases are produced by methods other than air separation For example hydrogen carbon monoxide and syngas are produced by steam methane reforming of natural gas and by the gasification of liquid and solid hydrocarbons Hydrogen is also produced by purifying byproduct sources obtained from the chemical and petrochemical industries and helium is produced as a byproduct of gases extracted from underground reservoirs primarily natural gas but also carbon dioxide purified before resale The Companys Industrial Gases business is organized and operated regionally The regional Industrial Gases segments Americas EMEA and Asia supply gases and related equipment in the relevant region to diversified customers in many industries including those in refining chemical gasification metals electronics manufacturing and food and beverage Hydrogen is used by refiners to facilitate the conversion of heavy crude feedstock and lower the sulfur content of gasoline and diesel fuels The chemicals industry uses hydrogen oxygen nitrogen carbon monoxide and syngas as feedstocks in the production of many basic chemicals The energy production industry uses nitrogen injection for enhanced recovery of oil and natural gas and oxygen for gasification Oxygen is used in combustion and industrial heating applications including in the gasification steel certain nonferrous metals glass and cement industries Nitrogen applications are used in food processing for freezing and preserving flavor and nitrogen for inerting is used in various fields including the metals chemical and semiconductor industries Helium is used in laboratories and healthcare for cooling and in other industries for pressurizing purging and lifting Argon is used in the metals and other industries for its unique inerting thermal conductivity and other properties Industrial gases are also used in welding and providing healthcare and are utilized in various manufacturing processes to make them more efficient and to optimize performance 4 Table of Contents We distribute gases to our customers through a variety of supply modes Liquid Bulk Product is delivered in bulk in liquid or gaseous form by tanker or tube trailer and stored usually in its liquid state in equipment designed and installed typically by the Company at the customers site for vaporizing into a gaseous state as needed Liquid bulk sales are usually governed by three to fiveyear contracts Packaged Gases Small quantities of product are delivered in either cylinders or dewars The Company operates packaged gas businesses in Europe Asia and Latin America In the United States the Companys packaged gas business sells products principally helium only for the electronics and magnetic resonance imaging industries OnSite Gases Large quantities of hydrogen nitrogen oxygen carbon monoxide and syngas a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide are provided to customers principally the energy production and refining chemical gasification and metals industries worldwide that require large volumes of gases and have relatively constant demand Gases are produced at large facilities located adjacent to customers facilities or by pipeline systems from centrally located production facilities and are generally governed by 15 to 20 year contracts The Company also delivers small quantities of product through small onsite plants cryogenic or noncryogenic generators typically either via a 10 to 15 year sale of gas contract or through the sale of the equipment to the customer Electricity is the largest cost component in the production of atmospheric gases Steam methane reformers utilize natural gas as the primary raw material and gasifiers use liquid and solid hydrocarbons as the principal raw material for the production of hydrogen carbon monoxide and syngas We mitigate electricity natural gas and hydrocarbon price fluctuations contractually through pricing formulas surcharges and cost passthrough and tolling arrangements During fiscal year 2018  no significant difficulties were encountered in obtaining adequate supplies of power and natural gas The Company obtains helium from a number of sources globally including crude helium for purification from the US Bureau of Land Managements helium reserve The regional Industrial Gases segments also include our share of the results of several joint ventures accounted for by the equity method The largest of these joint ventures operate in Mexico

affected by various risks many of which are beyond our control In evaluating investment in the Company and the forwardlooking information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10K or presented elsewhere by management from time to time you should consider the following risk factors Any of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forwardlooking statements are made and could adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock as well While we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business there may be additional risks and uncertainties that adversely affect our business performance or financial condition in the future that are not presently known are not currently believed to be significant or are not identified below because they are common to all businesses Changes in global and regional economic conditions the markets we serve or the financial markets may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows Unfavorable conditions in the global economy or regional economies the markets we serve or financial markets may decrease the demand for our goods and services and adversely impact our revenues operating results and cash flows Demand for our products and services depends in part on the general economic conditions affecting the countries and markets in which we do business Weak economic conditions in certain geographies and changing supply and demand balances in the markets we serve have negatively impacted demand for our products and services in the past and may do so in the future Reduced demand for our products and services would have a negative impact on our revenues and earnings In addition reduced demand could depress sales reduce our margins constrain our operating flexibility or reduce efficient utilization of our manufacturing capacity or result in charges which are unusual or nonrecurring Excess capacity in our manufacturing facilities or those of our competitors could decrease our ability to maintain pricing and generate profits Our operating results in one or more segments may also be affected by uncertain or deteriorating economic conditions for particular customer markets within a segment A decline in the industries served by our customers or adverse events or circumstances affecting individual customers can impair the ability of such customers to satisfy their obligations to the Company resulting in uncollected receivables unanticipated contract terminations project delays or inability to recover plant investments any of which may negatively impact our financial results 8 Table of Contents Weak overall demand or specific customer conditions may also cause customer shutdowns or default or other inabilities to operate facilities profitably and may force sale or abandonment of facilities and equipment or prevent projects from coming onstream These or other events associated with weak economic conditions or specific end market product or customer events may require us to record an impairment on tangible assets such as facilities and equipment or intangible assets such as intellectual property or goodwill which would have a negative impact on our financial results Our extensive international operations can be adversely impacted by operational economic political security legal and currency translation risks that could decrease profitability In fiscal year 2018 over 60 of our sales were derived from customers outside the United States and many of our operations suppliers and employees are located outside the United States Our operations in foreign jurisdictions may be subject to risks including exchange control regulations import and trade restrictions trade policy and other potentially detrimental domestic and foreign governmental practices or policies affecting US companies doing business abroad Changing economic and political conditions within foreign jurisdictions strained relations between countries or the imposition of tariffs or international sanctions can cause fluctuations in demand price volatility supply disruptions or loss of property The occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operation and cash flows Our growth strategies depend in part on our ability to further penetrate markets outside the United States particularly in highergrowth markets and involve larger and more complex projects including worldscale gasification projects in regions where there is the potential for significant economic and political disruptions including Russia the Middle East and China We are actively investing significant capital and other resources in some cases through joint ventures in developing or high growth markets which present special risks Our operations in these markets may be subject to greater risks than those faced by our operations in mature economies including political and economic instability project delay or abandonment due to unanticipated government actions inadequate investment in infrastructure undeveloped property rights and legal systems unfamiliar regulatory environments relationships with local partners language and cultural differences and talent risks Our contracts in these locations may be subject to cancellation without full compensation for loss Successful operation of particular facilities or execution of projects may be disrupted by civil unrest acts of sabotage or terrorism and other local security concerns Such concerns may require us to incur greater costs for security or require us to shut down operations for a period of time Because the majority of our revenue is generated from sales outside the United States we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates Our business is primarily exposed to translational currency risk as the results of our foreign operations are translated into US dollars at current exchange rates throughout the fiscal period Our policy is to minimize cash flow volatility from changes in currency exchange rates We choose not to hedge the translation of our foreign subsidiaries earnings into dollars Accordingly reported sales net earnings cash flows and fair values have been and in the future will be affected by changes in foreign exchange rates For a more detailed discussion of currency exposure see Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk below Operational and project execution risks may adversely affect our operations or financial results Some of our projects including some of our largest growth projects involve challenging engineering procurement and construction phases that may occur in more risky locations and over extended time periods sometimes up to several years We may encounter difficulties in engineering delays in designs or materials provided by the customer or a third party equipment and materials delivery delays schedule changes customer scope changes delays related to obtaining regulatory permits and rightsofway inability to find adequate sources of labor in the locations where we are building new plants weatherrelated delays delays by customers contractors in completing their portion of a project technical or transportation difficulties and other factors some of which are beyond our control but which may impact our ability to complete a project within the original delivery schedule In some cases delays and additional costs may be substantial and we may be required to cancel a project andor compensate the customer for the delay We may not be able to recover any of these costs These factors could also negatively impact our reputation or relationships with our customers which could adversely affect our ability to secure new contracts in the future and these risks are more significant as we take on larger and more complex projects including gasification projects as part of our growth strategy 9 Table of Contents The operation of our facilities pipelines and delivery systems inherently entails hazards that require continuous oversight and control such as pipeline leaks and ruptures fire explosions toxic releases mechanical failures or vehicle accidents If operational risks materialize they could result in loss of life damage to the environment or loss of production all of which could negatively impact our ongoing operations reputation financial results and cash flows In addition our operating results are dependent on the continued operation of our production facilities and our ability to meet customer requirements which depend in part on our ability to properly maintain and replace aging assets We are subject to extensive government regulation in the jurisdictions in which we do business Regulations addressing among other things environmental compliance importexport restrictions antibribery and corruption and taxes can negatively impact our financial condition results of operation and cash flows We are subject to government regulation in the United States and in the foreign jurisdictions where we conduct business The application of laws and regulations to our business is sometimes unclear Compliance with laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in business practices that could result in reduced profitability If there is a determination that we have failed to comply with applicable laws or regulations we may be subject to penalties or sanctions that could adversely impact our reputation and financial results Compliance with changes in laws or regulations can result in increased operating costs and require additional capital expenditures Export controls or other regulatory restrictions could prevent us from shipping our products to and from some markets or increase the cost of doing so Changes in tax laws and regulations and international tax treaties could affect the financial results of our businesses Increasingly aggressive enforcement of antibribery and anticorruption requirements including the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act the United Kingdom Bribery Act and the China AntiUnfair Competition Law could subject us to criminal or civil sanctions if a violation is deemed to have occurred In addition we are subject to laws and sanctions imposed by the US and other jurisdictions where we do business that may prohibit us or certain of our affiliates from doing business in certain countries or restricting the kind of business that we may conduct Such restrictions may provide a competitive advantage to competitors who are not subject to comparable restrictions or prevent us from taking advantage of growth opportunities Further we cannot guarantee that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by employees agents business partners or businesses that we acquire that would violate US andor nonUS laws including the laws governing payments to government officials bribery fraud kickbacks and false claims pricing sales and marketing practices conflicts of interest competition export and import compliance money laundering and data privacy Any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the United States and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits could lead to substantial civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees In addition the government may seek to hold us liable as a successor for violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire We may be unable to successfully identify execute or effectively integrate acquisitions or effectively disentangle divested businesses Our ability to grow revenue earnings and cash flow at anticipated rates depends in part on our ability to identify successfully acquire and integrate businesses and assets at appropriate prices and realize expected growth synergies and operating efficiencies We may not be able to complete transactions on favorable terms on a timely basis or at all In addition our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by the failure of acquired businesses or assets to meet expected returns the failure to integrate acquired businesses the inability to dispose of noncore assets and businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions and the discovery of unanticipated liabilities or other problems in acquired businesses or assets for which we lack adequate contractual protections or insurance In addition we may incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions that do not meet expectations We continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment These transactions pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business and financial statements For example when we decide to sell or otherwise dispose of a business or assets we may be unable to do so on satisfactory terms within our anticipated time frame or at all In addition divestitures or other dispositions may dilute our earnings per share have other adverse financial and accounting impacts distract management and give rise to disputes with buyers In addition we have agreed and may in the future agree to indemnify buyers against known and unknown contingent liabilities Our financial results could be impacted adversely by claims under these indemnities 10 Table of Contents The security of our information technology systems could be compromised which could adversely affect our ability to operate We depend on information technology to enable us to operate efficiently and interface with customers as well as to maintain financial accuracy and efficiency Our information technology capabilities are delivered through a combination of internal and external services and service providers If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure we could be subject to transaction errors processing inefficiencies the loss of customers business disruptions or the loss of or damage to our confidential business information due to a security breach In addition our information technology systems may be damaged disrupted or shut down due to attacks by computer hackers computer viruses employee error or malfeasance power outages hardware failures telecommunication or utility failures catastrophes or other unforeseen events and in any such circumstances our system redundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate Security breaches of our systems or the systems of our customers suppliers or other business partners could result in the misappropriation destruction or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to us or to our employees partners customers or suppliers and may subject us to legal liability As with most large systems our information technology systems have in the past been and in the future likely will be subject to computer viruses malicious codes unauthorized access and other cyberattacks and we expect the sophistication and frequency of such attacks to continue to increase To date we are not aware of any significant impact on our operations or financial results from such attempts however unauthorized access could disrupt our business operations result in the loss of assets and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations Any of the attacks breaches or other disruptions or damage described above could interrupt our operations at one or more sites delay production and shipments result in the theft of our and our customers intellectual property and trade secrets damage customer and business partner relationships and our reputation result in defective products or services legal claims and proceedings liability and penalties under privacy laws or increased costs for security and remediation or raise concerns regarding our accounting for transactions Each of these consequences could adversely affect our business reputation and our financial statements Our business involves the use storage and transmission of information about our employees vendors and customers The protection of such information as well as our proprietary information is critical to us The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding with the frequent imposition of new and constantly changing requirements We have established policies and procedures to help protect the security and privacy of this information We also from time to time export sensitive customer data and technical information to recipients outside the United States Breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or our customers including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud trickery or other forms of deception could expose us our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information which could ultimately result in litigation and potential legal and financial liability These events could also damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business Interruption in ordinary sources of raw material or energy supply or an inability to recover increases in energy and raw material costs from customers could result in lost sales or reduced profitability Hydrocarbons including natural gas are the primary feedstock for the production of hydrogen carbon monoxide and syngas Energy including electricity natural gas and diesel fuel for delivery trucks is the largest cost component of our business Because our industrial gas facilities use substantial amounts of electricity energy price fluctuations could materially impact our revenues and earnings A disruption in the supply of energy components or raw materials whether due to market conditions legislative or regulatory actions natural events or other disruption could prevent us from meeting our contractual commitments and harm our business and financial results Our supply of crude helium for purification and resale is largely dependent upon natural gas production by crude helium suppliers Lower natural gas production resulting from natural gas pricing dynamics supplier operating or transportation issues or other interruptions in sales from crude helium suppliers can reduce our supplies of crude helium available for processing and resale to customers We typically contract to passthrough cost increases in energy and raw materials to customers but cost variability can still have a negative impact on our results We may be unable to raise prices as quickly as costs rise or competitive pressures may prevent full recovery of such costs Increases in energy or raw material costs that cannot be passed on to customers for competitive or other reasons may negatively impact our revenues and earnings Even where costs are passed through price increases can cause lower sales volume 11 Table of Contents Catastrophic events could disrupt our operations or the operations of our suppliers or customers having a negative impact on our business financial results and cash flows Our operations could be impacted by catastrophic events outside our control including severe weather conditions such as hurricanes floods earthquakes storms epidemics or acts of war and terrorism Any such event could cause a serious business disruption that could affect our ability to produce and distribute products and possibly expose us to thirdparty liability claims Additionally such events could impact our suppliers or customers which could cause energy and raw materials to be unavailable to us or our customers to be unable to purchase or accept our products and services Any such occurrence could have a negative impact on our operations and financial results New technologies create performance risks that could impact our financial results or reputation We are continually developing and implementing new technologies and product offerings Existing technologies are being implemented in products and designs or at scales beyond our experience base These technological expansions can create nontraditional performance risks to our operations Failure of the technologies to work as predicted or unintended consequences of new designs or uses could lead to cost overruns project delays financial penalties or damage to our reputation Large scale gasification projects may contain processes or technologies that we have not operated at the same scale or in the same combination and although such projects generally include technologies and processes that have been demonstrated previously by others such technologies or processes may be new to us and may introduce new risks to our operations Legislative regulatory and societal responses to global climate change create financial risk We are the worlds leading supplier of hydrogen the primary use of which is the production of ultralow sulfur transportation fuels that have significantly reduced transportation emissions and helped improve human health To make the high volumes of hydrogen needed by our customers we use steam methane reforming which releases carbon dioxide Some of our operations are within jurisdictions that have or are developing regulatory regimes governing emissions of greenhouse gases GHG including carbon dioxide These include existing coverage under the European Union Emission Trading system the California cap and trade schemes Albertas Carbon Competitiveness Incentive Regulation Chinas Emission Trading Scheme South Koreas Emission Trading Scheme nationwide expansion of the China Emission Trading Scheme revisions to the Alberta regulation and Environment Canadas developing Output Based Pricing System In addition the US Environmental Protection Agency EPA requires mandatory reporting of GHG emissions and is regulating GHG emissions for new construction and major modifications to existing facilities Some jurisdictions have various mechanisms to target the power sector to achieve emission reductions which often result in higher power costs Increased public concern may result in more international US federal andor regional requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of GHG Although uncertain these developments could increase our costs related to consumption of electric power and hydrogen production We believe we will be able to mitigate some of the increased costs through contractual terms but the lack of definitive legislation or regulatory requirements prevents an accurate estimate of the longterm impact these measures will have on our operations Any legislation that limits or taxes GHG emissions could negatively impact our growth increase our operating costs or reduce demand for certain of our products Our financial results may be affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings including those involving antitrust tax environmental or other matters We are subject to litigation and regulatory investigations and proceedings in the normal course of business and could become subject to additional claims in the future some of which could be material While we seek to limit our liability in our commercial contractual arrangements there are no guarantees that each contract will contain suitable limitations of liability or that limitations of liability will be enforceable Also the outcome of existing legal proceedings may differ from our expectations because the outcomes of litigation including regulatory matters are often difficult to predict reliably Various factors or developments can lead us to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible to reasonable estimates such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment a significant settlement significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law A future adverse ruling settlement or unfavorable development could result in charges that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows in any particular period 12 Table of Contents Costs and expenses resulting from compliance with environmental regulations may negatively impact our operations and financial results We are subject to extensive federal state local and foreign environmental and safety laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions in the air discharges to land and water and the generation handling treatment and disposal of hazardous waste and other materials We take our environmental responsibilities very seriously but there is a risk of environmental impact inherent in our manufacturing operations and in the transportation of our products Future developments and more stringent environmental regulations may require us to make additional unforeseen environmental expenditures In addition laws and regulations may require significant expenditures for environmental protection equipment compliance and remediation These additional costs may adversely affect financial results For a more detailed description of these matters see Item 1  Business Environmental Controls above Implementation of the United Kingdoms UK exit from European Union EU membership could adversely affect our European Operations The UKs exit from EU membership may adversely affect customer demand our relationships with customers and suppliers and our European business Although it is unknown what the terms of the United Kingdoms future relationship with the EU will be it is possible that there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the United Kingdom and EU members and increased regulatory complexities Any of these factors could adversely affect customer demand our relationships with customers and suppliers and our European business Inability to compete effectively in a segment could adversely impact sales and financial performance We face strong competition from large global competitors and many smaller regional ones in many of our business segments Introduction by competitors of new technologies competing products or additional capacity could weaken demand for or impact pricing of our products negatively impacting financial results In addition competitors pricing policies could affect our profitability or market share A change of tax law in key jurisdictions could result in a material increase in our tax expense The multinational nature of our business subjects us to taxation in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions Due to economic and political conditions tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change The companys future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation Changes to income tax laws and regulations in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate or in the interpretation of such laws could significantly increase our effective tax rate and adversely impact our financial condition results of operations or cash flows In December 2017 the US enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act the Tax Act which significantly revised the US federal corporate income tax law by among other things lowering the corporate income tax rate implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a onetime tax on unremitted cumulative nonUS earnings of foreign subsidiaries As a result of the Tax Act we recorded a discrete net tax expense of 1806 for fiscal 2018 including a reduction in the deemed repatriation tax related to the taxation of deemed foreign dividends that may be eliminated by future legislation Various levels of government are increasingly focused on tax reform and other legislative action to increase tax revenue Further changes in tax laws in the US or foreign

intellectual property insurance and regulatory matters Although litigation with respect to these matters is routine and incidental to the conduct of our business such litigation could result in large monetary awards especially if compensatory andor punitive damages are awarded However we believe that litigation currently pending to which we are a party will be resolved without any material adverse effect on our financial position earnings or cash flows From time to time we are also involved in proceedings investigations and audits involving governmental authorities in connection with environmental health safety competition and tax matters The Company is a party to proceedings under CERCLA the RCRA and similar state and foreign environmental laws relating to the designation of certain sites for investigation or remediation Presently there are 32 sites on which a final settlement has not been reached where the Company along with others has been designated a potentially responsible party by the Environmental Protection Agency or is otherwise engaged in investigation or remediation including cleanup activity at certain of its current and former manufacturing sites We do not expect that any sums we may have to pay in connection with these environmental matters would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position Additional information on the Companys environmental exposure is included under Item 1 Business Environmental Controls In September 2010 the Brazilian Administrative Council for Economic Defense CADE issued a decision against our

million at 30 September 2018  on Air Products Brasil Ltda This fine was based on a recommendation by a unit of the Brazilian Ministry of Justice whose investigation began in 2003 alleging violation of competition laws with respect to the sale of industrial and medical gases The fines are based on a percentage of the Companys total revenue in Brazil in 2003 We have denied the allegations made by the authorities and filed an appeal in October 2010 to the Brazilian courts On 6 May 2014 our appeal was granted and the fine against Air Products Brasil Ltda was dismissed CADE has appealed that ruling and the matter remains pending The Company with advice of its outside legal counsel has assessed the status of this matter and has concluded that although an adverse final judgment after exhausting all appeals is possible such a judgment is not probable As a result no provision has been made in the consolidated financial statements Other than this matter we do not currently believe there are any legal proceedings individually or in the aggregate that are reasonably possible to have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows However a future charge for regulatory fines or damage awards could have a significant impact on our net income in the period in which it is recorded 15 Table of Contents ITEM 4 MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES Not applicable PART II
