significant changes will occur 3 Table of Contents Narrative Description of Business by Segments Industrial Gases Business The Companys Industrial Gases business produces atmospheric gases oxygen nitrogen argon and rare gases process gases hydrogen helium carbon dioxide carbon monoxide syngas and specialty gases and equipment for the production or processing of gases such as air separation units and noncryogenic generators Atmospheric gases are produced through various air separation processes of which cryogenic is the most prevalent Process gases are produced by methods other than air separation For example hydrogen is produced by steam methane reforming of natural gas or by purifying byproduct sources obtained from the chemical and petrochemical industries and helium is produced as a byproduct of gases extracted from underground reservoirs primarily natural gas but also carbon dioxide purified before resale The Companys Industrial Gases business is organized and operated regionally The regional Industrial Gases segments Americas EMEA and Asia supply gases and related equipment in the relevant region to diversified customers in many industries including those in metals glass chemical processing electronics energy production and refining food processing metallurgical industries medical and general manufacturing Hydrogen is used by refiners to facilitate the conversion of heavy crude feedstock and lower the sulfur content of gasoline and diesel fuels The chemicals industry uses hydrogen oxygen nitrogen carbon monoxide and syngas as feedstocks in the production of many basic chemicals The energy production industry uses nitrogen injection for enhanced recovery of oil and natural gas and oxygen for gasification Oxygen is used in combustion and industrial heating applications including in the steel certain nonferrous metals glass and cement industries Nitrogen applications are used in food processing for freezing and preserving flavor and nitrogen for inerting is used in various fields including the metallurgical chemical and semiconductor industries Helium is used in laboratories and healthcare for cooling and in other industries for pressurizing purging and lifting Argon is used in the metals and other industries for its unique inerting thermal conductivity and other properties Industrial gases are also used in welding and providing healthcare and are utilized in various manufacturing processes to make them more efficient and to optimize performance We distribute gases to our customers through a variety of supply modes Liquid Bulk  Product is delivered in bulk in liquid or gaseous form by tanker or tube trailer and stored usually in its liquid state in equipment designed and installed typically by the Company at the customers site for vaporizing into a gaseous state as needed Liquid bulk sales are usually governed by three to fiveyear contracts Packaged Gases  Small quantities of product are delivered in either cylinders or dewars The Company operates packaged gas businesses in Europe Asia and Latin America In the United States the Companys packaged gas business sells products only for the electronics and magnetic resonance imaging principally helium industries OnSite Gases  Large quantities of hydrogen nitrogen oxygen carbon monoxide and syngas a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide are provided to customers principally the energy production and refining chemical and metallurgical industries worldwide who require large volumes of gases that have relatively constant demand Gases are produced at large facilities located adjacent to customers facilities or by pipeline systems from centrally located production facilities and are generally governed by 15 to 20 year contracts The Company also delivers small quantities of product through small onsite plants cryogenic or noncryogenic generators typically either via a 10 to 15 year sale of gas contract or through the sale of the equipment to the customer Electricity is the largest cost component in the production of atmospheric gases and natural gas is the principal raw material for hydrogen carbon monoxide and syngas production We mitigate energy and natural gas price fluctuations contractually through pricing formulas surcharges and cost passthrough arrangements During fiscal year 2016 no significant difficulties were encountered in obtaining adequate supplies of power and natural gas The regional Industrial Gases segments also include our share of the results of several joint ventures accounted for by the equity method The largest of these joint ventures operate in Mexico Italy South Africa India Saudi Arabia and Thailand 4 Table of Contents Each of the regional Industrial Gases segments competes against

nature of the electronics industry and to seasonal fluctuations in underlying enduse performance materials markets Working Capital Our working capital balance was a positive 1034 at 30 September 2016 The cash and cash items balance is higher than our historical trend and primarily results from transactions related to the anticipated spinoff of Versum and positive operating cash flows The Company maintains inventory where required to facilitate the supply of products to customers on a reasonable delivery schedule Industrial Gases inventory consists primarily of industrial gas specialty gas and crude helium inventories supplied to customers through liquid bulk and packaged gases supply modes Materials Technologies inventories consist primarily of bulk and packaged specialty gases and chemicals bulk and packaged performance chemical solutions and also include inventories to support sales of equipment and services Customers We do not have a homogeneous customer base or end market and no single customer accounts for more than 10 of our consolidated revenues We do have concentrations of customers in specific industries primarily refining chemicals and electronics Within each of these industries the Company has several largevolume customers with longterm contracts A negative trend affecting one of these industries or the loss of one of these major customers although not material to our consolidated revenue could have an adverse impact on the affected segment Governmental Contracts No segments business is subject to a government entitys renegotiation of profits or

forwardlooking information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10K or presented elsewhere by management from time to time you should carefully read the following risk factors Any of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forwardlooking statements are made and could adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock as well While we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business there may be additional risks and uncertainties that adversely affect our business performance or financial condition in the future that are not presently known are not currently believed to be significant or are not identified below because they are common to all businesses Overall Economic and SupplyDemand Conditions Customer VitalityA weakening economy or product supply versus demand imbalance in markets in which the Company does business may decrease the demand for its goods and services and adversely impact its revenues operating results and cash flows Cyclical downturns in the industries served by our customers or adverse economic events or conditions affecting specific customers can in turn have an adverse effect on our business Demand for the Companys products and services depends in part on the general economic conditions affecting the countries and markets in which the Company does business In the past few years uncertain economic conditions in certain geographies and changing supply and demand balances in markets served by the Company have impacted and may in the future impact demand for the Companys products and services in turn negatively impacting the Companys revenues and earnings Unfavorable conditions can depress sales in a given market or to a particular customer affect our margins constrain our operating flexibility impact utilization of the Companys manufacturing capacity or result in charges which are unusual or nonrecurring Excess capacity in the Companys or its competitors manufacturing facilities could decrease the Companys ability to maintain pricing and generate profits Our operating results in one or more segments may also be affected by uncertain or deteriorating economic conditions particularly germane to that segment or to particular customer markets within that segment A decline in the industries served by our customers or adverse events or circumstances affecting individual customers can impair the ability of such customers to satisfy their obligations to the Company resulting in uncollected receivables unanticipated contract terminations project delays or inability to recover plant investments negatively impacting our financial results Weak overall demand or specific customer conditions may also cause elimination of product lines customer shutdowns or default or other inabilities to profitably operate facilities and may force sale or abandonment of facilities and equipment or projects not to reach onstream These or other events associated with weak economic conditions or specific end market product or customer events may require the Company to record an impairment on tangible assets such as facilities and equipment or intangible assets such as intellectual property or goodwill which would have a negative impact on its financial results Operational Economic Political and Legal Risks of International OperationsThe Companys foreign operations can be adversely impacted by operational economic political and legal risks that could impact our profitability Developing market operations present special risks The Company has extensive international operations In addition the Company is actively investing significant capital and other resources in emerging markets including joint ventures and other alliances The Companys operations in certain foreign jurisdictions may be subject to project delays due to unanticipated government actions inadequate investment in infrastructure undeveloped property rights and legal systems or political instability Some of the Companys contractual relationships within these jurisdictions are subject to cancellation without full compensation for loss Economic and political conditions within foreign jurisdictions nationalization and expropriation risk social unrest strained relations between countries or imposition of international sanctions can cause fluctuations in demand price volatility supply disruptions or loss of property The occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse impact on the Companys financial condition results of operation and cash flows Our developing market operations may be subject to greater risks than those faced by our operations in mature economies including geopolitical legal economic and talent risks Our success will depend in part on our ability 10 Table of Contents to manage the risks inherent in operating in a developing market including unfamiliar regulatory environments relationships with local partners language and cultural differences and tailoring products for acceptance by local markets Further our operations outside the United States require us to comply with a number of United States and international regulations including anticorruption laws such as the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act the United Kingdom Bribery Act and the China AntiUnfair Competition Law as well as US and international economic sanctions We have policies and procedures to foster compliance with these laws including compliance and training programs for our employees and established due diligence procedures with regard to third parties however these cannot eliminate the risk that violations could be committed by our employees agents or joint venture partners Violations of such laws and regulations could result in disruptive investigations of the Company significant fines and sanctions which could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations Currency FluctuationsChanges in foreign currencies may adversely affect the Companys financial results The majority of the Companys revenue is generated from sales outside the United States exposing it to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates Our Industrial Gases business is primarily exposed to translational currency risk as the results of its foreign operations are translated into US dollars at current exchange rates throughout the fiscal period Our Performance Materials business is also significantly exposed to transactional currency impacts as many of its products are manufactured in one country and sold in another The Company uses certain financial instruments to mitigate some of these effects The Companys policy is to minimize cash flow volatility from changes in currency exchange rates The Company chooses not to hedge the translation of its foreign subsidiaries earnings into dollars Accordingly reported sales net earnings cash flows and fair values have been and in the future will be affected by changes in foreign exchange rates For a more detailed discussion of currency exposure see Item 7A below Raw Material and Energy Cost and AvailabilityInterruption in ordinary sources of supply or an inability to recover increases in energy and raw material costs from customers could result in lost sales or reduced profitability Hydrocarbons including natural gas are the primary feedstock for the production of hydrogen carbon monoxide and syngas Energy including electricity natural gas and diesel fuel for delivery trucks is the largest cost component of the Companys business Because the Companys industrial gas facilities use substantial amounts of electricity energy price fluctuations could materially impact the Companys revenues and earnings A disruption in the supply of energy components or raw materials whether due to market conditions legislative or regulatory actions natural events or other disruption could prevent the Company from meeting its contractual commitments harming its business and financial results The Companys supply of crude helium for purification and resale is largely dependent upon natural gas production by crude helium suppliers Lower natural gas production which may result from natural gas pricing or supplier operating issues or interruptions in sales from other crude helium suppliers can reduce the Companys supplies of crude helium available for processing and resale to its customers The Company typically contracts to pass through cost increases in energy and raw materials to its customers but cost variability can still have a negative impact on its results The Company may not be able to raise prices as quickly as costs rise or competitive pressures may prevent full recovery Increases in energy or raw material costs that cannot be passed on to customers for competitive or other reasons would negatively impact the Companys revenues and earnings Even where costs are passed through price increases can cause lower sales volume Regulatory ComplianceThe Company is subject to extensive government regulation in jurisdictions around the globe in which it does business Changes in regulations addressing among other things environmental compliance importexport restrictions antibribery and corruption and taxes can negatively impact the Companys financial condition results of operation and cash flows The Company is subject to government regulation in the United States and foreign jurisdictions in which it conducts its business The application of laws and regulations to the Companys business is sometimes unclear 11 Table of Contents Compliance with laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in business practice that could result in reduced profitability Determination of noncompliance can result in penalties or sanctions that could also impact financial results Compliance with changes in laws or regulations can require additional capital expenditures or increase operating costs Export controls or other regulatory restrictions could prevent the Company from shipping its products to and from some markets or increase the cost of doing so Export restrictions continue to attract external focus by multiple customs and export enforcement authorities Changes in tax laws and regulations and international tax treaties could affect the financial results of the Companys businesses Increasingly aggressive enforcement of antibribery and anticorruption requirements including the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act the United Kingdom Bribery Act and the China AntiUnfair Competition Law could subject the Company to criminal or civil sanctions if a violation occurs Environmental ComplianceCosts and expenses resulting from compliance with environmental regulations may negatively impact the Companys operations and financial results The Company is subject to extensive federal state local and foreign environmental and safety laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions in the air discharges to land and water and the generation handling treatment and disposal of hazardous waste and other materials The Company takes its environmental responsibilities very seriously but there is a risk of environmental impact inherent in our manufacturing operations and transportation of chemicals Future developments and more stringent environmental regulations may require the Company to make additional unforeseen environmental expenditures In addition laws and regulations may require significant expenditures for environmental protection equipment compliance and remediation These additional costs may adversely affect financial results For a more detailed description of these matters see Narrative Description of the Companys Business GenerallyEnvironmental Controls above We may not be able to successfully control or reduce costs to improve productivity and streamline operations Reorganization and cost reduction efforts can disrupt operations Achieving our financial goals including continued profitability and margin growth depends significantly on our efforts to control or reduce our operating costs including our ability to eliminate stranded costs related to our divested businesses Because many of our costs are affected by factors outside or substantially outside our control we generally must seek to control or reduce costs through operating efficiency and repositioning actions If we are not able to identify and execute efforts designed to control or reduce costs and increase operating efficiency our ability to attain our goals could be adversely impacted Ongoing restructuring and cost reduction actions may reduce our available talent and other resources impact our ability to attract and retain key employees slow improvements in our products and services and adversely affect our ability to respond to customers Failure to achieve targeted improvements may diminish the operational and financial benefits we realize from such actions These circumstances could adversely impact our business and financial statements Interest Rate IncreasesThe Companys earnings cash flows and financial position can be impacted by interest rate increases and access to credit At 30 September 2016 the Company had total consolidated debt of 62252 million including Versum debt of 9972 million of which 13071 million including Versum debt of 58 million will mature in the next twelve months The Company expects to continue to incur indebtedness to fund new projects and replace maturing debt Although the Company actively manages its interest rate risk through the use of derivatives and diversified debt obligations not all borrowings at variable rates are hedged and new debt will be priced at market rates If interest rates increase the Companys interest expense could increase significantly affecting earnings and reducing cash flow available for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and other purposes In addition changes by any rating agency to the Companys outlook or credit ratings could increase the Companys cost of borrowing and weaken our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us For a more detailed discussion of interest rate risk see Item 7A below We may be unable to successfully execute or effectively integrate acquisitions and divestitures may not occur as planned We regularly review our portfolio of businesses and pursue growth through acquisitions and seek to divest noncore businesses We may not be able to complete transactions on favorable terms on a timely basis or at all In 12 Table of Contents addition our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by the failure of acquired businesses to meet expected returns the failure to integrate acquired businesses the inability to dispose of noncore assets and businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions and the discovery of unanticipated liabilities or other problems in acquired businesses for which we lack contractual protections or insurance With respect to divested businesses our results may be impacted by claims by purchasers to whom we have provided contractual indemnification Catastrophic EventsCatastrophic events could disrupt the Companys operations or the operations of its suppliers or customers having a negative impact on the Companys business financial results and cash flows The Companys operations could be impacted by catastrophic events outside the Companys control including severe weather conditions such as hurricanes floods earthquakes storms epidemics or acts of war and terrorism Any such event could cause a serious business disruption that could affect the Companys ability to produce and distribute its products and possibly expose it to thirdparty liability claims Additionally such events could impact the Companys suppliers or customers in which event energy and raw materials may be unavailable to the Company or its customers may be unable to purchase or accept the Companys products and services Any such occurrence could have a negative impact on the Companys operations and financial results Operational RisksOperational and execution risks may adversely affect the Companys operations or financial results The Companys operation of its facilities pipelines and delivery systems inherently entails hazards that require continuous oversight and control such as pipeline leaks and ruptures fire explosions toxic releases mechanical failures or vehicle accidents If operational risks materialize they could result in loss of life damage to the environment or loss of production all of which could negatively impact the Companys ongoing operations reputation financial results and cash flows In addition the Companys operating results are dependent on the continued operation of its production facilities and its ability to meet customer requirements which depends in part on the Companys ability to properly maintain and replace aging assets Operating results are also dependent on the Companys ability to complete new construction projects on time on budget and in accordance with performance requirements which depends in part on the availability of adequate sources of labor in the geographies where the Company intends to build new plants Failure to do so may expose the Company to loss of revenue potential litigation and loss of business reputation Information SecurityThe security of the Companys Information Technology systems could be compromised which could adversely affect its ability to operate We depend on information technology to enable us to operate efficiently and interface with customers as well as to maintain financial accuracy and efficiency Our information technology capabilities are delivered through a combination of internal and external services and services providers If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure we could be subject to transaction errors processing inefficiencies the loss of customers business disruptions or the loss of or damage to our confidential business information or multiple site impact through a security breach As with all large systems our information systems could be penetrated by outside parties intent on extracting information corrupting information disrupting business processes or causing harm to persons or property The Companys systems have in the past been and likely will in the future be subject to sophisticated cyber security threats To date the Company is not aware of any significant impact on its operations or financial results from such attempts however unauthorized access could disrupt our business operations result in the loss of assets and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations The Companys business involves the use storage and transmission of information about its employees vendors and customers The protection of such information as well as the Companys information is critical to the Company The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding with the frequent imposition of new and constantly changing requirements The Company has established policies and procedures to help protect the security and privacy of this information The Company also from time to time exports sensitive customer data and technical information to recipients outside the United States Breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or our customers including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud trickery or other forms of deception 13 Table of Contents could expose us our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information result in litigation and potential liability for us damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business Litigation and Regulatory ProceedingsThe Companys financial results may be affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings including those involving antitrust tax environmental or other matters The Company is subject to litigation and regulatory investigations and proceedings in the normal course of business and could become subject to additional claims in the future some of which could be material While the Company seeks to limit its liability in its commercial contractual arrangements there are no guarantees that each contract will contain suitable limitations of liability or that limitations of liability will be enforceable at law Also the outcome of existing legal proceedings may differ from the Companys expectations because the outcomes of litigation including regulatory matters are often difficult to predict reliably Various factors or developments can lead the Company to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible to reasonable estimates such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment a significant settlement significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law A future adverse ruling settlement or unfavorable development could result in charges that could have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition results of operations and cash flows in any particular period Greenhouse GasesLegislative and regulatory responses to global climate change create financial risk Some of the Companys operations are within jurisdictions that have or are developing regulatory regimes governing emissions of greenhouse gases GHG These include existing coverage under the European Union Emission Trading Scheme Californias cap and trade scheme Albertas Emission Reduction Program Chinas Emission Trading Scheme pilots South Koreas Emission Trading Scheme and mandatory reporting and anticipated constraints on GHG emissions under an Ontario cap and trade scheme nationwide expansion of the China Emission Trading Scheme and federal emission performance standards in Canada In addition the US Environmental Protection Agency EPA requires mandatory reporting of GHG emissions and is regulating GHG emissions for new construction and major modifications to existing facilities Moreover some jurisdictions have various mechanisms to target the power sector eg US EPA Clean Power Plan to achieve emission reductions These reductions often result in higher power costs Increased public concern may result in more international US federal andor regional requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of GHG Although uncertain these developments could increase the Companys costs related to consumption of electric power hydrogen production and fluorinated gases production The Company believes it will be able to mitigate some of the increased costs through its contractual terms but the lack of definitive legislation or regulatory requirements prevents an accurate estimate of the longterm impact on the Company Any legislation that limits or taxes GHG emissions could impact the Companys growth increase its operating costs or reduce demand for certain of its products The results of the United Kingdoms UK European Union EU membership referendum could adversely affect customer demand our relationships with customers and suppliers and our business and financial statements The results of the UKs EU membership referendum advising for the exit of the UK from the EU has caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in global stock markets currency exchange rate fluctuations and global economic uncertainty which could adversely affect customer demand our relationships with customers and suppliers and our business and financial statements CompetitionInability to compete effectively in a segment could adversely impact sales and financial performance The Company faces strong competition from several large global competitors and many smaller regional ones in many of its business segments Introduction by competitors of new technologies competing products or additional capacity could weaken demand for or impact pricing of the Companys products negatively impacting financial results In addition competitors pricing policies could affect the Companys profitability or its market share 14 Table of Contents We could incur significant liability if the distribution of Versum common stock to our stockholders is determined to be a taxable

investigations and audits involving governmental authorities in connection with environmental health safety competition and tax matters The Company is a party to proceedings under the Comprehensive

relating to the designation of certain sites for investigation or remediation Presently there are approximately 33 sites on which a final settlement has not been reached where the Company along with others has been designated a potentially responsible party by the Environmental Protection Agency or is otherwise engaged in investigation or remediation including cleanup activity at certain of its current and former manufacturing sites We do not expect that any sums we may have to pay in connection with these environmental matters would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position Additional information on the Companys environmental exposure is included under Narrative Description of the Companys Business GenerallyEnvironmental Controls In September 2010 the Brazilian Administrative Council for Economic Defense CADE issued a decision against our Brazilian subsidiary Air Products Brasil Ltda and several other Brazilian industrial gas companies for alleged anticompetitive activities CADE imposed a civil fine of R1792 million approximately 55 million at 30 September 2016 on Air Products Brasil Ltda This fine was based on a recommendation by a unit of the Brazilian Ministry of Justice whose investigation began in 2003 alleging violation of competition laws with respect to the sale of industrial and medical gases The fines are based on a percentage of the Companys total revenue in Brazil in 2003 We have denied the allegations made by the authorities and filed an appeal in October 2010 to the Brazilian courts On 6 May 2014 our appeal was granted and the fine against Air Products Brasil Ltda was dismissed CADE has appealed that ruling and the matter remains pending The Company with advice of its outside legal counsel has assessed the status of this matter and has concluded that although an adverse final judgment after exhausting all appeals is possible such a judgment is not probable As a result no provision has been made in the consolidated financial statements Other than this matter we do not currently believe there are any legal proceedings individually or in the aggregate that are reasonably possible to have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows A future charge for regulatory fines or damage awards could have a significant impact on our net income in the period in which it is recorded 17 Table of Contents ITEM 4 SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS Not applicable PART II
