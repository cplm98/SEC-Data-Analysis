In this Annual Report on Form 10K the Company we or our refer to A M Castle  Co a Maryland corporation and its subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements except as otherwise indicated or as the context otherwise requires Company Overview AM Castle  Co the Company is a global distributor of specialty metals and supply chain services principally serving the producer durable equipment commercial and military aircraft heavy equipment industrial goods and construction equipment sectors of the global economy Its customer base includes many Fortune 500 companies as well as thousands of medium and smallersized firms spread across a variety of industries Particular focus is placed on the aerospace and defense power generation mining heavy industrial equipment and general manufacturing industries as well as general engineering applications The Companys corporate headquarters is located in Oak Brook Illinois As of December 31 2020 the Company operates out of 21 service centers located throughout North America 16 Europe 2 and Asia 3 The Companys service centers hold inventory and process and distribute products to both local and export markets 2 Table of Contents Industry and Markets Service centers operate as supply chain intermediaries between primary producers which deal in bulk quantities in order to achieve economies of scale and endusers in a variety of industries that require specialized products in significantly smaller quantities and forms Service centers also manage the differences in lead times that exist in the supply chain While original equipment manufacturers OEM and other customers often demand delivery within hours the lead time required by primary producers can range from several months to over a year for certain specialty metals Service centers provide value to customers by aggregating purchasing providing warehousing and distribution services to meet specific customer needs including demanding delivery times and precise metal specifications and by providing valueadded metals processing services The principal markets served by the Company are highly competitive The Company is focused on two key global end markets aerospace and industrial Competition within these markets is based on service quality processing capabilities inventory availability timely delivery ability to provide supply chain solutions and price The Company competes in a highly fragmented industry Competition in the various markets in which the Company participates comes from a large number of valueadded metals processors and service centers on a local regional and global basis some of which have greater financial resources and some of which have more established brand names in certain local regional and global markets served by the Company The Company also competes to a lesser extent with primary metals producers who typically sell to larger customers requiring shipments of large volumes of metal with limited or no valueadded processing In order to capture scale efficiencies and remain competitive many primary metal producers are consolidating their operations and focusing on their core production activities These producers have increasingly outsourced metals distribution inventory management and valueadded metals processing services to metals service centers This process of outsourcing allows the primary metal producers to work with a relatively small number of intermediaries rather than many end customers As a result metals service centers including the Company are now providing an expanding range of services for their customers including metal purchasing processing and supply chain solutions The Companys marketing strategy focuses on distributing highlyengineered specialty grades and alloys of metals as well as providing specialized processing services designed to meet very precise specifications Core products include alloy and stainless steels nickel alloys aluminum titanium and carbon Inventories of these products may assume many forms such as plate sheet extrusions round bar hexagonal bar square and flat bar tubing and coil Depending on the size of the facility and the nature of the markets it serves the Companys service centers are equipped as needed with bar saws plate saws oxygen and plasma arc flame cutting machinery trepanning machinery boring machinery honing equipment waterjet cutting equipment stress relieving and annealing furnaces leveling and surface grinding equipment CNC machinery and sheet shearing equipment Various specialized fabrications are also performed for customers internally or through prequalified subcontractors that thermally process turn polish cuttolength and straighten alloy and carbon bar among other things Procurement The Company purchases metals from many producers Material is purchased in large lots and stocked at its service centers until sold usually in smaller quantities and typically with some valueadded processing services performed The Companys ability to provide timely delivery of a wide variety of specialty metals products along with its processing capabilities and supply chain management solutions allows customers to lower their own inventory investment by reducing their need to order the large quantities required by producers and their need to perform additional material processing services Some of the Companys purchases are covered by longterm contracts and commitments which generally have corresponding customer sales agreements 3 Table of Contents Thousands of customers from a wide array of industries are serviced primarily through the Companys own sales organization Orders are primarily filled with materials shipped from Company stock The materials required to fill the balance of sales are obtained from other sources such as purchases from other distributors or direct mill shipments to customers Deliveries are made principally by third party logistics providers using their fleets some of which display Companybranding Otherwise common carrier delivery is used in areas not serviced directly by such third party logistics providers The Companys broad network of locations provides same or nextday delivery to most of their markets and twoday delivery to substantially all of the remaining target markets Customers The Companys customer base is broadly diversified and therefore the Company does not have dependence upon any single customer or a few customers The customer base includes many Fortune 500 companies as well as thousands of medium and smallersized firms Employees As of December 31 2020 the Company had 681 fulltime employees Of these fulltime employees 80 were represented by the United Steelworkers of America USW under collective bargaining agreements Effective May 15 2018 we entered into a fouryear collective bargaining agreement with the USW which covers approximately 59 employees at our largest facility in Cleveland Ohio Approximately 21 employees at our Hammond Indiana facility are covered by a separate collective bargaining agreement with the USW that was renegotiated effective September 1 2020 and expires on March 31 2024 The Company believes its relationships with its employees and their representative unions are good Access to SEC Filings The Company makes available free of charge on or through its Web site at wwwcastlemetalscom the Annual

except per share data Our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows are subject to various risks many of which are not exclusively within our control that may cause actual performance to differ materially from historical or projected future performance You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below in addition to other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10K including our consolidated financial statements and related notes Any of the following risks as well as other risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows Capital Resources Our substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our debt instruments We have substantial debt service obligations As of December 31 2020 we had 2387 million of total debt outstanding all of which is secured The debt outstanding in order of priority was comprised of 1156 million of borrowings under our Revolving Credit and Security Agreement as amended the ABL Credit Agreement 988 million aggregate principal amount of 300  500 Convertible Senior Secured Paid In Kind PIK Toggle Notes due 2024 the 300500 Convertible Notes including 01 million of restricted 300500 Convertible Notes issued to certain members of management MIP Notes 40 million aggregate principal amount of 500  700 Convertible Senior Secured Paid In Kind PIK Toggle Notes due 2022 the 500700 Convertible Notes and together with the 300500 Convertible Notes the Convertible Notes and shortterm borrowings of approximately 30 million under a local credit facilities see Note 2  Debt We also have a Paycheck Protection Program Term Note due April 28 2022 in the amount of 100 million the PPP Loan and our French subsidiarys term loan in the amount of 74 million the France Term Loan Our debt instruments currently limit our ability to pay in cash the interest accruing on our Convertible Notes so the amount of Convertible Notes outstanding continues to increase quarterly as interest is paid in kind The ABL Credit Agreement and the Convertible Notes are secured by collateral security interests in substantially all of our assets and are guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries Our substantial level of indebtedness could have significant effects on our business including the following  it may be more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations  our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures strategic acquisitions or general corporate purposes may be impaired  we must use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay interest on our indebtedness which will reduce the funds available to use for operations and other purposes including potentially accretive acquisitions  our ability to fund a change of control offer under our debt instruments may be limited  our substantial level of indebtedness could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that may have proportionately less debt or could affect our ability to secure favorable contracts with certain customers or suppliers  our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate may be limited and 6 Table of Contents  our substantial level of indebtedness may make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business The ABL Credit Agreement provides for 1250 million senior secured revolving credit facility the Revolving A Credit Facility as well as a subordinated 250 million Revolving B Priority senior secured revolving credit facility the Revolving B Priority Credit Facility and a subordinated 215 million Revolving B senior secured revolving credit facility the Revolving B Credit Facility and together with the Revolving A Credit Facility and the Revolving B Priority Credit Facility the Credit Facilities We expect to obtain the funds to pay our expenses and to satisfy our debt obligations from our operations and available resources under the Credit Facilities Our ability to meet our expenses and make these principal and interest payments as they come due therefore depends on our future performance which will be affected by financial business economic and other factors many of which we cannot control Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future and our anticipated revenue and cash flow may not be realized either or both of which could result in our being unable to repay indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs If we do not have enough funds we may be required to refinance all or part of our then existing debt sell assets or borrow more funds which we may not be able to accomplish on terms acceptable to us or at all In addition the terms of existing or future debt agreements may restrict us from pursuing any of these alternatives which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our existing debt service obligations and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our debt agreements which may not be successful Our total debt under our ABL Credit Agreement the Convertible Notes including MIP Notes the PPP Loan our France Term Loan and our local credit facilities have an aggregate principal amount outstanding of 2387 million as of December 31 2020 Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our future financial condition and operating performance which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business and other factors beyond our control Therefore we may not be able to maintain or realize a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we may be forced to reduce or delay investments capital expenditures or potentially accretive acquisitions sell assets seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous borrowing covenants which could further restrict our business operations The terms of existing or future debt instruments may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity Our debt instruments impose significant operating and financial restrictions which may prevent us from pursuing certain business opportunities and taking certain actions and our failure to comply with the covenants contained in our debt instruments could result in an event of default that could adversely affect our operating results Our debt agreements impose and future debt agreements may impose operating and financial restrictions on us These restrictions limit or prohibit among other things our ability to  incur additional indebtedness or issue disqualified capital stock  pay dividends redeem subordinated debt or make other restricted payments  make certain investments or acquisitions 7 Table of Contents  grant or permit certain liens on our assets  enter into certain transactions with affiliates  merge consolidate or transfer substantially all of our assets  create or permit restrictions on dividends loans asset transfers or other distributions to us from certain of our subsidiaries  transfer sell or acquire assets and  change the business we conduct These covenants could adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general engage in or expand business activities including future opportunities that may be in our interest and plan for or react to market conditions or otherwise execute our business strategies A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default in respect of the related indebtedness If a default occurs in certain circumstances the relevant lenders or holders of such indebtedness could elect to declare the indebtedness together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable and proceed against any collateral securing that indebtedness If the maturity of our indebtedness is accelerated we may not have sufficient cash resources to satisfy our debt obligations and may not be able to continue our operations as planned COVID19 Our business and operations and the operations of our suppliers and customers have been and for an indefinite period of time may continue to be adversely affected by the novel coronavirus or COVID19 pandemic and could be impacted in the future by other pandemics known or unknown We may face risks related to the ongoing outbreak of the Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 COVID19 which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization and a national public health emergency by governments throughout the world as the disease spread across the globe and continues to substantially and materially impact worldwide economic activity The continuing impact of COVID19 and the associated pandemic is unknown and continues to evolve Health epidemics or outbreaks of communicable diseases such as COVID19 could result in widespread or localized health crises that could adversely affect general commercial activity and the economies and financial markets of many countries or localities in which the Company operates sells or purchases good and services A public health epidemic including COVID19 poses the risk that we or our employees contractors suppliers customers transportation providers and other business partners may from time to time be prevented or impaired from conducting ordinary course business activities for indefinite periods of time either at specific branches or on a broader scale including due to shutdowns necessitated for the health and wellbeing of our employees the employees of our business partners or shutdowns that may be requested or mandated by governmental authorities Directives to dedensify worksites Shelter in Place Safe at Home quarantine or similar orders or mandates that restrict workforce andor require closures of nonessential businesses have been implemented by government authorities to one degree or another starting with China in January 2020 and quickly spreading in the following months through Europe North America and most locations throughout the world Such orders or mandates have been lifted in many geographies but there is a continuing threat that such measures may again be required as the original COVID19 virus or variants thereof have continued to spread in certain geographies While vaccines are now available and being administered in certain geographies the quantities are limited and are generally reserved at this time for healthcare workers first responders longterm care facility staff and residents people 65 years or older other individuals with significant health concerns and essential workers Although the Company has already been adversely impacted by the COVID19 pandemic the situation is very fluid and subject to rapid change the full extent of the impact that the COVID19 pandemic may yet have on 8 Table of Contents the Companys business operations and financial condition is currently unknown Future pandemics could have similar or more severe impacts to our business and operations While our branches have as a whole generally remained operational at varying levels of volume throughout the pandemic there can be no assurances that from time to time we will not have to close any branch or multiple branches for indefinite periods of time due to concerns over the health and wellbeing of our employees due to further developments in government directives or due to continued drop in demand from our customers or disruptions from our suppliers While we have implemented policies and practices to protect our employees at each of our locations including sanitizing and cleaning protocols requiring face coverings and other personal protective equipment social distancing and other behavioral best practices remote work arrangements staggered and spaced work shifts separating workspaces by distance andor physical barriers and suspending nonessential employee travel and visitors to our locations throughout the world there can be no assurances that these efforts will be successful to prevent a contamination from impacting or potentially closing any of our branches or corporate offices for a time While each of our operations has prepared and regularly updates customized business continuity and return to work plans to address COVID19 concerns in an effort to ensure that we are protecting our employees continuing to operate our business and service our customers needs and mitigating the potential impacts of COVID19 or other similar epidemics there is no guarantee that such plans will anticipate or fully mitigate the various impacts the pandemic much of which is still entirely uncertain While vaccines are expected to be more widely available in the coming months there can be no assurances as to how quickly the vaccines will be made available in sufficient quantities to mitigate the continuing economic effects of the pandemic and there can be no assurances that the vaccines will eradicate COVID19 and any variants While it is not possible at this time to estimate the scope and severity of the impact that COVID19 could yet have on our branches the continued spread of COVID19 including any variants the measures taken by the governments of countries affected the availability and efficacy of the COVID19 vaccinations actions taken to protect employees actions taken to continue operations and the impact of the pandemic on various business activities in affected countries could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows In April 2020 we applied for and received a 100 million PPP Loan see Item 8  Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Impact of Coronavirus COVID19 Pandemic At that time after taking into account among other things the disruptions to our business activities caused by the COVID19 pandemic our completed exchange offer to issue our 300500 Convertible Notes and shares of our common stock in exchange for our 500700 Convertible Notes  our available committed primary sources of liquidity and our lack of access to alternative sources of liquidity we believed and certified that economic conditions at that time made this loan request necessary and appropriate to support our ongoing US operations and mitigate potentially significant detriment to our business Recipients of loans in excess of 20 million will be audited and despite our goodfaith belief that given our circumstances we then satisfied and continue to satisfy all eligible requirements for the PPP Loan as well as all conditions for loan forgiveness The federal government may disagree and determine that we were ineligible to have applied for and received the PPP Loan andor ineligible for loan forgiveness either in full andor in part In such event we may be required to repay the PPP Loan in its entirety and could be subject to additional penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition While we have and continue to pursue government relief programs in addition to the PPP loan and the France Term Loan including tax deferrals subsidies loans etc and have and continue to implement a number of temporary and longterm costcutting initiatives to align our operations to current customer demand as well as be prepared for any market recovery once this pandemic has passed including staff reductions reduction in employee hours andor salaries furloughs temporary layoffs or a combination of these actions At each of our locations there can be no assurances that such actions will be sufficient to stave off the economic impacts of the pandemic or that further such actions will not be warranted Although we have seen recent improvements we saw a significant reduction in customer forecasts and orders in 2020 as a result of the pandemic and there can be no assurances that we will not see further degradation in customer business in the short or longterm and it is uncertain how quickly customer forecasts and business will improve following this pandemic 9 Table of Contents Our principal sources of liquidity are cash provided by operations and proceeds from borrowings under the Credit Facilities Starting in the second quarter of 2020 and continuing into the second half of 2020 the average receivable days outstanding increased from levels in previous quarters which we believe reflects some slowing in payments from customers due to the financial uncertainties resulting from the COVID19 pandemic We also have a lower accounts receivable balance as of December 31 2020 as compared to previous years as a result of the decrease in demand resulting from the COVID19 pandemic which has decreased our borrowing base collateral attributable to accounts receivable under our Credit Facilities and in the near term could result in less cash provided by operations Further decreases in our accounts receivable could result in further reductions in our borrowing base collateral and therefore the maximum amount we could borrow under our Credit Facilities could decrease accordingly The decrease in demand has also resulted in an increase in inventory and average days sales in inventory in 2021 compared to previous years We are focused on maintaining liquidity by purchasing a sufficient level of inventory to meet customer demand while not carrying excess inventory and lowering overall stock levels throughout the business However if we are unable to sufficiently manage our inventory levels and we begin to carry excess inventory our liquidity could be unfavorably impacted Conversely a decrease in our inventory could result in a reduction in our borrowing base collateral attributable to inventory and therefore the maximum amount we could borrow under our revolving credit facility could decrease accordingly The full extent to which COVID19 impacts our business both in the shortterm and longterm will depend on the continuing severity location and duration of the spread of COVID19 and any variants as well as resurgent outbreaks of COVID19 which could result as communities reopen the short and longterm efficacy of the vaccines and the speed at which vaccinations are available and administered The extent of the impact will further depend on among other things the rate pace and effectiveness of the actions undertaken by local and world governments and health officials to contain the virus or treat its effects the nature of government public health guidelines and the publics adherence to those guidelines the impact of government economic relief on the US economy unemployment levels the success of businesses reopening the timing for proven treatments and vaccines for COVID19 consumer confidence and the rate pace and effectiveness of the actions undertaken by the leadership and employees of our Company as well as those of our suppliers customers and other business partners to return businesses to prepandemic levels Capitalization Our public reporting obligations have been suspended which could have an adverse impact on the market price and liquidity of our common stock and we filed documents with the SEC to terminate registration of our common stock with the SEC Effective as of December 29 2020 we effected a 1for10 reverse stock split the Reverse Split combining each 10 shares of our common stock into one whole share of common stock and paying cash in lieu of any fractional shares that otherwise would have resulted from the Reverse Split As the Reverse Split resulted in a reduction in the number of stockholders of record to fewer than 300 on January 6 2021 we filed with the SEC a Certification and Notice of Termination of Registration Under Section 12g of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on Form 15 deregistering our common stock under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 As a result of this going private transaction our obligation to file periodic reports and other information with the SEC including our quarterly and annual reports has been suspended Prior to the Reverse Split and the going private transaction our common stock was traded on the OTCQX Best Market the OTCQX under the ticker CTAM It is anticipated that the trading of our common stock will shift to the OTC Pink Open Market a centralized electronic quotation service for overthecounter securities OTC Pink is the baseline tier of the OTC Markets and has no financial standards or reporting requirements and companies in this tier choose the level of information they provide to investors and may have current limited or no public disclosure However OTC Pink is not a stock exchange and we do not have the ability to control whether our shares are quoted on OTC Pink Trading opportunities in OTC Pink will be dependent upon whether any brokerdealers commit to continue making a market for our common stock Accordingly we cannot guarantee that our common stock will continue to be quoted on OTC Pink In addition any prices at which our 10 Table of Contents shares are quoted on the OTC Pink if at all may be more or less than the price of our common stock prior to deregistration In addition the spread between the bid and asked prices of our common stock on the OTC Pink may be wider than before deregistration and the liquidity of our shares may be lower There can be no assurances that there will be any OTC Pink quotations for our common stock or that if such quotations continue they will continue for any length of time There can be no assurances that any trading market for our common stock at the OTC or otherwise will continue Even if trading on the OTC Pink continues the trading of our common stock in the OTC market rather than a national securities exchange may negatively impact the trading price of our common stock and the levels of liquidity available to our stockholders Securities traded in the OTC market generally have less liquidity due to factors such as the reduced number of investors that will consider investing in the securities the reduced number of market makers in the securities and the reduced number of securities analysts that follow such securities As a result holders of shares of our common stock may find it difficult to resell their shares at prices quoted in the market or at all After the deregistration of our common stock and suspension of our duty to file periodic reports and other information with the SEC information regarding the Company including our financial results that has previously been available to the general public and our stockholders will no longer be readily available subject in all respects to a continuing stockholders right if any to certain information regarding the Company under Maryland law The lack of publicly available information about the Company could result in a reduction of our profile with key stakeholders such as lenders vendors customers investors and employees The limited or absences of any trading market and the limited or absence of public information about our operations and results of operations may result in a decline in the price of our common stock and may result in reduced liquidity for our common stock Furthermore because of the limited market and generally low volume of trading in our common stock that could occur the share price of our common stock could be more likely to be affected by broad market fluctuations general market conditions fluctuations in our operating results changes in the markets perception of our business and announcements made by us our competitors or parties with whom we have business relationships The lack of liquidity in our common stock may also make it difficult for us to issue additional securities for financing or other purposes or to otherwise arrange for any financing we may need in the future Ownership of our stock is concentrated which may limit stockholders ability to influence corporate matters The Companys ownership is concentrated among a small group of institutional investors and the Companys management team Certain directors their affiliates andor any other concentrated ownership interests may have the voting power to substantially affect or control the outcome of matters requiring a stockholder vote including the election of directors and the approval of significant corporate matters Such a concentration of control could adversely affect the market price of our common stock or prevent a change in control or other business combinations that might be beneficial to us The lender under our Credit Facilities andor the holders of our Convertible Notes can require us to repay our debt obligations following a change of control We may not have sufficient funds to satisfy such cash obligations As of December 31 2020 we had 1155 million of borrowings under our Credit Facilities and 1027 million of aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Convertible Notes including 01 million of MIP Notes Upon the occurrence of a change in control as defined in the ABL Credit Agreement or a fundamental change as defined in the indenture for the Convertible Notes which in either case includes the acquisition of more than 50 of our outstanding voting power by a person or group we may be required to repay all borrowings under the Credit Facilities andor repurchase some or all of the Convertible Notes for cash at a repurchase 11 Table of Contents price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes being repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest We may not have sufficient funds to satisfy such cash obligations and in such circumstances may not be able to arrange the necessary financing on favorable terms or at all In addition our ability to satisfy such cash obligations will be restricted pursuant to covenants contained in the indenture for the Convertible Notes and will be permitted to be paid only in limited circumstances We may also be limited in our ability to satisfy such cash obligations by applicable law or the terms of other instruments governing our indebtedness Our inability to make any cash payments that may be required to satisfy the obligations described above would trigger an event of default under the Convertible which in turn could constitute an event of default under our other outstanding indebtedness thereby potentially resulting in the acceleration of certain of such indebtedness the prepayment of which could further restrict our ability to satisfy such cash obligations Holders of our Convertible Notes may convert their Convertible Notes into common stock at any time or in connection with a fundamental change The conversion of our Convertible Notes into common stock will dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholders Pursuant to the terms of the Convertible Notes Indenture we may elect to settle any election to convert Convertible Notes in cash common stock or a combination of both however our debt instruments currently limit our ability to pay cash in respect of the Convertible Notes Any issuance by us of our common stock upon conversion of our Convertible Notes will dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholders In addition any such issuance of common stock could have a dilutive effect on our net income per share to the extent that the average stock price during the period is greater than the conversion prices and exercise prices of the Convertible Notes Furthermore any sales in the public market of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock We have various mechanisms in place that may prevent a change in control that stockholders may otherwise consider favorable We are subject to the antitakeover provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law the MGCL that prohibit us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of five years after the date of the transaction in which the person first becomes an interested stockholder unless the business combination or stockholder interest is approved in a prescribed manner The application of these and certain other provisions of our charter or the MGCL could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock The provisions of our debt instruments also contain limitations on our ability to enter into change of control transactions In addition the repurchase rights in our Convertible Notes triggered by the occurrence of a fundamental change as defined in the indenture for the Convertible Notes and the additional shares of our common stock by which the conversion rate is increased in connection with certain fundamental change transactions as described in the indenture for the Convertible Notes could discourage a potential acquirer Our Business Our future operating results are impacted by the volatility of the prices and supply of metals which could cause our results to be adversely affected The availability and prices we pay for metal raw materials and the prices we charge for products may fluctuate depending on many factors including general economic conditions both domestic and international competition production levels import tariffs duties and other trade restrictions new or ongoing health and safety issues and currency fluctuations To the extent metal prices decline we would generally expect lower sales pricing and possibly lower operating income Depending on the timing of the price changes and to the extent we are not able to pass on to our customers any increases in our metal raw materials prices our operating results may be adversely affected In addition because we maintain substantial inventories of metals in order to meet short leadtimes and the justintime delivery requirements of our customers a reduction in our selling prices could result in lower profitability or in some cases losses either of which could adversely impact 12 Table of Contents our ability to remain in compliance with certain provisions of our debt instruments as well as result in us incurring impairment charges We service industries that are highly cyclical and impacted by international regulatory concerns and any downturn in our customers industries could reduce our revenue and profitability Many of our products are sold to customers in industries that experience significant fluctuations in demand based on economic conditions energy prices consumer demand availability of adequate credit and financing customer inventory levels changes in governmental policies andor regulations and other factors beyond our control such as acts of war or terrorism natural disasters or public health issues or pandemics such as that experienced with the COVID19 pandemic As a result of this volatility in the industries we serve when one or more of our customers industries experiences a decline we may have difficulty increasing or maintaining our level of sales or profitability if we are not able to divert sales of our products to customers in other industries Historically we have made a strategic decision to focus sales resources on certain industries specifically the aerospace heavy equipment machine tools and general industrial equipment industries A downturn in these industries has had and may in the future continue to have an adverse effect on our operating results We are also particularly sensitive to market trends in the manufacturing sectors of the North American economy and the two primary global markets which we serve aerospace and industrial For example in October 2018 and March of 2019 two commercial aircraft accidents led to the grounding by the Federal Aviation Administration FAA and other regulatory bodies of the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft  While our overall participation on the 737 MAX program is relatively limited both through direct sales and through our customer base certain of our aerospace customers have significant content on the aircraft The continued grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX by the FAA and other regulators which started in March of 2019 caused deliveries of that aircraft to be extremely limited in fiscal year 2020  and has therefore impacted our customers in some cases significantly On November 18 2020 the FAA approved the Boeing 737 MAX to return to commercial service and in some cases the aircraft resumed flying before the end of 2020 although a widespread return to service is not expected until 2021 Based on information currently available we believe the missed deliveries resulting from the prolonged grounding of the aircraft will be fulfilled in future periods although at a slower rate than previously estimated Because Boeing sources large quantities of metal directly from mills for certain of its programs including the 737 MAX there could be impacts on our suppliers and market availability of certain products as a result of excesses or shortages As stated above our direct exposure to the 737 MAX is relatively limited and therefore we do not expect it to have a significant direct impact on sales demand or pricing of our products in 2021 However we cannot exclude the possibility that a further prolonged grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX could affect our aerospace end markets more broadly than the specific 737 MAX program and thus could negatively impact our profitability andor cash flow Our operating results are subject to the seasonal nature of our customers businesses A portion of our customers experience seasonal slowdowns Historically our revenues in the months of July November and December have been lower than in other months because of a reduced number of shipping days and holiday or vacation closures for some customers Dependent on market and economic conditions our sales in the first two quarters of the year therefore can be higher than in the third and fourth quarters due to this seasonality As a result analysts and investors may inaccurately estimate the effects of seasonality on our operating results in one or more future quarters and consequently our operating results may fall below expectations 13 Table of Contents An impairment or additional restructuring charge could have an adverse effect on our operating results We continue to evaluate opportunities to reduce costs and improve operating performance These actions could result in restructuring and related charges including but not limited to asset impairments employee termination costs charges for pension benefits and pension settlement andor curtailments which could be significant and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations We have a significant amount of longlived assets We review the recoverability of longlived assets whenever significant events or changes occur which might impair the recovery of recorded costs making certain assumptions regarding future operating performance The results of these calculations may be affected by the current demand and any decline in market conditions for our products as well as interest rates and general economic conditions If impairment is determined to exist we will incur impairment losses which may have an adverse effect on our operating results Disruptions or shortages in the supply of raw materials could adversely affect our operating results and our ability to meet our customers demands Our business requires materials that are sourced from third party suppliers If for any reason our primary suppliers of metals should curtail or discontinue their delivery of raw materials to us at competitive prices and in a timely manner our operating results could suffer Unforeseen disruptions in our supply bases including those resulting from competition political instability acts of war or terrorism natural disasters and public health issues or pandemics such as COVID19 among other things could materially impact our ability to deliver products to customers The sourcing of certain metals may be highly competitive due to limited supplies and availability The number of available suppliers could be reduced by factors such as industry consolidation and bankruptcies affecting metals producers or suppliers may be unwilling or unable to meet our demand due to industry supply conditions If we are unable to obtain sufficient amounts of raw materials from our traditional suppliers we may not be able to obtain such raw materials from alternative sources at competitive prices to meet our delivery schedules which could have an adverse impact on our operating results To the extent we have quoted prices to customers and accepted orders for products prior to purchasing necessary raw materials or have existing contracts we may be unable to raise the price of products to cover all or part of the increased cost of the raw materials to our customers In some cases the availability of raw materials requires long lead times As a result we may experience delays or shortages in the supply of raw materials If we are unable to obtain adequate and timely deliveries of required raw materials we may be unable to timely supply customers with sufficient quantities of products This could cause us to lose sales incur additional costs or suffer harm to our reputation all of which may adversely affect our operating results Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards NOLs is limited We have incurred substantial losses since 2008 As of December 31 2020 we had United States US federal net operating loss carryforwards or NOLs of 243 million The US federal NOLs will expire in various years beginning with 2034 These US federal NOLs reflect the attribute reduction for the cancellation of indebtedness resulting from our bankruptcy proceedings in 2017 as well as the writeoff of the statutorily limited losses which the Company will never be able to utilize due to Internal Revenue Code IRC section 382 limitations We have determined that an ownership shift of greater than fifty percent occurred in 2015 2016 and 2017 and as such a significant portion of the preownership shift NOLs are subject to an annual utilization limitation under IRC section 382 that will act to prevent the Company from utilizing most of its losses against future taxable income We may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership that we cannot predict or control that could result in further limitations being placed on our ability to utilize our federal NOLs In addition we may not generate future taxable income so that we can use our available NOLs as an offset As of December 31 2020 we have a full valuation allowance against our federal and state NOLs that we do not expect to utilize under IRC section 382 as we have concluded based 14 Table of Contents on all available evidence that it is more likely than not that we will not utilize these federal and state NOLs prior to their respective expiration We operate in international markets which expose us to a number of risks Although a majority of our business activity takes place in the United States we serve and operate in certain international markets which exposes us to political economic and currency related risks including the following  currency exchange risk  changes in tariffs duties and taxes  limitations on the repatriation of earnings  restrictions on imports and exports or sources of supply  transportation delays or interruptions  political social and economic instability and disruptions  acts of terrorism or war natural disasters and other public health issues or pandemics  potential for adverse change in the local political or social climate or in government policies laws and regulations and  difficulty in staffing and managing geographically diverse operations and the application of foreign labor regulations In addition to the United States we operate in Canada Mexico France Singapore and China An act of war terrorism public health issues or a major pandemic event could disrupt international shipping schedules cause additional delays in importing or exporting products into or out of any of these countries including the United States or increase the costs required to do so In addition acts of crime or violence in these international markets could adversely affect our operating results Fluctuations in the value of the US dollar versus foreign currencies could reduce the value of these assets as reported in our consolidated financial statements which could reduce our stockholders equity If we do not adequately anticipate and respond to these risks and the other risks inherent in international operations it could have a material adverse impact on our operating results The imposition of tariffs or duties on imported metals could significantly increase the price of the metals we purchase from international suppliers andor result in shortages in the supply of raw materials Though we source the majority of our products domestically in the countries in which we operate we do source some products from international suppliers The imposition of tariffs or duties on imported metals other similar measures imposed by the US government and retaliatorycorresponding measure by other countries has a pervasive impact on the metals market in which we operate For example we may be unable to pass through the higher costs to our customers for the metals we buy internationally which could adversely impact our competitiveness financial condition and operating results Similarly further decreases in imports could cause a disruption or shortage in the availability of the raw materials that we buy which could limit our ability to meet customers demand or to purchase material at competitive prices This could cause us to lose sales incur additional costs or suffer harm to our reputation all of which may adversely affect our operating results 15 Table of Contents A portion of our workforce is represented by collective bargaining units which may lead to work stoppages As of December 31 2020 approximately 18 of our US employees were represented by the USW under collective bargaining agreements including hourly warehouse employees at our distribution centers in Cleveland Ohio and Hammond Indiana As these agreements expire there can be no assurance that we will succeed in concluding collective bargaining agreements with the USW to replace those that expire Although we believe that our labor relations have generally been satisfactory we cannot predict how stable our relationships with the USW will be or whether we will be able to meet the USW requirements without impacting our operating results and financial condition The USW may also limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce Work stoppages and instability in our relationship with the USW could negatively impact the timely processing and shipment of our products which could strain relationships with customers or suppliers and adversely affect our operating results Effective May 15 2018 we entered into a fouryear collective bargaining agreement with the USW which covers approximately 59 employees at our largest facility in Cleveland Ohio Approximately 21 employees at our Hammond Indiana facility are covered by a separate collective bargaining agreement with the USW that was renegotiated effective September 1 2020 and expires on March 31 2024 We rely upon our suppliers as to the specifications of the metals we purchase from them We rely on mill or supplier certifications that attest to the physical and chemical specifications of the metals received from our suppliers for resale and generally consistent with industry practice do not undertake independent testing of all such metals Although our primary sources of products have been domestic suppliers we have and will continue to purchase product from foreign suppliers when we believe it is appropriate In the event that metal purchased from domestic suppliers is deemed to not meet quality specifications as set forth in the mill or supplier certifications or customer specifications we generally have recourse against these suppliers for both the cost of the products purchased and possible claims from our customers However such recourse will not compensate us for the damage to our reputation that may arise from substandard products and possible losses of customers Moreover there is a greater level of risk that similar recourse will not be available to us in the event of claims by our customers related to products from foreign suppliers that do not meet the specifications set forth in the mill or supplier certifications In such circumstances we may be at greater risk of loss for claims for which we do not carry or do not carry sufficient insurance Our business could be adversely affected by a disruption to our primary distribution hubs Our largest facilities in Cleveland Ohio Hammond Indiana and Janesville Wisconsin serve as primary distribution centers that ship product to our other facilities as well as external customers Our business could be adversely impacted by a major disruption at any of these facilities due to unforeseen developments occurring in or around the facility such as  damage to or inoperability of our warehouse or related systems  a prolonged power or telecommunication failure  a natural disaster environmental or public health issue or pandemic or an act of war or terrorism onsite A prolonged disruption of the services and capabilities of these or other of our facilities could adversely impact our operating results Damage to or a disruption in our information technology systems could impact our ability to conduct business and could subject us to liability for failure to comply with privacy and information security laws 16 Table of Contents Difficulties associated with the design and implementation of our enterprise resource planning ERP or other information technology systems could adversely affect our business our customer service and our operating results We rely primarily on one information technology system to provide inventory availability to our sales and operating personnel improve customer service through better order and product reference data and monitor operating results Difficulties associated with upgrades or integration with new systems could lead to business interruption that could harm our reputation increase our operating costs and decrease profitability General Risk Factors We could be vulnerable to interest rate fluctuations on our indebtedness which could hurt our operating results We are exposed to various interest rate risks that arise in the normal course of business Market risk arises from changes in interest rates We currently finance our operations with both fixed rate and variable rate borrowings and the fair market value of our 1499 million of fixed rate borrowings outstanding as of December 31 2020 may be impacted by changes in interest rates In addition if in the future interest rates subsequently increase significantly it could significantly increase the interest expense on our variable rate borrowings which could have an adverse effect on our operating results and liquidity Potential environmental legislative and regulatory actions could impose significant costs on the operations of our customers and suppliers which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows As a metals distributor our operations do not emit significant amounts of greenhouse gas GHG However the manufacturing processes of many of our suppliers and customers are energy intensive and generate carbon dioxide and other GHG emissions Any adopted future climate change and GHG legislative or regulatory measures may impose significant costs on the operations of our customers and suppliers and indirectly impact our operations Until the timing scope and extent of any future legislation and regulation becomes known we cannot predict the effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows Our business could be negatively impacted by cyber and other security threats or disruptions We face various cyber and other security threats including attempts to gain unauthorized access to our sensitive information and computer networks Unauthorized or inappropriate access to or use of our computer networks or systems may be intentional unintentional or a result of criminal activity Such unauthorized or inappropriate access may lead to the corruption of data which could cause interruption in our operations or damage our computer systems or those of our customers or vendors A party that is able to circumvent our security measures could also gain unauthorized access to confidential proprietary personal or other sensitive information or capabilities which may belong to third parties our employees or us The occurrence of such threats attacks or incidents exposes us to risk of loss and possible claims brought by our customers employees or other parties with whom we have commercial relationships as well as actions by government regulators In addition to potential legal liability these activities may interfere with our ability to provide our products and services Further a perception that our security measures are ineffective against security incidents could damage our reputation and we could lose employees customers or vendors Any of these occurrences could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations Thus the success of our business depends on the security of our computer networks and systems and in part on the security of the computer networks and systems of our thirdparty vendors Although we utilize various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate the risk of these threats there can be no assurance that these procedures and controls will be sufficient Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently we may be unable to anticipate these techniques 17 Table of Contents or to implement adequate preventative measures We also cannot give assurance that the security measures of our thirdparty vendors including network and system providers providers of customer and vendor support services and other vendors will be adequate Thus we may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by such breaches ITEM 1B  Unresolved Staff Comments None  18 Table of

believes that the amount of any judgment settlement or other outcome of these proceedings claims and inquiries after taking into account recorded accruals and the availability and limits of our
