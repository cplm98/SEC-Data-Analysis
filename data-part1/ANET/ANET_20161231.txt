PART I Item 1 Business We are a leading supplier of cloud networking solutions that use software innovations to address the needs of largescale Internet companies cloud service providers and nextgeneration data centers for enterprise support Our cloud networking solutions consist of our Extensible Operating System or EOS a set of network applications and our Ethernet switching and routing platforms Our cloud networking solutions deliver industryleading performance scalability availability programmability automation and visibility At the core of our cloud networking platform is EOS which was purposebuilt to be fully programmable and highly modular The programmability of EOS has allowed us to create a set of software applications that address the requirements of cloud networking including workflow automation network visibility and analytics and has also allowed us to rapidly integrate with a wide range of thirdparty applications for virtualization management automation orchestration and network services Since we began shipping our products we have grown rapidly and according to Crehan Research we have achieved the second largest market share in data center 10254050100 Gigabit Ethernet switch ports excluding blade switching sold in 2016 EOS supports leading cloud and virtualization solutions including VMware NSX Microsoft System Center OpenStack and other cloud management frameworks We have worked with industry leaders to define new open protocols for the virtualized data center We coauthored the VXLAN protocol specification with VMware and were the first to demonstrate VXLAN integration and have now expanded VXLAN routing and integration We use standard Linux as our underlying operating system providing customers with access to all Linux operating system facilities This allows customers to extend our EOS software with offtheshelf Linux applications and a growing number of open source management tools EOS has a highly modular architecture which allows us to prevent network outages in deployments of our cloud networking solutions This architecture also allows us to rapidly develop new features and protocols without compromising the quality of the existing code base Because all of our platform products are powered by the same binary image of EOS we are able to deliver these new innovations to our entire installed base with minimal disruption EOS a software platform for network programmability and automation provides an advanced level of programmability allowing customers to take advantage of prebuilt and custom EOS applications as well as integration with a wide range of technology partner solutions In 2015 we introduced CloudVision a networkwide approach for workload orchestration and workflow automation delivering a turnkey solution for cloud networking We believe CloudVisions abstraction of the physical network to this broader networkwide perspective allows for a more efficient approach for several operational usecases related to automation visibility management security and 3 rd party controller integration We sell our products through both our direct sales force and our channel partners Since shipping our first products in 2008 our cumulative endcustomer base has grown rapidly Between December 31 2011 and December 31 2016  our cumulative endcustomer base grew from approximately 1100 to over 4200  Our end customers span a range of industries and include large Internet companies service providers financial services organizations government agencies media and entertainment companies and others Our customers include six of the largest cloud services providers based on annual revenue 5 Table of Contents We have experienced rapid revenue growth over the last several years increasing our revenue at a compound annual growth rate of 519 from 1398 million in 2011 to 11 billion in 2016  For 2014 2015 and 2016 our revenue was 5841 million  8376 million and 11 billion  respectively with our 2016 revenue growing 348 when compared to 2015  Our net income has grown from 340 million in 2011 to 869 million  1211 million and 1842 million in 2014  2015  and 2016  respectively Industry Background Cloud computing is fundamentally changing the way IT infrastructure is built and how applications are delivered In cloud computing applications are distributed across thousands of servers These servers are connected with highspeed network switches that together form a pool of resources that allows applications to be rapidly deployed and costeffectively updated Cloud computing enables ubiquitous and ondemand network access to these applications from Internetconnected devices including personal computers tablets and smartphones Nearly all consumer applications today are delivered as cloud services Enterprise applications are rapidly moving to the cloud as well since cloud services are easier and more cost effective to deploy scale and operate than traditional applications Internet leaders like Amazon eBay Facebook Google Microsoft and Yahoo pioneered the development of largescale cloud data centers in order to meet the growing demands of their users including business customers Enterprises and service providers around the world are adopting cloud computing technologies in order to achieve similar performance improvements and cost reductions The aggregate network bandwidth in the cloud can be orders of magnitude higher than typical legacy data center networks Therefore the networks in such cloud environments must be architected and built in a new way We refer to these nextgeneration data center networks as cloud networks Cloud networks must deliver high capacity high availability and predictable performance and must be programmable to allow integration with thirdparty applications for network management automation orchestration and network services Limitations of Traditional Data Center Networks In our view cloud networks and legacy networks are fundamentally different In a traditional data center specific applications are installed on a small number of servers and most network traffic is servertoclient or northsouth traffic which results in perhaps a few terabitssecond of aggregate network bandwidth In the cloud most network traffic is servertoserver or eastwest traffic The aggregate network bandwidth in the cloud can exceed 1 petabitsecond orders of magnitude higher than that of typical legacy data center networks The much larger scale of cloud networks requires much higher network availability since network outages in the cloud are very expensive in terms of customer impact Traditional network switches have evolved and the features and capabilities of their operating system have expanded over many years without addressing the structural deficiencies of their underlying software architectures making it difficult to achieve high network switch reliability Some networking vendors have built products that use proprietary protocols to address the scaling needs of nextgeneration data centers However proprietary protocols are generally not acceptable to Internet companies or cloud service providers because they create vendor lockin Legacy networks are not programmable and as a result are extremely difficult to integrate with thirdparty applications for network management automation orchestration and network services This lack of integration forces customers to continue to rely on time consuming errorprone manual processes that may be costprohibitive Requirements for Cloud Networking Cloud networks differ in many aspects from legacy networks including capacity performance scale availability programmability automation visibility security and cost performance The requirements for cloud networking include the following  Capacity Performance and Scalability Cloud networks must have sufficient capacity to interconnect large numbers of servers up to hundreds of thousands with predictable network bandwidth  High Availability Cloud networks must overcome hardware and software failures for customers in order to avoid network outages that can result in lost revenue dissatisfied customers and increased operational cost  Open and Programmable Cloud networks must be based on open protocols and be programmable to enable integration with leading network applications and management and data analysis tools  Workflow Automation Cloud networks must offer automated provisioning and configuration to enable fast service delivery and to minimize operational costs avoiding timeconsuming and errorprone manual processes for configuring provisioning monitoring and managing the network  Network Visibility Cloud networks must provide IT administrators with realtime indepth visibility of network status to proactively monitor detect and notify when issues arise  Security Cloud networks require dynamic security and services from physicaltophysical and physicaltovirtual workloads 6 Table of Contents  Cost Performance Cloud networks must deliver high performance while lowering overall cost of ownership including capital and operational costs Our Cloud Networking Solutions We are a leading supplier of cloud networking solutions that use software innovations to address the needs of largescale Internet companies cloud service providers and nextgeneration enterprise data centers Our cloud networking platform was purposebuilt to address the functional and performance requirements for cloud networks We deliver our solutions via our industryleading 10254050100 Gigabit Ethernet switches and routers optimized for nextgeneration data center networks Our cloud networking solutions consist of EOS our Extensible Operating System a set of networking applications and our Gigabit Ethernet platforms At the core of our cloud networking platform is EOS which was architected to be fully programmable and highly modular The programmability of EOS has allowed us to create a set of software applications and application programming interfaces or APIs that address the requirements of cloud networking including workflow automation network visibility and analytics and has further allowed us to integrate rapidly with a wide range of thirdparty applications for virtualization management automation orchestration and network services The key benefits of our cloud networking solutions are as follows Capacity Performance and Scalability Our cloud networking platform enables data center networks to scale to hundreds of thousands of physical servers and millions of virtual machines with the least number of switching tiers We achieve this by leveraging standard protocols to meet the scale requirements of cloud computing We have used activeactive Layer 2 and Layer 3 network topologies to enable customers to build extremely large and resilient networks High Availability Our highly modular EOS software architecture was designed to be faultisolating and selfhealing in order to deliver higher stability compared to legacy network operating systems In addition our customers can nondisruptively upgrade our switches running in the network using our Smart System Upgrade or SSU application Open and Programmable Our EOS software was purposebuilt to offer programmable interfaces throughout all levels of our software This has allowed us to integrate our cloud networking platform with a wide range of leading thirdparty applications For example we support VMware NSX OpenStack and Microsoft System Center for orchestration and fast provisioning enabling true workload mobility and automatic provisioning of physical switches We enable customers through application programming interfaces to write their own scripts to customize

enterprises to provision networking resources in minutes with no manual intervention through our Zero Touch Provisioning We also natively support Ansible CFEngine Chef Puppet virtual network orchestration applications and thirdparty management tools CloudVision a networkwide approach for workload orchestration and workflow automation delivers a turnkey solution for cloud networking CloudVision extends the same EOS architectural approach across the network for state topology monitoring and visibility This enables enterprises to move to cloudclass automation without needing significant internal development Finally EOS embraces the DevOps model which is a software development method that combines development and operations to provision and monitor servers storage and network resources in a unified fashion Network Visibility Our EOS software provides a set of tools and applications that proactively monitor detect and notify network managers when network issues arise delivering realtime data to thirdparty management applications including Corvil ExtraHop Riverbed and Splunk to provide detailed application visibility Our telemetry applications include VM Tracer which provides visibility down to the virtual machine level Path Tracer which detects errors in provisioned network paths MapReduce Tracer which monitors and optimizes the performance of Hadoop workloads and Health Tracer which monitors infrastructure resiliency Our network visibility applications provide realtime insight into the status of the network They include LANZ which monitors latency and DANZ 2017 a set of features previously only available in addon network visibility devices which provides advanced traffic monitoring with flow analysis and timestamps plus the ability to perform tap aggregation for reporting and analysis 7 Table of Contents Security MacroSegmentation Services MSS is one of the services enabled via Arista CloudVision Since CloudVision maintains a networkwide database of all state within the network as well as direct integration with hypervisor resources like VMware vSphere and NSX It is aware of every workload that is within the network and it learns in real time about new devices or workloads that are added or removed from the network or moved across ports or servers Macrosegmentation extends the concept of finegrained interhypervisor security to cloud networks by enabling dynamic security and services for physical to virtual workloads Macrosegmentation security is a complement to finegrained security delivered via microsegmentation that is already implemented in the virtual switch of the physical host on which a VM is running Lower Total Cost of Ownership Our cloud networking platform offers architectural and system advantages that provide our customers with costeffective and highly available cloud networking solutions Our programmable scalable leafspine architectures combined with industryleading applications significantly reduce networking costs when compared to legacy network designs enabling faster time to service and improved availability Our automation tools reduce the operational costs of provisioning managing and monitoring a data center network and speed up service delivery Our visibility tools provide high levels of visibility into complex network environments without the need for additional data collection equipment As a result fewer network engineers are needed to operate large networks Our Market Opportunity We compete primarily in the data center switching market for 10 Gigabit Ethernet and above excluding blade switches We believe that cloud computing represents a fundamental shift from traditional legacy data centers and that cloud networking is the fastest growing segment within the data center switching market As organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud architectures spending on cloud and nextgeneration data centers has increased rapidly over the last several years while traditional legacy IT spending has been growing more slowly In 2017 our 7150 7050 7250 7300 and 7500 Series platforms are now listed on the U S Department of Defense Approved

Arista 7500E Series in 2013 An overview of our switchingrouting portfolio is shown in the figure below We use multiple silicon architectures across our products which allows us to build a broader range of products optimized for different functions in the network than competitors that utilize fewer silicon architectures While we use multiple silicon architectures all of our platforms are powered with the same binary EOS image which significantly simplifies deployment and ensures the same rich feature set and consistent operation across all our products Our Extensible Operating System The core of our cloud networking platform is our Extensible Operating System or EOS which runs on top of standard Linux and offers programmability at all layers of the stack All of our 10254050100 Gigabit Ethernet platforms run our EOS software EOS is based on a new and innovative architecture that is highly modular and consists of more than 100 separate processes that we call agents each one handling specific protocol processing device driver or system management functions Each agent runs in user space as a separate Linux process and is completely protected and isolated from all other agents We are constantly investing in our core infrastructure to provide the capabilities required for building modern cloud networks most recently by extending SysDB into NetDB and enhancing scalability New requirements use in cloud and service provider networks and hybrid cloud deployments in enterprises require ongoing upgrades and extensions to our state oriented architecture EOS Attributes The modular and programmable architecture of EOS enables us to offer a set of attributes capabilities and features that are essential for cloud networking and nextgeneration data centers High Availability EOS is selfhealing in the sense that individual processes can be restarted without impacting application traffic This architectural design principle supports selfhealing resiliency in our software easier software maintenance and module independence higher software quality overall and faster timetomarket for new features that customers require Programmable at All Layers EOS is programmable at all layers from the Linux kernel to switch configuration provisioning automation and detailed monitoring of the network Public cloud providers have leveraged tools such as the EOS Software Development Kit SDK and eAPI to implement fully customized infrastructure automation solutions 9 Table of Contents Workflow Visibility Through EOS we have developed a wide range of applications available to our customers for purchase as additional licenses that enable enhanced network monitoring and visibility without requiring additional external monitoring devices This includes i DataANalyZer DANZ which provides access to raw network data for analysis by security troubleshooting and performance management tools ii Latencyloss ANalyZer LANZ which provides access to internal network performance loads and packet loss and latency occurring at the microsecond level iii Network Telemetry which provides network state information including correlations with dynamic state of the systems operating on the network such as Hypervisors distributed job controls and iv Network Tracers which provide active integration and diagnostics for various workload conditions dependent upon network performance Network Automation EOS supports Puppet Chef and Ansible which enables automatic network configuration in the same manner as servers and storage In addition EOS provides tools that greatly reduce network operational costs Another major component of network automation is Cloud Vision CloudVision CloudVisions abstraction of the physical network to a broader networkwide perspective allows for a more efficient approach for several operational usecases including the following highlights  Centralized representation of distributed network state allowing for a single point of integration and networkwide visibility and analytics  Controller agnostic support for physical and virtual workload orchestration through open APIs such as OVSDB JSON and Openstack plugins  Turnkey automation for zero touch provisioning configuration management and networkwide upgrades and rollback  Compliance Dashboard for Security Audit and patch management  Realtime Streaming for Telemetry and Network Analytics a modern approach to replace legacy polling per device  Provides visibility and troubleshooting for underlay and overlay networks and  Enables MacroSegmentation Services which provides a dynamic and scalable network service to logically insert security devices into the path of traffic regardless of whether the security device or workload is physical or virtual and with complete flexibility on placement of security devices and workloads LeafSpine Network Designs Our customers typically deploy leafspine network topologies consisting of leaf switches or topofrack switches located in the server rack connected with uplinks to multiple loadsharing spine switches and routers that provide the backbone Our leafspine network designs scale up to more than 300000 physical servers and millions of virtual machines using Equal Cost Multiple Path or ECMP to load balance Layer 3 network traffic across multiple spine switches and routers With MultiChassis Link Aggregation or MLAG we can build an activeactive Layer 2 network that can connect more than 25000 physical servers Our leafspine network designs have been widely deployed and provide predictable network bandwidth and latency A key advantage of predictable network performance is that it eliminates the need to optimize the network for specific applications which means a single network design works equally well for all applications Enterprise resources commonly span multiple datacenters or Performance Optimized Datacenters or PODs within a data center including the public cloud The drive to deliver resources quickly affordably and reliably also drives the need for a flexible costeffective scaleout design at the datacenter core which we refer to as the spine of spines or Universal Spine The Universal Spine is nonblocking supports large scale ECMP IP routing and routing convergence The Universal Spine enables architects to build the network around the spine and collapse legacy networking layers into the Universal Spine 10 Table of Contents Examples of our leafspine and universal leafspine architectures are illustrated below Customer Support and Services We have designed our customer support offerings to provide our customers with high levels of support Our global team of support engineers engages directly with client IT teams and is available at all times over email by

forums Sales and Marketing We market and sell our products through our direct sales force and in partnership with our channel partners including distributors valueadded resellers systems integrators and OEM partners We also sell in conjunction with various technology partners To facilitate channel coordination and increase productivity we have created a partner program the Arista Partner Program to engage partners who provide valueadded services and extend our reach into the marketplace Authorized training partners perform technical training of our channel partners and end customers Our partners commonly receive an order from an end customer prior to placing an order with us and we confirm the identification of the end customer prior to accepting such orders Our partners generally do not stock inventory received from us Our sales organization is supported by systems engineers with deep technical expertise and responsibility for presales technical support and solutions engineering for our end customers systems integrators original equipment manufacturers or OEMs and channel partners A pool of shared channel sales and marketing representatives also supports these teams Each sales team is responsible for a geographical territory has responsibility for a number of major direct endcustomer accounts or has assigned accounts in a specific vertical market We have field sales teams operating in over 80 countries Our marketing activities consist primarily of technology conferences web marketing trade shows product demonstrations seminars and events public relations analyst relations demand generation and direct marketing to build our brand increase endcustomer awareness communicate our product advantages and generate qualified leads for our field sales force and channel partners Research and Development We believe our future success depends on our ability to develop new products and features that address the needs of our end customers Our inhouse engineering personnel are responsible for the development quality documentation support and release of our products We plan to continue to invest significantly in resources to conduct our research and development efforts Our research and development expense was 2736 million 2094 million and 1489 million in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively Manufacturing We subcontract the manufacturing of all of our products to various contract manufacturers Our primary manufacturing partners are Jabil Circuit Sanmina Corporation and Foxconn This approach allows us to reduce our costs manufacturing overhead and inventory position and allows us to adjust more quickly to changing endcustomer demand We require all of our manufacturing locations to be ISO9001 certified Our EOS software is installed on our products at one of three direct fulfillment facilities Our contract manufacturing partners procure the majority of the components needed to build our products and assemble our products according to our design specifications This allows us to leverage the purchasing power of our contract manufacturing partners 11 Table of Contents We retain complete control over the bill of material test procedures and quality assurance programs Our onsite personnel work closely with our partners and review on an ongoing basis forecasts inventory levels processes capacity yields and overall quality Our contract manufacturing partners procure components and assemble our products based on our demand forecasts These forecasts represent our estimates of future demand for our products based upon historical trends and analyses from our sales and product management functions as adjusted for overall market conditions We update these forecasts monthly Our products rely on key components including merchant silicon integrated circuit components and power supplies purchased from a limited number of suppliers including certain sole source providers Generally neither our contract manufacturers nor we have a written agreement with any of these component providers to guarantee the supply of the key components used in our products nor do we have exclusive rights to such key components Our product development efforts also depend upon continued collaboration with our key suppliers including our merchant silicon vendors such as Broadcom and Intel As we develop our product roadmap and continue to expand our relationships with these and other merchant silicon vendors it is critical that we work in tandem with our key merchant silicon vendors to ensure that their silicon includes improved features and that our products take advantage of such improved features This enables us to focus our research and development resources on software core competencies and to leverage the investments made by merchant silicon vendors to achieve costeffective solutions Once the completed products are manufactured and tested our contract manufacturing partners ship them to various theatre direct fulfillment facilities in the United States the Netherlands and Singapore for final configuration quality control inspection and shipment to our distribution partners and end customers After the products are shipped to our end customers our products are installed by the end customers or by thirdparty service providers such as system integrators or value added resellers on their behalf Backlog We do not have any longterm purchase commitments from customers Customers generally order products on an asneeded basis with short lead and delivery times on a perpurchaseorder basis We maintain substantial finished goods inventory to ensure that products can generally be shipped shortly after receipt of an order A significant portion of our customer shipments in any fiscal year relate to orders received and shipped in that fiscal year Our customers utilize purchase orders containing nonbinding purchase commitments and we allow customers to cancel change or reschedule orders without penalty at any time prior to shipment and as a result we do not believe backlog is firm Due to the foregoing factors backlog is not a meaningful indicator in any given period of our ability to achieve any particular level of overall revenue or financial performance Competition The markets in which we compete are highly competitive and characterized by rapidly changing technology changing endcustomer needs evolving industry standards and frequent introductions of new products and services We expect competition to intensify in the future as the market for cloud networking expands and existing competitors and new market entrants introduce new products or enhance existing products The data center networking market has been historically dominated by Cisco Systems with competition also coming from other large network equipment and system vendors including Brocade Communications Systems which has entered into an agreement to be acquired by Broadcom DellEMC Hewlett Packard Enterprises and Juniper Networks Most of our competitors have made acquisitions andor have entered into or extended partnerships or other strategic relationships to offer more comprehensive product lines including cloud networking solutions For example in the last few years alone Dell acquired Force10 and EMC IBM acquired Blade Network Technology Hewlett Packard Enterprises purchased Aruba Juniper acquired Contrail Cisco acquired Insieme and Broadcom intends to acquire Brocade We also face competition from other companies and new market entrants including whitebox switch vendors as well as current technology partners and end customers who may develop network switches and cloud service solutions for internal use andor to broaden their portfolio of products The principal competitive factors applicable to our products include  breadth of product offerings and features  reliability and product quality  ease of use  pricing  total cost of ownership including automation monitoring and integration costs  performance and scale  programmability and extensibility  interoperability with other products  ability to be bundled with other vendor offerings and  quality of service support and fulfillment 12 Table of Contents We believe our products compete favorably with respect to these factors Our EOS software offers high reliability integrates with existing network protocols and is open and programmable We believe the combination of EOS a set of network applications and our 10254050100 Gigabit Ethernet platforms make our offering highly competitive for both cloud and enterprise data centers However many of our competitors have greater name recognition longer operating histories larger sales and marketing budgets and resources broader distribution and established relationships with channel partners and end customers greater access to larger endcustomer bases greater endcustomer support resources greater manufacturing resources the ability to leverage their sales efforts across a broader portfolio of products the ability to leverage purchasing power when purchasing subcomponents the ability to bundle competitive offerings with other products and services the ability to develop their own silicon chips the ability to set more aggressive pricing policies lower labor and development costs greater resources to make acquisitions larger intellectual property portfolios and substantially greater financial technical research and development or other resources Intellectual Property Our success and ability to compete depend substantially upon our core technology and intellectual property We rely on patent trademark and copyright laws trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements with our employees end customers resellers systems integrators and others to protect our intellectual property rights We file US and foreign patent applications to protect our intellectual property and believe that the duration of our issued patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products We cannot assure you that any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of a patent or whether the examination process will result in patents of valuable breadth or applicability In addition any patents that may be issued may be contested circumvented found unenforceable or invalidated and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing them We also license software from third parties for integration into our products including open source software and other software available on commercially reasonable terms We also own a number of trademarks in the US and other jurisdictions including Arista EOS CloudVision CloudStream CVP CVX Health Tracer MapReduce Tracer Path Tracer MXP MSS RAIL Score SPLINE SuperSpine SSU FlexRoute NetRollBack NetDB OSFP AlgoMatch MacroSegmentation MacroSegmentation Service We control access to and use of our software technology and other proprietary information through internal and external controls including contractual protections with employees contractors end customers and partners Our software is protected by US and international copyright patent and trade secret laws Despite our efforts to protect our software technology and other proprietary information unauthorized parties may still copy or otherwise obtain and use our software technology and other proprietary information In addition we intend to expand our international operations and effective patent copyright trademark and trade secret protection may not be available or may be limited in foreign countries Our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights If we become more successful we believe that competitors will be more likely to try to develop products that are similar to ours and that may infringe our proprietary rights It may also be more likely that competitors or other third parties will claim that our products infringe their proprietary rights In particular large and established companies in our industry have extensive patent portfolios and are regularly involved in both offensive and defensive litigation From time to time third parties including certain of these large companies and nonpracticing entities may assert patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property rights against us our channel partners or our end customers whom our standard license and other agreements obligate us to indemnify against such claims For example in December 2014 Cisco Systems filed two lawsuits against us in the Northern District of California for alleged patent and copyright infringement Additionally Cisco Systems filed two complaints against us in the International Trade Commission ITC for patent infringement and the ITC has initiated an investigation Please see Legal Proceedings included in Part I Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10K for a description of this litigation Successful claims of infringement by a third party if any could prevent us from distributing certain products or performing certain services require us to expend time and money to develop noninfringing solutions or force us to pay substantial damages royalties or other fees We cannot assure you that we do not currently infringe or that we will not in the future infringe upon any thirdparty patents or other proprietary rights Employees As of December 31 2016 we employed approximately 1500 fulltime employees None of our employees are represented by unions We consider our relationship with our employees to be good and have not experienced significant interruptions of operations due to labor disagreements Segment and Geographic Information We are organized

Form 10K which could materially affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects The risks described below are not the only risks facing us Risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry Our business and operations have experienced rapid growth and if we do not appropriately manage any future growth or are unable to improve our systems and processes our business financial condition results of operations and prospects will be adversely affected We have experienced rapid growth and increased demand for our products over the last several years which has placed a strain on our management administrative operational and financial infrastructure Our employee headcount and number of end customers have increased and we expect both to continue to grow over the next year For example between December 31 2011 and December 31 2016  our headcount grew from approximately 250 employees to approximately 1500 employees and our cumulative number of end customers grew from approximately 1100 to over 4200  As we have grown we have had to manage an increasingly large and more complex array of internal systems and processes to scale with all aspects of our business including our hardware and software development contract manufacturing and purchasing logistics and fulfillment and maintenance and support Our success will depend in part upon our ability to manage our growth effectively To do so we must continue to increase the productivity of our existing employees and continue to hire train and manage new employees as needed To manage domestic and international growth of our operations and personnel we will need to continue to improve our operational financial and management controls and our reporting processes and procedures and implement more extensive and integrated financial and business information systems We may not be able to successfully implement these or other improvements to our systems and processes in an efficient or timely manner and we may discover deficiencies in their capabilities or effectiveness We may experience difficulties in managing improvements to our systems and processes or in connection with thirdparty technology In addition our systems and processes may not prevent or detect all errors omissions or fraud Our failure to improve our systems and processes or their failure to operate effectively and in the intended manner may result in disruption of our current operations and endcustomer relationships our inability to manage the growth of our business and our inability to accurately forecast our revenue expenses and earnings and prevent certain losses Our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects and may increase the risk associated with your investment We shipped our first products in 2008 and the majority of our revenue growth has occurred since the beginning of 2010 Our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and our future prospects including our ability to plan for and model future growth We have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by rapidly growing companies in constantly evolving industries including the risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10K If we do not address these risks successfully our business financial condition results of operations and prospects will be adversely affected and the market price of our common stock could decline Further we have limited historical financial data and we operate in a rapidly evolving market As such any predictions about our future revenue and expenses may not be as accurate as they would be if we had a longer operating history or operated in a more predictable market Our results of operations are likely to vary significantly from period to period and be unpredictable and if we fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors or our previously issued financial guidance or if any forwardlooking financial guidance does not meet the expectation of analysts or investors the market price of our common stock could decline substantially Our results of operations have historically varied from period to period and we expect that this trend will continue As a result you should not rely upon our past financial results for any period as indicators of future performance Our results of operations in any given period can be influenced by a number of factors many of which are outside of our control and may be difficult to predict including  our ability to increase sales to existing customers and attract new end customers including large end customers  the budgeting cycles and purchasing practices of end customers including large end customers who may receive lower pricing terms due to volume discounts  the buying patterns of our large end customers in which large bulk purchases may or may not occur in certain quarters  the cost and potential outcomes of existing and future litigation including Cisco and Optumsoft litigation matters  our ability to comply with any remedial orders issued in connection with the Cisco litigation  the rate of expansion and productivity of our sales force  changes in our pricing policies whether initiated by us or as a result of competition  our inability to fulfill our end customers orders due to supply chain delays access to key commodities or technologies or events that impact our manufacturers or their suppliers  the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to the operation and expansion of our business  changes in endcustomer distributor or reseller requirements or market needs 15  deferral or cancellation of orders from end customers including in anticipation of new products or product enhancements announced by us or our competitors or warranty returns  the inclusion of any acceptance provisions in our customer contracts or any delays in acceptance of those products  changes in the growth rate of the networking market  the actual or rumored timing and success of new product and service introductions by us or our competitors or any other change in the competitive landscape of our industry including consolidation among our competitors or end customers  our ability to successfully expand our business domestically and internationally  our ability to increase the size of our distribution channel  decisions by potential end customers to purchase cloud networking solutions from larger more established vendors white box vendors or their primary network equipment vendors  price competition  insolvency or credit difficulties confronting our end customers which could adversely affect their ability to purchase or pay for our products and services or confronting our key suppliers including our sole source suppliers which could disrupt our supply chain  any disruption in our sales channel or termination of our relationship with important channel partners  seasonality or cyclical fluctuations in our markets  future accounting pronouncements or changes in our accounting policies  stockbased compensation expense  our overall effective tax rate including impacts caused by any reorganization in our corporate structure any changes in our valuation allowance for domestic deferred tax assets and any new legislation or regulatory developments  increases or decreases in our expenses caused by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as an increasing portion of our expenses are incurred and paid in currencies other than the US dollar  general economic conditions both domestically and in foreign markets and  other risk factors described in this Annual Report on Form 10K Any one of the factors above or the cumulative effect of several of the factors described above may result in significant fluctuations in our financial and other results of operations This variability and unpredictability could result in our failure to meet our revenue gross margins results of operations or other expectations contained in any forward looking financial guidance we have issued or the expectations of securities analysts or investors for a particular period If we fail to meet or exceed such guidance or expectations for these or any other reasons the market price of our common stock could decline substantially and we could face costly lawsuits including securities class action suits We expect large purchases by a limited number of end customers to continue to represent a substantial portion of our revenue and any loss or delay of expected purchases could result in material quartertoquarter fluctuations of our revenue or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations Historically large purchases by a relatively limited number of end customers have accounted for a significant portion of our revenue Many of these end customers make large purchases to complete or upgrade specific data center installations and are typically made on a purchaseorder basis rather than pursuant to longterm contracts Revenue from sales to Microsoft through our channel partner World Wide Technology Inc accounted for 16 of our revenue for the year ended December 31 2016  12 of our revenue for the year ended December 31 2015 and 15 of our revenue for the year ended December 31 2014  As a consequence of the concentrated nature of our customer base and their purchasing behavior our quarterly revenue and results of operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and are difficult to estimate For example any cancellation of orders or any acceleration or delay in anticipated product purchases or the acceptance of shipped products by our larger end customers could materially affect our revenue and results of operations in any quarterly period We may be unable to sustain or increase our revenue from our large end customers or offset the discontinuation of concentrated purchases by our larger end customers with purchases by new or existing end customers We expect that such concentrated purchases will continue to contribute materially to our revenue for the foreseeable future and that our results of operations may fluctuate materially as a result of such larger end customers buying patterns In addition we may see consolidation of our customer base such as among Internet companies and cloud service providers which could result in loss of end customers The loss of such end customers or a significant delay or reduction in their purchases could materially harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects We face intense competition especially from larger wellestablished companies and we may lack sufficient financial or other resources to maintain or improve our competitive position The market for data center networking including the market for cloud networking is intensely competitive and we expect competition to increase in the future from established competitors and new market entrants This competition could result in increased pricing pressure reduced profit margins increased sales and marketing expenses and our failure to increase or the loss of market share any of which would likely seriously harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 16 The data center networking market has been historically dominated by Cisco Systems with competition also coming from other large network equipment and system vendors including Brocade Communications Systems which has entered into an agreement to be acquired by Broadcom DellEMC Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Juniper Networks Most of our competitors have made acquisitions andor have entered into or extended partnerships or other strategic relationships to offer more comprehensive product lines including cloud networking solutions For example in the last few years alone Dell acquired Force10 and EMC IBM acquired Blade Network Technology Hewlett Packard Enterprises purchased Aruba Juniper acquired Contrail Cisco acquired Insieme and Broadcom who intends to acquire Brocade We also face competition from other companies and new market entrants including white box switch vendors as well as current technology partners and end customers who may develop network switches and cloud service solutions for internal use andor to broaden their portfolio of products Many of our existing and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages such as  greater name recognition and longer operating histories  larger sales and marketing budgets and resources  broader distribution and established relationships with channel partners and end customers  greater access to larger endcustomer bases  greater endcustomer support resources  greater manufacturing resources  the ability to leverage their sales efforts across a broader portfolio of products  the ability to leverage purchasing power with vendor subcomponents  the ability to bundle competitive offerings with other products and services  the ability to develop their own silicon chips  the ability to set more aggressive pricing policies  lower labor and development costs  greater resources to make acquisitions  larger intellectual property portfolios and  substantially greater financial technical research and development or other resources Our competitors also may be able to provide end customers with capabilities or benefits different from or greater than those we can provide in areas such as technical qualifications or geographic presence or may be able to provide end customers a broader range of products services and prices In addition large competitors may have more extensive relationships with and within existing and potential end customers that provide them with an advantage in competing for business with those end customers For example certain large competitors encourage end customers of their other products and services to adopt their data networking solutions through discounted bundled product packages Our ability to compete will depend upon our ability to provide a better solution than our competitors at a more competitive price We may be required to make substantial additional investments in research development marketing and sales in order to respond to competition and we cannot assure you that these investments will achieve any returns for us or that we will be able to compete successfully in the future We also expect increased competition if our market continues to expand Conditions in our market could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements or other factors Current or potential competitors may be acquired by third parties that have greater resources available than we do Our current or potential competitors might take advantage of the greater resources of the larger organization resulting from these acquisitions to compete more vigorously or broadly with us In addition continued industry consolidation might adversely affect end customers perceptions of the viability of smaller and even mediumsized networking companies and consequently end customers willingness to purchase from those companies Further certain large end customers may develop network switches and cloud service solutions for internal use andor to broaden their portfolio of products which could allow these end customers to become new competitors in the market 17 We are currently involved in litigation with Cisco Systems Inc We are currently involved in several litigation matters with Cisco Systems Inc These matters are summarized below Cisco Systems Inc v Arista Networks Inc Case No 414cv05343 43 Case On December 5 2014 Cisco filed a complaint against us in the District Court for the Northern District of California alleging that we infringe US Patent Nos 6377577 6741592 7023853 7061875 7162537 7200145 7224668 7290164 7340597 7460492 8051211 and 8356296

denying the patent and copyright infringement allegations and raising numerous affirmative defenses On March 6 2015 Cisco filed an amended complaint against us in the 44 Case In response we moved to dismiss Ciscos allegations of willful patent infringement and presuit indirect patent infringement The Court granted the motion with leave to amend on July 2 2015 On July 23 2015 Cisco filed an amended complaint As described below on May 25 2016 our petition for Inter Partes Review IPR of the 886 patent was instituted by the United States Patent Trial and Appeal Board PTAB Cisco subsequently agreed to dismiss its claims as to the 886 patent with prejudice Summary judgment crossmotions in the 44 Case were heard on August 4 2016 and the Court denied all motions brought by both sides Trial began on November 28 2016 and the jury rendered its verdict on December 14 2016 The jury found that we had proven our copyright defense of scenes a faire and that Cisco had failed to prove infringement of the 526 patent and on that basis judgment was entered in Aristas favor on all claims on December 19 2016 On January 17 2017 Cisco filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law challenging the sufficiency of the evidence in support of our scenes a faire defense Cisco did not file any posttrial motion regarding the 526 patent nor did it file a motion for a new trial We also filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law on several issues The hearing on both parties motions is currently set for April 27 2017 Arista Networks Inc v Cisco Systems Inc Case No 516cv00923 23 Case On February 24 2016 we filed a complaint against Cisco in the District Court for the Northern District of California alleging antitrust violations and unfair competition On April 13 2016 Cisco filed a motion to stay the 23 Case or in the alternative to dismiss the complaint On August 23 2016 the Court granted Ciscos motion to stay the 23 Case until judgment has been entered on Ciscos copyright claims in the 44 Case which the Court anticipated by December 22 2016 Following the jurys verdict in Aristas favor in the 44 Case the parties filed a stipulation continuing the Case Management Conference until March 2 2017 Trial in the 23 Case is set for August 3 2018 and is not affected by the Courts granting of the interim stay Certain Network Devices Related Software and Components Thereof Inv No 337TA944 944 Investigation On December 19 2014 Cisco filed a complaint against us in the USITC alleging that Arista has violated Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 as amended The USITC instituted Ciscos complaint as Investigation No 337TA944 Cisco initially alleged that certain Arista switching products infringe the 592 537 145 164 597 and 296 patents Cisco subsequently dropped the 296 patent from the 944 Investigation Cisco sought among other things a limited exclusion order barring entry into the United States of accused switch products including Aristas 7000 Series of switches and components and software therein and a cease and desist order against us restricting our activities with respect to our imported accused switch products and components and software therein On February 11 2015 we responded to the complaint in the 944 Investigation by among other things denying the patent infringement allegations and raising numerous affirmative defenses The Administrative Law Judge ALJ assigned to the 944 Investigation issued a procedural schedule calling for among other events an evidentiary hearing on September 911 and 1517 2015 issuance of an initial determination regarding our alleged violations on January 27 2016 and a Target Date for completion of the investigation on May 27 2016 On January 27 2016 the ALJ issued a

asserted claims 6 7 20 and 21 of the 592 patent and asserted claims 5 7 45 and 46 of the 145 patent The ALJ did not find a violation of section 337 with respect to any asserted claims of the 597 and 164 patents On April 11 2016 the Commission decided to review certain findings contained in the initial determination On June 23 2016 the Commission issued its Final Determination which found a violation with respect to the 537 592 and 145 patents and found no violation with respect to the 597 and 164 patents The Commission also issued a limited exclusion order and a cease and desist order pertaining to network devices related software and components thereof that infringe one or more of claims 1 2 811 and 1719 of the 537 patent claims 6 7 20 and 21 of the 592 patent and claims 5 7 45 and 46 of the 145 patent On August 22 2016 the Presidential review period for the 944 investigation expired The USITC orders will be in effect until the expiration of the 537 592 and 145 patents Both we and Cisco filed petitions for review of the USITCs Final Determination to the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit Federal Circuit On August 26 2016 the Federal Circuit consolidated the appeals and on September 23 2016 it issued an order setting an expedited briefing schedule The appeal is fully briefed and oral argument has not been scheduled On August 26 2016 Cisco filed an enforcement complaint under Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 as amended with the USITC Cisco alleges that we are violating the cease and desist and limited exclusion orders issued in the 944 Investigation by engaging in the marketing distribution offering for sale selling advertising andor aiding or abetting other entities in the sale andor distribution of products that Cisco alleges continue to infringe claims 12 811 and 1719 of the 537 patent despite the design changes we have made to those products Cisco asks the USTIC to 1 enforce the cease and desist order 2 modify the Commissions limited exclusion order andor cease and desist order in any manner that would assist in the prevention of the unfair practices that were originally the basis for issuing such Order or assist in the detection of violations of such Order 3 impose the maximum statutory civil penalties for violation of the cease and desist order including monetary sanctions for each days violation of the cease and desist order of the greater of 10000000 or twice the domestic value of the articles entered or sold whichever is higher 4 bring a civil action in US district court requesting collection of such civil penalties and the issuance of a mandatory injunction preventing further violation of Cease and Desist Order and 5 impose such other remedies and sanctions as are appropriate and within the Commissions authority On September 28 2016 the Commission instituted the enforcement proceeding The proceeding has been assigned to Administrative Law Judge Shaw who presided over the underlying investigation On October 14 2016 we responded to the complaint by among other things denying the patent infringement allegations and raising affirmative defenses On November 2 2016 the ALJ issued an order setting the deadline for the initial determination for June 20 2017 and the Target Date for September 20 2017 On November 3 2016 the ALJ issued a scheduling order setting the evidentiary hearing

set the deadline for determining whether to review the final initial determination to February 15 2017 On January 19 27 2017 the Commission further extended the Target Date to May 1 2017 and set the deadline for determining whether to review the final initial determination to March 1 2017 If the Commission finds a violation in its Final Determination that finding will be subject to a 60day Presidential review period Inter Partes Reviews We have filed petitions for Inter Partes Review IPR of the 597 211 668 853 537 577 886 and 526 patents IPRs relating to the 597 IPR No 201500978 and 211 IPR No 201500975 patents were instituted in October 2015 and hearings on these IPRs were completed in July 2016 On September 28 2016 the PTAB issued a final written decision finding claims 1 14 3942 71 72 84 and 85 of the 597 patent unpatentable The PTAB also found that claims 29 63 64 73 and 86 of the 597 patent had not been shown to be unpatentable Cisco requested rehearing of the PTABs Final Written Decision on October 28 2016 which the PTAB denied on January 13 2017 On January 23 2017 we filed a notice of appeal with respect to this decision regarding claims 29 63 64 73 and 86 of the 597 patent On October 5 2016 the PTAB issued a final written decision finding claims 1 and 12 of the 211 patent unpatentable The PTAB also found that claims 2 69 13 1720 of the 211 patent had not been shown to be unpatentable On December 5 2016 we filed a notice of appeal with respect to this decision regarding claims 2 69 13 1720 which was docketed as Appeal No 171313 Cisco filed a notice of crossappeal with respect to claims 1 and 12 on December 19 2016 which was docketed as Appeal No 171380 The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit consolidated these appeals on December 20 2016 The briefing is set to be completed in July 2017 The IPR relating to the 886 patent was instituted on May 25 2016 Following that decision Cisco agreed to dismiss its claims as to the 886 patent with prejudice and we dismissed our counterclaims as to the 886 patent without prejudice IPRs relating to the 668 IPR No 201600309 577 IPR No 201600303 853 IPR No 20160306 and 537 IPR No 20160308 patents were instituted in June 2016 and are set for hearing in March 2017 Final Written Decisions on these IPRs will be issued by June 2017      We intend to vigorously defend against each of the Ciscos lawsuits as summarized in the preceding paragraphs However we cannot be certain that any claims by Cisco would be resolved in our favor regardless of the merit of the claims Any adverse litigation ruling could result in the above described injunctive relief could require a significant damages award against us or a requirement that we make substantial royalty payments to Cisco andor could require that we modify our products to the extent that we are found to infringe any valid claims asserted against us by Cisco For example in the 944 Investigation the USITC has issued a limited exclusion order barring entry into the United States of our network devices including our 7000 Series of switches related software and components thereof that infringe one or more of the claims of the 537 592 and 145 patents specified above and a cease and desist order restricting our activities with respect to such imported products In addition in the 945 Investigation the ALJ has issued her initial determination finding a violation of section 337 of the Tariff Act with respect to the 668 and 577 patents which is now subject to review by the Commission To comply with these orders we have sought to develop technical designarounds that no longer infringe the patents that are the subject of the orders In any efforts to develop technical designarounds for our products we may be unable to do so in a manner that does not continue to infringe the patents or that is acceptable to our customers These development efforts could be extremely costly and time consuming as well as disruptive to our other development activities and distracting to management Moreover in the 944 Investigation and 945 Investigation such designarounds would require us to obtain approval of either the USITC or US Customs and Border Protection CBP to resume the importation of the redesigned products into the United States We may not be successful in our efforts to obtain such approvals to import such modified products in a timely manner or at all While a favorable ruling from the CBP would allow us to resume importation of our redesigned products into the United States the USITC could still determine in an enforcement action that our redesigned products continue to infringe the patents that are the subject of any USITC orders Any failure to effectively redesign our products to obtain timely clearance from USITC or CBP to import such redesigned products or to address the USITC findings in a manner that complies with the USITC orders may cause a disruption to our product shipments and materially and adversely affect our business prospects reputation results of operations and financial condition Specifically in response to the USITCs findings in the 944 Investigation we have made design changes to our products for sale in the United States to address the features that were found to infringe the 537 592 145 patents Following the issuance of the final determination in the 944 Investigation we submitted a Section 177 ruling request to CBP seeking approval to import these redesigned products into the United States On November 18 2016 we received a 177 ruling from CBP finding that our redesigned products did not infringe the 537 592 and 145 patents and approving the importation of these redesigned products into the United States However on January 13 2017 at the request of Cisco Systems and without our input CBP issued a letter to us revoking its prior November 18 ruling Due to this revocation Arista can no longer import its products into the United States The CBP has informed us that it currently takes no position on whether Aristas redesigned products infringe and will conduct an inter partes proceeding between Arista and Cisco to determine whether Aristas redesigned products infringe and whether to approve them for importation into the United States We do 20 not yet know when CBP will complete the process and provide that ruling The CBP may not rule in a timely fashion and we may not receive a favorable ruling at the end of the process Similarly if the USITC finds in a Final Determination that we infringe any patent in the 945 Investigation the USITC will likely issue remedial orders in that investigation as well If such orders are not disapproved by the United States Trade Representative we would need to further modify our products to take our products outside the scope of any patents we are found to have infringed in the 945 Investigation and obtain the USITC andor CBP approvals described above in order to resume importation of our redesigned products into the United States If the USITC determines that our redesigned products continue to infringe the patents subject to any USITC limited exclusion order or cease and desist order in an enforcement action for either the 944 Investigation or the 945 Investigation the USITC may impose the maximum statutory civil penalties for violation of the cease and desist order including monetary sanctions for each days violation of the cease and desist order of the greater of 10000000 or twice the domestic value of the articles entered or sold whichever is higher bring a civil action in US district court requesting collection of such civil penalties and the issuance of a mandatory injunction preventing further violation of Cease and Desist Order or impose such other remedies and sanctions as are appropriate and within the Commissions authority In order to comply with the USITCs remedial orders we have also made certain changes to our manufacturing importation and shipping workflows These changes have included shifting manufacturing and integration of our products to be sold in the United States to US facilities Such changes may be extremely costly time consuming and we may not be able to implement such changes successfully Any failure to successfully change our manufacturing and importation processes or shipping workflows in a manner that is compliant with the limited exclusion order and cease and desist order may cause a disruption in our product shipments and materially and adversely affect our business prospects reputation results of operations and financial condition In connection with these changes to the extent that we are required to make further modifications to our supply chain to obtain alternative US sources for subcomponents we may be unable to obtain a sufficient quantity of these components on commercially reasonable terms or in a timely manner if at all which could delay or halt entirely production of our products or require us to make further modifications to our products to incorporate new components that are available in the United States Any of these events could result in lost sales reduced gross margins or damage to our endcustomer relationships which would materially and adversely impact our business financial condition results of operations and prospects Additionally the existence of Ciscos lawsuits against us could cause concern among our customers and partners and could adversely affect our business and results of operations Many of our customers and partners require us to indemnify and defend them against third party infringement claims and pay damages in the case of adverse rulings These claims could harm our relationships with our customers or channel partners cause them to delay or defer purchasing decisions or deter them from doing business with us From time to time we may also be required to provide additional assurances beyond our standard terms Whether or not we prevail in the lawsuit we expect that the litigation will be expensive timeconsuming and a distraction to management in operating our business We are currently involved in a license dispute with OptumSoft Inc On April 4 2014 OptumSoft filed a lawsuit against us in the Superior Court of California Santa Clara County titled OptumSoft Inc v Arista Networks Inc  in which it asserts i ownership of certain components of our EOS network operating system pursuant to the terms of a 2004 agreement between the companies and ii breaches of certain confidentiality and use restrictions in that agreement Under the terms of the 2004 agreement OptumSoft provided us with a nonexclusive irrevocable royaltyfree license to software delivered by OptumSoft comprising a software tool used to develop certain components of EOS and a runtime library that is incorporated into EOS The 2004 agreement places certain restrictions on our use and disclosure of the OptumSoft software and gives OptumSoft ownership of improvements modifications and corrections to and derivative works of the OptumSoft software that we develop In its lawsuit OptumSoft has asked the Court to order us to i give OptumSoft access to our software for evaluation by OptumSoft ii cease all conduct constituting the alleged confidentiality and use restriction breaches iii secure the return or deletion of OptumSofts alleged intellectual property provided to third parties including our customers iv assign ownership to OptumSoft of OptumSofts alleged intellectual property currently owned by us and v pay OptumSofts alleged damages attorneys fees and costs of the lawsuit David Cheriton one of our founders and a former member of our board of directors who resigned from our board of directors on March 1 2014 and has no continuing role with us is a founder and we believe the largest stockholder and director of OptumSoft The 2010 David R Cheriton Irrevocable Trust dtd July 28 2010 a trust for the benefit of the minor children of Mr Cheriton is one of our largest stockholders On April 14 2014 we filed a crosscomplaint against OptumSoft in which we assert our ownership of the software components at issue and our interpretation of the 2004 agreement Among other things we assert that the language of the 2004 agreement and the parties long course of conduct support our ownership of the disputed software components We ask the Court to declare our ownership of those software components all similarlysituated software components developed in the future and all related intellectual property We also assert that even if we are found not to own certain components such components are licensed to us under the terms of the 2004 agreement However there can be no assurance that our assertions will ultimately prevail in litigation On the same day we also filed an answer to OptumSofts claims as well as affirmative defenses based in part on OptumSofts failure to maintain the confidentiality of 21 its claimed trade secrets its authorization of the disclosures it asserts and its delay in claiming ownership of the software components at issue We have also taken additional steps to respond to OptumSofts allegations that we improperly used andor disclosed OptumSoft confidential information While we believe we have meritorious defenses to these allegations we believe we have i revised our software to remove the elements we understand to be the subject of the claims relating to improper use and disclosure of OptumSoft confidential information and made the revised software available to our customers and ii removed information from our website that OptumSoft asserted disclosed OptumSoft confidential information The parties tried Phase I of the case relating to contract interpretation and application of the contract to certain claimed source code in September 2015 On December 16 2015 the Court issued a Proposed Statement of Decision Following Phase 1 Trial and on January 8 2016 OptumSoft filed objections to that Proposed Statement of Decision On March 23 2016 the Court issued a Final Statement of Decision Following Phase I Trial in which it agreed with and adopted our interpretation of the 2004 agreement and held that we and not OptumSoft own all the software at issue in Phase I The remaining issues that were not addressed in the Phase I trial are set to be tried in Phase II including the application of the Courts interpretation of the 2004 agreement as set forth in the Final Statement of Decision Following Phase I Trial to any other source code that OptumSoft claims to own following a review Phase II was previously scheduled to be tried in April 2016 however that trial date has been vacated and a new trial date has not yet been set We intend to vigorously defend against any claims brought against us by OptumSoft However we cannot be certain that if litigated any claims by OptumSoft would be resolved in our favor For example if it were determined that OptumSoft owned components of our EOS network operating system we would be required to transfer ownership of those components and any related intellectual property to OptumSoft If OptumSoft were the owner of those components it could make them available to our competitors such as through a sale or license An adverse litigation ruling could result in a significant damages award against us and injunctive relief In addition OptumSoft could assert additional or different claims against us including claims that our license from OptumSoft is invalid Our revenue growth rate in recent periods may not be indicative of our future performance Our revenue growth rate in recent periods may not be indicative of our future performance We experienced annual revenue growth rates of 348  434 and 617 in 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively We may not achieve similar revenue growth rates in future periods especially as we enter and expand into the cloud services and application services provider markets You should not rely on our revenue for any prior quarterly or annual period as any indication of our future revenue or revenue growth If we are unable to maintain consistent revenue or revenue growth our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected Some of our large end customers require more favorable terms and conditions from their vendors and may request price concessions As we seek to sell more products to these end customers we may be required to agree to terms and conditions that may have an adverse effect on our business or ability to recognize revenue Our large end customers have significant purchasing power and as a result may receive more favorable terms and conditions than we typically provide to other end customers including lower prices bundled upgrades extended warranties acceptance terms indemnification terms and extended return policies and other contractual rights As we seek to sell more products to these large end customers an increased mix of our shipments may be subject to such terms and conditions which may reduce our margins or affect the timing of our revenue recognition and thus may have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects If we do not successfully anticipate technological shifts market needs and opportunities and develop products and product enhancements that meet those technological shifts needs and opportunities or if those products are not made available in a timely manner or do not gain market acceptance we may not be able to compete effectively and our ability to generate revenue will suffer The cloud networking market can be characterized by rapid technological shifts and increasingly complex endcustomer requirements to achieve scalable and more programmable networks that facilitate virtualization big data publicprivate cloud and web scale computing We must continue to develop new technologies and products that address emerging technological trends and changing endcustomer needs The process of developing new technology is complex and uncertain and new offerings requires significant upfront investment that may not result in material design improvements to existing products or result in marketable new products or costs savings or revenue for an extended period of time if at all The success of new products depends on several factors including appropriate new product definition component costs timely completion and introduction of these products differentiation of new products from those of our competitors and market acceptance of these products In addition new technologies could render our existing products obsolete or less attractive to end customers and our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected if such technologies are widely adopted For example end customers may prefer to address their network switch requirements by licensing software operating systems separately and placing them on industrystandard servers or develop their own networking products rather than purchasing integrated hardware products as has occurred in the server industry We may not be able to successfully anticipate or adapt to changing technology or endcustomer requirements on a timely basis or at all If we fail to keep up with technology changes or to convince our end customers and potential end customers of the value of our 22 solutions even in light of new technologies our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected Product quality problems defects errors or vulnerabilities in our products or services could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects We produce highly complex products that incorporate advanced technologies including both hardware and software technologies Despite testing prior to their release our products may contain undetected defects or errors especially when first introduced or when new versions are released Product defects or errors could affect the performance of our products and could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products Allegations of unsatisfactory performance could cause us to lose revenue or market share increase our service costs cause us to incur substantial costs in analyzing correcting or redesigning the products cause us to lose significant end customers subject us to liability for damages and divert our resources from other tasks any one of which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects From time to time we have had to replace certain components of products that we had shipped and provide remediation in response to the discovery of defects or bugs including failures in software protocols or defective component batches resulting in reliability issues in such products and we may be required to do so in the future We may also be required to provide full replacements or refunds for such defective products We cannot assure you that such remediation would not have a material effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects Please see Our business is subject to the risks of warranty claims product returns product liability and product defects Managing the supply of our products and product components is complex Insufficient supply and inventory may result in lost sales opportunities or delayed revenue while excess inventory may harm our gross margins Managing the supply of our products and product components is complex and our inventory management systems and related supplychain visibility tools may not enable us to forecast accurately and manage effectively the supply of our products and product components Furthermore ongoing Cisco litigation before the USITC and any adverse ruling that results from such litigation could cause disruption to our supplychain or with our suppliers which may impact our revenues business and reputation For example in the 944 Investigation the USITC has issued a limited exclusion order barring entry into the United States of our network devices including our 7000 Series of switches related software and components thereof that infringe one or more of the claims of the 537 592 and 145 patents specified above and a Cease and Desist Order restricting our activities with respect to such imported products which could prevent us from using inventory to satisfy US demand and may cause us to writedown such inventory which could reduce our gross margins To the extent that we are required to obtain alternative US sources for these components we may be unable to obtain a sufficient quantity of these components on commercially reasonable terms or in a timely manner if at all sales of our products could be delayed or halted entirely or we may be required to redesign our products Any of these events could result in lost sales reduced gross margins or damage to our endcustomer relationships which would materially and adversely impact our business financial condition results of operations and prospects Insufficient supply and inventory may result in increased lead times for our products lost sales opportunities or delayed revenue while excess inventory may harm our gross margins In order to reduce manufacturing lead times and plan for adequate component supply from time to time we may issue purchase orders for components and products that are noncancelable and nonreturnable We establish a liability for noncancelable nonreturnable purchase commitments with our component inventory suppliers for quantities in excess of our demand forecasts or for products that are considered obsolete In addition we establish a liability and reimburse our contract manufacturer for component inventory purchased on our behalf that has been rendered excess or obsolete due to manufacturing and engineering change orders or in cases where inventory levels greatly exceed our demand forecasts Supply management remains an increased area of focus as we balance the need to maintain sufficient supply levels to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of obsolescence or the end of life of certain products If we ultimately determine that we have excess supply we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory which in turn could result in lower gross margins We record a provision when inventory is determined to be in excess of anticipated demand or obsolete to adjust inventory to its estimated realizable value Alternatively insufficient supply levels may lead to shortages that result in delayed revenue or loss of sales opportunities altogether as potential end customers turn to competitors products that are readily available Additionally any increases in the time required to manufacture our products or ship products could result in supply shortfalls If we are unable to effectively manage our supply and inventory our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected 23 Because some of the key components in our products come from sole limited sources of supply we are susceptible to supply shortages or supply changes which could disrupt or delay our scheduled product deliveries to our end customers and may result in the loss of sales and end customers Our products rely on key components including integrated circuit components and power supplies that our contract manufacturers purchase on our behalf from a limited number of suppliers including certain sole source providers We do not have guaranteed supply contracts with any of our component suppliers and our suppliers could delay shipments or cease manufacturing such products or selling them to us at any time For example in the past we have experienced shortages in inventory for dynamic random access memory integrated circuits and delayed releases of the next generation of chipset which delayed our production andor the release of our new products The development of alternate sources for those components is timeconsuming difficult and costly Additionally in the 944 Investigation the USITC has issued a Limited Exclusion Order barring entry into the United States of our network devices including our 7000 Series of switches related software and components thereof that infringe one or more of the claims of the 537 592 and 145 patents specified above and a Cease and Desist Order restricting our activities with respect to such imported products If we are unable to obtain a sufficient quantity of these components on commercially reasonable terms or in a timely manner or if we are unable to obtain alternative sources for these components sales of our products could be delayed or halted entirely or we may be required to redesign our products Any of these events could result in lost sales reduced gross margins or damage to our endcustomer relationships which would adversely impact our business financial condition results of operations and prospects Our reliance on component suppliers also yields the potential for their infringement or misappropriation of third party intellectual property rights with respect to components which may be incorporated into our products We may not be indemnified by such component suppliers for such infringement or misappropriation claims Any litigation for which we do not receive indemnification could require us to incur significant legal expenses in defending against such claims or require us to pay substantial royalty payments or settlement amounts that would not be reimbursed by our component suppliers Our product development efforts are also dependent upon our continued collaboration with our key merchant silicon vendors such as Broadcom and Intel As we develop our product roadmap and continue to expand our relationships with these and other merchant silicon vendors it is critical that we work in tandem with our key merchant silicon vendors to ensure that their silicon includes improved features and that our products take advantage of such improved features This enables us to focus our research and development resources on our software core competencies and to leverage the investments made by merchant silicon vendors to achieve costeffective solutions If our key merchant silicon vendors do not continue to collaborate in such a fashion if they do not continue to innovate or if there are delays in the release of their products our own product launches could be delayed which could have a material effect on revenue and business financial condition results of operations and prospects In the event of a shortage or supply interruption from our component suppliers we may not be able to develop alternate or second sources in a timely manner Further longterm supply and maintenance obligations to end customers increase the duration for which specific components are required which may increase the risk of component shortages or the cost of carrying inventory In addition our component suppliers change their selling prices frequently in response to market trends including industrywide increases in demand and because we do not have contracts with these suppliers we are susceptible to price fluctuations related to raw materials and components If we are unable to pass component price increases along to our end customers or maintain stable pricing our gross margins could be adversely affected and our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could suffer Because we depend on thirdparty manufacturers to build our products we are susceptible to manufacturing delays and pricing fluctuations that could prevent us from shipping endcustomer orders on time if at all or on a costeffective basis which may result in the loss of sales and end customers We depend on thirdparty contract manufacturers to manufacture our product lines A significant portion of our cost of revenue consists of payments to these thirdparty contract manufacturers Our reliance on these thirdparty contract manufacturers reduces our control over the manufacturing process quality assurance product costs and product supply and timing which exposes us to risk To the extent that our products are manufactured at facilities in foreign countries we may be subject to additional risks associated with complying with local rules and regulations in those jurisdictions Our reliance on contract manufacturers also yields the potential for their infringement of third party intellectual property rights in the manufacturing of our products or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights in the manufacturing of other customers products If we are unable to manage our relationships with our thirdparty contract manufacturers effectively or if these thirdparty manufacturers suffer delays or disruptions or quality control problems in their operations experience increased manufacturing lead times capacity constraints or quality control problems in their manufacturing operations or fail to meet our future requirements for timely delivery our ability to ship products to our end customers would be severely impaired and our business financial condition results of operations and prospects would be seriously harmed Our contract manufacturers typically fulfill our supply requirements on the basis of individual orders We do not have longterm contracts with our thirdparty manufacturers that guarantee capacity the continuation of particular pricing terms or the extension of credit limits Accordingly they are not obligated to continue to fulfill our supply requirements which could result in supply shortages and the prices we are charged for manufacturing services could be increased on short notice For example a competitor could place large orders with the thirdparty manufacturer thereby utilizing all or substantially all of such thirdparty manufacturers capacity and leaving the manufacturer little or no capacity to fulfill our individual orders without price increases or delays or at all Our contract with one of our 24 contract manufacturers permits it to terminate the agreement for convenience subject to prior notice requirements We may not be able to develop alternate or second contract manufacturers in a timely manner If we add or change contract manufacturers or change any manufacturing plant locations within a contract manufacturer network we would add additional complexity and risk to our supply chain management and may increase our working capital requirements Ensuring a new contract manufacturer or new plant location is qualified to manufacture our products to our standards and industry requirements could take significant effort and be time consuming and expensive For example we have added Sanmina as an additional contract manufacturer Any such addition or change in manufacturers may be extremely costly time consuming and we may not be able to do so successfully In addition we may be subject to additional significant challenges in ensuring that quality processes and costs among other issues are consistent with our expectations and those of our customers A new contract manufacturer or manufacturing location may not be able to scale its production of our products at the volumes or quality we require This could also adversely affect our ability to meet our scheduled product deliveries to our end customers which could damage our customer relationships and cause the loss of sales to existing or potential end customers late delivery penalties delayed revenue or an increase in our costs which could adversely affect our gross margins This could also result in increased levels of inventory subjecting us to increased excess and obsolete charges that could have a negative impact on our operating results We have expanded our contract manufacturing capabilities to include Sanmina as an additional contract manufacturer which will increase our working capital requirements and the risks noted above apply to this new contract manufacturer No assurance can be given that this contract manufacturer will continue to successfully qualify and scale production of our products in the volumes or quality that we require If a USITC Limited Exclusion Order issued in connection with the Cisco litigation bars entry of our products into the United States and we are unable to obtain CPB approval to resume the importation of our redesigned products we would become reliant upon US manufacturing to continue to supply our products to our US customers Any failure to meet our scheduled product deliveries to our end customers could damage our customer relationships and cause the loss of sales to existing or potential end customers late delivery penalties delayed revenue or an increase in our costs which could adversely affect our gross margins Any production interruptions or disruptions for any reason including those noted above as well as a natural disaster epidemic capacity shortages adverse results from intellectual property litigation or quality problems at one of our manufacturing partners would adversely affect sales of our product lines manufactured by that manufacturing partner and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects If we are unable to attract new large end customers or to sell additional products to our existing end customers our revenue growth will be adversely affected and our revenue could decrease To increase our revenue we must add new end customers and large end customers and sell additional products to existing end customers For example one of our sales strategies is to target specific projects at our current end customers because they are familiar with the operational and economic benefits of our solutions thereby reducing the sales cycle into these customers We believe this opportunity with current end customers to be significant given their existing infrastructure and expected future spend If we fail to attract new large end customers or fail to reduce the sales cycle and sell additional products to our existing end customers our business financial condition results of operations and prospects will be harmed Reliance on shipments at the end of the quarter could cause our revenue for the applicable period to fall below expected levels We may be subject to supply chain delays or endcustomer buying patterns in which a substantial portion of sales orders and shipments may occur in the second half of each quarter This places significant pressure on order review and processing supply chain management manufacturing inventory and quality control management shipping and trade compliance to ensure that we have properly forecasted supply purchasing manufacturing capacity inventory and quality compliance and logistics If there is any significant interruption in these critical functions it could result in delayed order fulfillment adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects and result in a decline in the market price of our common stock We base our inventory requirements on our forecasts of future sales If these forecasts are materially inaccurate we may procure inventory that we may be unable to use in a timely manner or at all We and our contract manufacturers procure components and build our products based on our forecasts These forecasts are based on estimates of future demand for our products which are in turn based on historical trends and analyses from our sales and marketing organizations adjusted for overall market conditions and other factors To the extent our forecasts are materially inaccurate or if we otherwise do not need such inventory we may under or overprocure inventory and such inaccuracies in our forecasts could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations The sales prices of our products and services may decrease which may reduce our gross profits and adversely affect our results of operations The sales prices for our products and services may decline for a variety of reasons including competitive pricing pressures discounts a change in our mix of products and services the introduction of new products and services by us or by our competitors promotional programs product and related warranty costs or broader macroeconomic factors In addition we have provided and may 25 in the future provide pricing discounts to large end customers which may result in lower margins for the period in which such sales occur Our gross margins may also fluctuate as a result of the timing of such sales to large end customers We have experienced declines in sales prices for our products Competition continues to increase in the market segments in which we participate and we expect competition to further increase in the future thereby leading to increased pricing pressures Larger competitors with more diverse product and service offerings may reduce the price of products and services that compete with ours or may bundle them with other products and services Additionally although we generally price our products worldwide in US dollars currency fluctuations in certain countries and regions may adversely affect actual prices that partners and end customers are willing to pay in those countries and regions Furthermore we anticipate that the sales prices and gross profits for our products will decrease over product life cycles Decreased sales prices for any reason may reduce our gross profits and adversely affect our result of operations Seasonality may cause fluctuations in our revenue and results of operations We operate on a December 31st year end and believe that there are significant seasonal factors which may cause sequential product revenue growth to be greater for the second and fourth quarters of our year than our first and third quarters We believe that this seasonality results from a number of factors including the procurement budgeting and deployment cycles of many of our end customers Our rapid historical growth may have reduced the impact of seasonal or cyclical factors that might have influenced our business to date As our increasing size causes our growth rate to slow seasonal or cyclical variations in our operations may become more pronounced over time and may materially affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects The cloud networking market is still in its early stages and is rapidly evolving If this market does not evolve as we anticipate or our target end customers do not adopt our cloud networking solutions we may not be able to compete effectively and our ability to generate revenue will suffer The cloud networking market is still in its early stages The market demand for cloud networking solutions has increased in recent years as end customers have deployed larger networks and have increased the use of virtualization and cloud computing Our success depends upon our ability to provide cloud networking solutions that address the needs of end customers more effectively and economically than those of other competitors or existing technologies If the cloud networking solutions market does not develop in the way we anticipate if our solutions do not offer benefits compared to competing network switching products or if end customers do not recognize the benefits that our solutions provide then our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected If we are unable to increase market awareness of our company and our products our revenue may not continue to grow or may decline We have not yet established broad market awareness of our products and services Market awareness of our value proposition and products and services will be essential to our continued growth and our success particularly for the service provider and large enterprise markets If our marketing efforts are unsuccessful in creating market awareness of our company and our products and services then our business financial condition results of operations and prospects will be adversely affected and we will not be able to achieve sustained growth The requirements of being a public company may strain our resources divert managements attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members As a public company we are subject to the reporting and corporate governance requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended or the Exchange Act the listing requirements of the New York Stock Exchange and other applicable securities rules and regulations including the SarbanesOxley Act of 2002 or the SarbanesOxley Act and the DoddFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 or the DoddFrank Act Compliance with these rules and regulations and the attendant responsibilities of management and the board may make it more difficult to attract and retain executive officers and members of our board of directors particularly to serve on our Audit Committee and Compensation Committee has increased our legal and financial compliance costs made some activities more difficult timeconsuming or costly and increased demand on our systems and resources Among other things the Exchange Act requires that we file annual quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and results of operations and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting In order to maintain and if required improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet this standard significant resources and management oversight may be required In addition if our internal control over financial reporting is not effective as defined under Section 404 we could be subject to one or more investigations or enforcement actions by state or federal regulatory agencies stockholder lawsuits or other adverse actions requiring us to incur defense costs pay fines settlements or judgments As a result managements attention may be diverted from other business concerns which could harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects Although we have already hired additional employees to help comply with these requirements we may need to further expand our legal and finance departments in the future which will increase our costs and expenses In addition changing laws regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure such as continued rulemaking pursuant to the DoddFrank Act and related rules and regulations are creating uncertainty for public companies increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time consuming These laws regulations and standards are subject 26 to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity and as a result their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws regulations and standards and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expense and a diversion of managements time and attention from revenuegenerating activities to compliance activities If our efforts to comply with new laws regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business and prospects may be harmed As a result of disclosure of information in the filings required of a public company our business and financial condition will become more visible which may result in threatened or actual litigation including by competitors and other third parties If such claims are successful our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be harmed and even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor these claims and the time and resources necessary to resolve them could divert the resources of our management and harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects In addition as a result of our disclosure obligations as a public company we will have reduced strategic flexibility and will be under pressure to focus on shortterm results which may adversely affect our ability to achieve longterm profitability We also believe that being a public company and these new rules and regulations makes it more expensive for us to obtain and maintain director and officer liability insurance and in the future we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors particularly to serve on our Audit Committee and Compensation Committee and qualified executive officers If we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be adversely affected Assessing our processes procedures and staffing in order to improve our internal control over financial reporting is an ongoing process Preparing our financial statements involves a number of complex processes many of which are done manually and are dependent upon individual data input or review These processes include but are not limited to calculating revenue inventory costs and the preparation of our statement of cash flows While we continue to automate our processes and enhance our review controls to reduce the likelihood for errors we expect that for the foreseeable future many of our processes will remain manually intensive and thus subject to human error In the past we have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and we cannot give assurance that additional material weaknesses will not be identified in the future The existence of one or more material weaknesses could preclude a conclusion by management that we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting The existence or disclosure of any such material weakness could adversely affect our stock price If we are unable to hire retain train and motivate qualified personnel and senior management our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could suffer Our future success depends in part on our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled personnel particularly software engineering and sales personnel Competition for highly skilled personnel is often intense especially in the San Francisco Bay Area where we have a substantial presence and need for highly skilled personnel Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have to provide more attractive compensation packages and other amenities Research and development personnel are aggressively recruited by startup and growth companies which are especially active in many of the technical areas and geographic regions in which we conduct product development In addition in making employment decisions particularly in the hightechnology industry job candidates often consider the value of the stockbased compensation they are to receive in connection with their employment Declines in the market price of our stock could adversely affect our ability to attract motivate or retain key employees If we are unable to attract or retain qualified personnel or if there are delays in hiring required personnel our business financial condition results of operations and prospects may be seriously harmed Also to the extent we hire personnel from competitors we may be subject to allegations that such personnel has been improperly solicited that such personnel has divulged proprietary or other confidential information or that former employers own certain inventions or other work product Such claims could result in litigation Please see We may become involved in litigation that may materially adversely affect us Our future performance also depends on the continued services and continuing contributions of our senior management to execute our business plan and to identify and pursue new opportunities and product innovations Our employment arrangements with our employees do not require that they continue to work for us for any specified period and therefore they could terminate their employment with us at any time The loss of our key personnel including Jayshree Ullal our Chief Executive Officer Andy Bechtolsheim our Founder and Chief Development Officer and Kenneth Duda our Founder Chief Technology Officer and SVP Software Engineering or other members of our senior management team sales and marketing team or engineering team or any difficulty attracting or retaining other highly qualified personnel in the future could significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our development and strategic objectives which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 27 We are subject to a number of risks associated with the expansion of our international sales and operations Our ability to grow our business and our future success will depend to a significant extent on our ability to expand our operations and customer base worldwide We have a limited history of marketing selling and supporting our products and services internationally Operating in a global marketplace we are subject to risks associated with having an international reach and requirements such as compliance with applicable anticorruption laws One such applicable anticorruption law is the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or FCPA which generally prohibits US companies and its employees and intermediaries from making corrupt payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business securing an advantage and directing business to another and requires companies to maintain accurate books and records and a system of internal accounting controls Under the FCPA US companies may be held liable for the corrupt actions taken by directors officers employees agents or other strategic or local partners or representatives As such if we or our intermediaries fail to comply with the requirements of the FCPA or similar legislation governmental authorities in the US and elsewhere could seek to impose civil andor criminal fines and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial conditions Failure to comply with anticorruption and antibribery laws such as the FCPA and the United Kingdom Bribery Act of 2010 or the UK Bribery Act and similar laws associated with our activities outside the US could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences We intend to increase our international sales and business and as such the risk of violating laws such as the FCPA and UK Bribery Act increases Additionally as a result of our international reach we must hire and train experienced personnel to staff and manage our foreign operations To the extent that we experience difficulties in recruiting training managing and retaining an international staff and specifically staff related to sales management and sales personnel we may experience difficulties in sales productivity in foreign markets We also enter into strategic distributor and reseller relationships with companies in certain international markets where we do not have a local presence If we are not able to maintain successful strategic distributor relationships internationally or to recruit additional companies to enter into strategic distributor relationships our future success in these international markets could be limited Business practices in the international markets that we serve may differ from those in the US and may require us in the future to include terms other than our standard terms in endcustomer contracts although to date we generally have not done so To the extent that we may enter into endcustomer contracts in the future that include nonstandard terms related to payment warranties or performance obligations our results of operations may be adversely affected Additionally our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks including the following  greater difficulty in enforcing contracts and accounts receivable collection and longer collection periods  increased expenses incurred in establishing and maintaining our international operations  fluctuations in exchange rates between the US dollar and foreign currencies where we do business  greater difficulty and costs in recruiting local experienced personnel  wage inflation in certain growing economies  general economic and political conditions in these foreign markets  economic uncertainty around the world as a result of sovereign debt issues  communication and integration problems resulting from cultural and geographic dispersion  limitations on our ability to access cash resources in our international operations  ability to establish necessary business relationships and to comply with local business requirements  risks associated with trade restrictions and foreign legal requirements including the importation certification and localization of our products required in foreign countries  greater risk of unexpected changes in regulatory practices tariffs and tax laws and treaties  the uncertainty of protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  greater risk of a failure of foreign employees to comply with both US and foreign laws including antitrust regulations the FCPA and any trade regulations ensuring fair trade practices and  heightened risk of unfair or corrupt business practices in certain geographies and of improper or fraudulent sales arrangements that may impact financial results and result in restatements of or irregularities in financial statements These and other factors could harm our ability to gain future international revenue and consequently materially affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects Expanding our existing international operations and entering into additional international markets will require significant management attention and financial commitments Our failure to successfully manage our international operations and the associated risks effectively could limit our future growth or materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects Our ability to sell our products is highly dependent on the quality of our support and services offerings and our failure to offer highquality support and services could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects Once our products are deployed within our end customers networks our end customers depend on our support organization and our channel partners to resolve any issues relating to our products Highquality support is critical for the successful marketing and sale of our products If we or our channel partners do not assist our end customers in deploying our products effectively do not succeed 28 in helping our end customers resolve postdeployment issues quickly or do not provide adequate ongoing support it could adversely affect our ability to sell our products to existing end customers and could harm our reputation with potential end customers In addition as we expand our operations internationally our support organization will face additional challenges including those associated with delivering support training and documentation in languages other than English Our failure or the failure of our channel partners to maintain highquality support and services could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects Adverse economic conditions or reduced information technology and network infrastructure spending may adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects Our business depends on the overall demand for information technology network connectivity and access to data and applications Weak domestic or global economic conditions fear or anticipation of such conditions or a reduction in information technology and network infrastructure spending even if economic conditions improve could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects in a number of ways including longer sales cycles lower prices for our products and services higher default rates among our distributors reduced unit sales and lower or no growth For example the ongoing debt concerns in many countries in Europe have caused and are likely to continue to cause uncertainty and instability in local economies and in global financial markets particularly if any future sovereign debt defaults or significant bank failures or defaults occur Market uncertainty and instability in Europe could intensify or spread further particularly if ongoing stabilization efforts prove insufficient Concerns have been raised as to the financial political and legal ineffectiveness of measures taken to date Continuing or worsening economic instability in Europe and elsewhere could adversely affect spending for IT network infrastructure systems and tools Continued turmoil in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world may also affect the overall demand for our products Although we do not believe that our business financial condition results of operations and prospects have been significantly adversely affected by economic and political uncertainty in Europe and other countries deterioration of such conditions may harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects in the future A prolonged period of economic uncertainty or a downturn may also significantly affect financing markets the availability of capital and the terms and conditions of financing arrangements including the overall cost of financing as well as the financial health or creditworthiness of our end customers Circumstances may arise in which we need or desire to raise additional capital and such capital may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all We may become involved in litigation that may materially adversely affect us From time to time we may become involved in various legal proceedings relating to matters incidental to the ordinary course of our business including patent copyright commercial product liability employment class action whistleblower and other litigation and claims in addition to governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings Such matters can be timeconsuming divert managements attention and resources cause us to incur significant expenses or liability andor require us to change our business practices Because of the potential risks expenses and uncertainties of litigation we may from time to time settle disputes even where we have meritorious claims or defenses by agreeing to settlement agreements Because litigation is inherently unpredictable we cannot assure you that the results of any of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects For more information regarding the litigation in which we are currently involved see the Legal Proceedings subheading in in Note 5 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10K Assertions by third parties of infringement or other violations by us of their intellectual property rights or other lawsuits asserted against us could result in significant costs and substantially harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects Patent and other intellectual property disputes are common in the network infrastructure industry and have resulted in protracted and expensive litigation for many companies Many companies in the network infrastructure industry including our competitors and other third parties as well as nonpracticing entities own large numbers of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets which they may use to assert claims of patent infringement misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property rights against us From time to time they have or may in the future also assert such claims against us our end customers or channel partners whom we typically indemnify against claims that our products infringe misappropriate or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of third parties As the number of products and competitors in our market increases and overlaps occur claims of infringement misappropriation and other violations of intellectual property rights may increase Any claim of infringement misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property rights by a third party even those without merit could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim distract our management from our business and require us to cease use of such intellectual property In addition some claims for patent infringement may relate to subcomponents that we purchase from third parties If these third parties are unable or unwilling to indemnify us for these claims we could be substantially harmed The patent portfolios of most of our competitors are larger than ours This disparity may increase the risk that our competitors may sue us for patent infringement and may limit our ability to counterclaim for patent infringement or settle through patent crosslicenses In addition future assertions of patent rights by third parties and any resulting litigation may involve patent holding companies 29 or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant product revenue and against whom our own patents may therefore provide little or no deterrence or protection We cannot assure you that we are not infringing or otherwise violating any thirdparty intellectual property rights The thirdparty asserters of intellectual property claims may be unreasonable in their demands or may simply refuse to settle which could lead to expensive settlement payments prolonged periods of litigation and related expenses additional burdens on employees or other resources distraction from our business supply stoppages and lost sales An adverse outcome of a dispute including those lawsuits described under the Legal Proceedings subheading in Note 5 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10K may require us to pay substantial damages or penalties including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed a third partys patents cease making licensing or using solutions that are alleged to infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property of others expend additional development resources to attempt to redesign our products or services or otherwise to develop noninfringing technology which may not be successful enter into potentially unfavorable royalty or license agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies or intellectual property rights and indemnify our partners and other third parties Any damages penalties or royalty obligations we may become subject to as a result of an adverse outcome and any thirdparty indemnity we may need to provide could harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects Royalty or licensing agreements if required or desirable may be unavailable on terms acceptable to us or at all and may require significant royalty payments and other expenditures Further there is little or no information publicly available concerning market or fair values for license fees which can lead to overpayment of license or settlement fees In addition some licenses may be nonexclusive and therefore our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us Suppliers subject to thirdparty intellectual property claims also may choose or be forced to discontinue or alter their arrangements with us with little or no advance notice to us Any of these events could seriously harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects Our standard sales contracts contain indemnification provisions requiring us to defend our end customers against thirdparty claims including against infringement of certain intellectual property rights that could expose us to losses which could seriously harm our business financial conditions results of operations and prospects Under the indemnification provisions of our standard sales contracts we agree to defend our end customers and channel partners against thirdparty claims asserting infringement of certain intellectual property rights which may include patents copyrights trademarks or trade secrets and to pay judgments entered on such claims For example we are currently involved in ongoing Cisco litigation claims before the USITC An adverse ruling in such litigation may potentially expose us to claims in the event that claims are brought against our customers based on the ruling and we are required to indemnify such customers Our exposure under these indemnification provisions is frequently limited to the total amount paid by our end customer under the agreement However certain agreements include indemnification provisions that could potentially expose us to losses in excess of the amount received under the agreement Any of these events including claims for indemnification could seriously harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights our competitive position could be harmed or we could be required to incur significant expenses to enforce our rights We depend on our ability to protect our proprietary technology We rely on trade secret patent copyright and trademark laws and confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties all of which offer only limited protection The process of obtaining patent protection is expensive and timeconsuming and we may not be able to prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner We may choose not to seek patent protection for certain innovations and may choose not to pursue patent protection in certain jurisdictions Further we do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims To the extent that additional patents are issued from our patent applications which is not certain they may be contested circumvented or invalidated in the future Moreover the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages and as with any technology competitors may be able to develop similar or superior technologies to our own now or in the future In addition we rely on confidentiality or license agreements with third parties in connection with their use of our products and technology There is no guarantee that such parties will abide by the terms of such agreements or that we will be able to adequately enforce our rights in part because we rely on shrinkwrap licenses in some instances We have not registered our trademarks in all geographic markets Failure to secure those registrations could adversely affect our ability to enforce and defend our trademark rights and result in indemnification claims Further any claim of infringement by a third party even those claims without merit could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against such claim could divert management attention from our business and could require us to cease use of such intellectual property in certain geographic markets Despite our efforts the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to preclude misappropriation of our proprietary information or infringement of our intellectual property rights and our ability to police such misappropriation or infringement is uncertain particularly in countries outside of the United States 30 Detecting and protecting against the unauthorized use of our products technology and proprietary rights is expensive difficult and in some cases impossible Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others Such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of management resources either of which could harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects and there is no guarantee that we would be successful Furthermore many of our current and potential competitors have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to protecting their technology or intellectual property rights than we do Accordingly despite our efforts we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property which could result in a substantial loss of our market share We rely on the availability of licenses to thirdparty software and other intellectual property Many of our products and services include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties and we otherwise use software and other intellectual property licensed from third parties in our business This exposes us to risks over which we may have little or no control For example a licensor may have difficulties keeping up with technological changes or may stop supporting the software or other intellectual property that it licenses to us Also it will be necessary in the future to renew licenses expand the scope of existing licenses or seek new licenses relating to various aspects of these products and services or otherwise relating to our business which may result in increased license fees These licenses may not be available on acceptable terms if at all In addition a third party may assert that we or our end customers are in breach of the terms of a license which could among other things give such third party the right to terminate a license or seek damages from us or both The inability to obtain or maintain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain or maintain such licenses or rights on favorable terms or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters could result in delays in releases of products and services and could otherwise disrupt our business until equivalent technology can be identified licensed or developed if at all and integrated into our products and services or otherwise in the conduct of our business Moreover the inclusion in our products and services of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis may limit our ability to differentiate our products from those of our competitors Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects Our products contain thirdparty open source software components and failure to comply with the terms of the underlying open source software licenses could restrict our ability to sell our products Our products contain software modules licensed to us by thirdparty authors under open source licenses Use and distribution of open source software may entail greater risks than use of thirdparty commercial software as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code Some open source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the type of open source software that we use If we combine our software with open source software in a certain manner we could under certain open source licenses be required to release portions of the source code of our software to the public This would allow our competitors to create similar products with lower development effort and time and ultimately could result in a loss of product sales for us Although we monitor our use of open source software to avoid subjecting our products to conditions we do not intend the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by US courts and these licenses could be construed in a way that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products Moreover we cannot assure you that our processes for controlling our use of open source software in our products will be effective If we are held to have breached the terms of an open source software license we could be required to seek licenses from third parties to continue offering our products on terms that are not economically feasible to reengineer our products to discontinue the sale of our products if reengineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis or to make generally available in source code form our proprietary code any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects Sales of our 7000 Series of switches generate most of our product revenue and if we are unable to continue to grow sales of these products our business financial condition results of operations and prospects will suffer Historically we have derived substantially all of our product revenue from sales of our 7000 Series of switches and we expect to continue to do so for the foreseeable future We have experienced declines in sales prices for our products including our 10 Gigabit Ethernet modular and fixed switches A decline in the price of our 7000 Series of switches and related services or our inability to increase sales of these products would harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects more seriously than if we derived significant revenue from a larger variety of product lines and services Our future financial performance will also depend upon successfully developing and selling nextgeneration versions of our 7000 Series of switches If we fail to deliver new products new features or new releases that end customers want and that allow us to maintain leadership in what will continue to be a competitive market environment our business financial condition results of operations and prospects will be harmed We expect our gross margins to vary over time and to be adversely affected by numerous factors We expect our gross margins to vary over time and to be affected by numerous factors including  changes in endcustomer or product mix including mix of configurations within each product group  introduction of new products including products with priceperformance advantages 31  increases in material labor or other manufacturingrelated costs which could be significant especially during periods of supply constraints or as a result of changes in our manufacturing process or supply chain  our ability to reduce production costs  entry into new markets or growth in lower margin markets  entry in markets with different pricing and cost structures  pricing discounts  increases in material costs in the event we are restricted from sourcing components and manufacturing products internationally  costs associated with defending intellectual property infringement and other claims and the potential outcomes of such disputes such as those claims discussed in Legal Proceedings including the Cisco and Optumsoft litigation matters  excess inventory and inventory holding charges  obsolescence charges  changes in shipment volume  the timing of revenue recognition and revenue deferrals  increased cost loss of cost savings or dilution of savings due to changes in component pricing or charges incurred due to inventory holding periods if parts ordering does not correctly anticipate product demand or if the financial health of either contract manufacturers or suppliers deteriorates  lower than expected benefits from value engineering  increased price competition  changes in distribution channels  increased warranty costs and  how well we execute our strategy and operating plans To remain competitive we must successfully manage product introductions and transitions The success of new product introductions depends on a number of factors including but not limited to timely and successful product development market acceptance our ability to manage the risks associated with new product production rampup issues the availability of new merchant silicon chips the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory in line with anticipated product demand the availability of products in appropriate quantities and costs to meet anticipated demand and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects or deficiencies in the early stages of introduction Accordingly we cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product introductions and transitions on our business and results of operations Our sales cycles can be long and unpredictable and our sales efforts require considerable time and expense As a result our sales and revenue are difficult to predict and may vary substantially from period to period which may cause our results of operations to fluctuate significantly The timing of our sales and revenue recognition is difficult to predict because of the length and unpredictability of our products sales cycles A sales cycle is the period between initial contact with a prospective end customer and any sale of our products Endcustomer orders often involve the purchase of multiple products These orders are complex and difficult to complete because prospective end customers generally consider a number of factors over an extended period of time before committing to purchase the products and solutions we sell End customers especially in the case of our large end customers often view the purchase of our products as a significant and strategic decision and require considerable time to evaluate test and qualify our products prior to making a purchase decision and placing an order The length of time that end customers devote to their evaluation contract negotiation and budgeting processes varies significantly Our products sales cycles can be lengthy in certain cases especially with respect to our prospective large end customers During the sales cycle we expend significant time and money on sales and marketing activities and make investments in evaluation equipment all of which lower our operating margins particularly if no sale occurs Even if an end customer decides to purchase our products there are many factors affecting the timing of our recognition of revenue which makes our revenue difficult to forecast For example there may be unexpected delays in an end customers internal procurement processes particularly for some of our larger end customers for which our products represent a very small percentage of their total procurement activity There are many other factors specific to end customers that contribute to the timing of their purchases and the variability of our revenue recognition including the strategic importance of a particular project to an end customer budgetary constraints and changes in their personnel Even after an end customer makes a purchase there may be circumstances or terms relating to the purchase that delay our ability to recognize revenue from that purchase For example the sale of our products may be subject to acceptance testing In addition the significance and timing of our product enhancements and the introduction of new products by our competitors may also affect end customers purchases For all of these reasons it is difficult to predict whether a sale will be completed the particular period in which a sale will be completed or the period in which revenue from a sale will be recognized If our sales cycles lengthen our revenue could be lower than expected which would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects Our business depends on end customers renewing their maintenance and support contracts Any decline in maintenance renewals could harm our future business financial condition results of operations and prospects We typically sell our products with maintenance and support as part of the initial purchase and a portion of our annual revenue comes from renewals of maintenance and support contracts Our end customers have no obligation to renew their maintenance and support 32 contracts after the expiration of the initial period and they may elect not to renew their maintenance and support contracts to renew their maintenance and support contracts at lower prices through alternative channel partners or to reduce the product quantity under their maintenance and support contracts thereby reducing our future revenue from maintenance and support contracts If our end customers especially our large end customers do not renew their maintenance and support contracts or if they renew them on terms that are less favorable to us our revenue may decline and our business financial condition results of operations and prospects will suffer Industry consolidation may lead to increased competition and may harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects Most of our competitors have made acquisitions andor have entered into or extended partnerships or other strategic relationships to offer more comprehensive product lines including cloud networking solutions For example in the last few years alone Dell acquired Force10 and EMC IBM acquired Blade Network Technology Hewlett Packard Enterprises purchased Aruba Juniper acquired Contrail Cisco acquired Insieme and Broadcom which currently intends to acquire Brocade Moreover large system vendors are increasingly seeking to deliver toptobottom cloud networking solutions to end customers that combine cloudfocused hardware and software solutions to provide an alternative to our products We expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen their market positions in an evolving industry and as companies are acquired or are unable to continue operations Companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors thereby reducing their business with us Industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete with us including any competitors that seek to become sole source vendors for end customers This could lead to more variability in our results of operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects Our business is subject to the risks of warranty claims product returns product liability and product defects Our products are very complex and despite testing prior to their release they have contained and may contain undetected defects or errors especially when first introduced or when new versions are released Product defects or errors could affect the performance of our products and could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products adversely affect our reputation and our end customers willingness to buy products from us and adversely affect market acceptance or perception of our products Real or perceived errors failures or bugs in our products could cause us to lose revenue or market share increase our service costs cause us to incur substantial costs in redesigning the products cause us to lose significant endcustomers subject us to liability for damages and divert our resources from other tasks any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition Additionally real or perceived errors failures or bugs in our products could result in claims by end customers for losses that they sustain If end customers make these types of claims we may be required or may choose for endcustomer relations or other reasons to expend additional resources in order to address the problem We may also be required to repair or replace such products or provide a refund for the purchase price for such products Liability provisions in our standard terms and conditions of sale and those of our resellers and distributors may not be enforceable under some circumstances or may not fully or effectively protect us from endcustomer claims and related liabilities and costs including indemnification obligations under our agreements with end customers resellers and distributors The sale and support of our products also entail the risk of product liability claims We maintain insurance to protect against certain types of claims associated with the use of our products but our insurance coverage may not adequately cover any such claims In addition even claims that ultimately are unsuccessful could result in expenditures of funds in connection with litigation and divert managements time and other resources In addition to our own direct sales force we rely on distributors systems integrators and valueadded resellers to sell our products and our failure to effectively develop manage or prevent disruptions to our distribution channels and the processes and procedures that support them could cause a reduction in the number of end customers of our products Our future success is highly dependent upon maintaining our relationships with distributors systems integrators and valueadded resellers and establishing additional sales channel relationships We anticipate that sales of our products to a limited number of channel partners will continue to account for a material portion of our total product revenue for the foreseeable future We provide our channel partners with specific training and programs to assist them in selling our products but these steps may not be effective In addition our channel partners may be unsuccessful in marketing selling and supporting our products and services If we are unable to develop and maintain effective sales incentive programs for our channel partners we may not be able to incentivize these partners to sell our products to end customers These partners may have incentives to promote our competitors products to the detriment of our own or may cease selling our products altogether One of our channel partners could elect to consolidate or enter into a strategic partnership with one of our competitors which could reduce or eliminate our future opportunities with that channel partner Our agreements with our channel partners may generally be terminated for any reason by either party with advance notice We may be unable to retain these channel partners or secure additional or replacement channel partners The loss of one or more of our significant channel partners requires extensive training and any new or expanded relationship with a channel partner may take several months or more to achieve productivity Where we rely on the channel partners for sales of our products we may have little or no contact with the ultimate users of our products that purchase through such channel partners thereby making it more difficult for us to establish brand awareness ensure proper 33 delivery and installation of our products service ongoing endcustomer requirements estimate endcustomer demand and respond to evolving endcustomer needs In addition our channel partner sales structure could subject us to lawsuits potential liability and reputational harm if for example any of our channel partners misrepresent the functionality of our products or services to end customers fail to comply with their contractual obligations or violate laws or our corporate policies If we fail to effectively manage our existing sales channels or if our channel partners are unsuccessful in fulfilling the orders for our products if we are unable to enter into arrangements with and retain a sufficient number of highquality channel partners in each of the regions in which we sell products and keep them motivated to sell our products our ability to sell our products and our business financial condition results of operations and prospects will be harmed A portion of our revenue is generated by sales to government entities which are subject to a number of challenges and risks We anticipate increasing our sales efforts to US and foreign federal state and local governmental end customers in the future Sales to government entities are subject to a number of risks Selling to government entities can be highly competitive expensive and time consuming often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that these efforts will generate a sale The substantial majority of our sales to date to government entities have been made indirectly through our channel partners Government certification requirements for products like ours may change and in doing so restrict our ability to sell into the government sector until we have attained revised certifications Government demand and payment for our products and services may be affected by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations with funding reductions or delays adversely affecting public sector demand for our products and services Government entities may have statutory contractual or other legal rights to terminate contracts with our distributors and resellers for convenience or due to a default and any such termination may adversely impact our future business financial condition results of operations and prospects Selling to government entities may also require us to comply with various regulations that are not applicable to sales to nongovernment entities including regulations that may relate to pricing classified material and other matters Complying with such regulations may also require us to put in place controls and procedures to monitor compliance with the applicable regulations that may be costly or not possible We are not currently certified to perform work under classified contracts with government entities Failure to comply with any such regulations could adversely affect our business prospects results of operations and financial condition Governments routinely investigate and audit government contractors administrative processes and any unfavorable audit could result in the government ceasing to buy our products and services a reduction of revenue fines or civil or criminal liability if the audit uncovers improper or illegal activities any of which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects The US government may require certain products that it purchases to be manufactured in the US and other relatively highcost manufacturing locations and we may not manufacture all products in locations that meet these requirements Any of these and other circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects Our products must interoperate with operating systems software applications and hardware that is developed by others and if we are unable to devote the necessary resources to ensure that our products interoperate with such software and hardware we may lose or fail to increase market share and experience a weakening demand for our products Generally our products comprise only a part of the data center and must interoperate with our end customers existing infrastructure specifically their networks servers software and operating systems which may be manufactured by a wide variety of vendors and original equipment manufacturers or OEMs Our products must comply with established industry standards in order to interoperate with the servers storage software and other networking equipment in the data center such that all systems function efficiently together We depend on the vendors of servers and systems in a data center to support prevailing industry standards Often these vendors are significantly larger and more influential in driving industry standards than we are Also some industry standards may not be widely adopted or implemented uniformly and competing standards may emerge that may be preferred by our end customers In addition when new or updated versions of these software operating systems or applications are introduced we must sometimes develop updated versions of our software so that our products will interoperate properly We may not accomplish these development efforts quickly costeffectively or at all These development efforts require capital investment and the devotion of engineering resources If we fail to maintain compatibility with these systems and applications our end customers may not be able to adequately utilize our products and we may lose or fail to increase market share and experience a weakening in demand for our products among other consequences which would adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 34 We are subject to governmental export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets or subject us to liability if we violate these controls Our products may be subject to various export controls and because we incorporate encryption technology into certain of our products certain of our products may be exported from various countries only with the required export license or through an export license exception If we were to fail to comply with the applicable export control laws customs regulations economic sanctions or other applicable laws we could be subject to monetary damages or the imposition of restrictions which could be material to our business operating results and prospects and could also harm our reputation Further there could be criminal penalties for knowing or willful violations including incarceration for culpable employees and managers Obtaining the necessary export license or other authorization for a particular sale may be timeconsuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities Furthermore certain export control and economic sanctions laws prohibit the shipment of certain products technology software and services to embargoed countries and sanctioned governments entities and persons Even though we take precautions to ensure that our channel partners comply with all relevant regulations any failure by our channel partners to comply with such regulations could have negative consequences including reputational harm government investigations and penalties As our company grows we also continue developing procedures and controls to comply with export control and other applicable laws Historically we have had some instances where we inadvertently have not fully complied with certain export control laws but we have disclosed them to and implemented corrective actions with the appropriate government agencies In addition various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology including through import permit and license requirements and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or could limit our end customers ability to implement our products in those countries Any change in export or import regulations economic sanctions or related legislation shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or change in the countries governments persons or technologies targeted by such regulations could result in decreased use of our products by or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to existing or potential end customers with international operations or create delays in the introduction of our products into international markets Any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects Failure to comply with governmental laws and regulations could harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects Our business is subject to regulation by various federal state local and foreign governmental agencies including agencies responsible for monitoring and enforcing employment and labor laws workplace safety product safety environmental laws consumer protection laws antibribery laws importexport controls federal securities laws and tax laws and regulations In certain jurisdictions these regulatory requirements may be more stringent than those in the United States From time to time we may receive inquiries from such governmental agencies or we may make voluntary disclosures regarding our compliance with applicable governmental regulations or requirements relating to importexport controls federal securities laws and tax laws and regulations which could lead to formal investigations Noncompliance with applicable government regulations or requirements could subject us to sanctions mandatory product recalls enforcement actions disgorgement of profits fines damages civil and criminal penalties or injunctions If any governmental sanctions are imposed or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected In addition responding to any action will likely result in a significant diversion of managements attention and resources and an increase in professional fees Enforcement actions and sanctions could harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects We may invest in or acquire other businesses which could require significant management attention disrupt our business dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects As part of our business strategy we may make investments in complementary companies products or technologies which could involve licenses additional channels of distribution discount pricing or investments in or acquisitions of other companies However we do not have significant experience in making investments in other companies nor have we made any acquisitions to date and as a result our ability as an organization to evaluate andor complete investments or acquire and integrate other companies products or technologies in a successful manner is unproven We may not be able to find suitable investment or acquisition candidates and we may not be able to complete such investments or acquisitions on favorable terms if at all If we do complete investments or acquisitions we may not ultimately strengthen our competitive position or achieve our goals and any investments or acquisitions we complete could be viewed negatively by our end customers investors and securities analysts In addition investments and acquisitions may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures For example if we are unsuccessful at integrating any acquisitions or retaining key talent from those acquisitions or the technologies associated with such acquisitions into our company the business financial condition results of operations and prospects of the combined company could be adversely affected Any integration process may require significant time and resources and we may not be able to manage the process successfully We may not successfully evaluate or utilize the acquired technology or personnel or accurately forecast the financial effects of an acquisition transaction including accounting charges We may have to pay cash incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any such investment or acquisition each of which could adversely affect our financial condition or the market price of our common stock The sale of equity or issuance of debt to finance any such acquisitions could result in dilution to our stockholders The incurrence of 35 indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could also include covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations Moreover if the investment or acquisition becomes impaired we may be required to take an impairment charge which could adversely affect our financial condition or the market price of our common stock If we needed to raise additional capital to expand our operations and invest in new products our failure to do so on favorable terms could reduce our ability to compete and could harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects We expect that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for the foreseeable future If we did need to raise additional funds to expand our operations and invest in new products we may not be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms if at all If we raise additional equity financing our stockholders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interests and the market price of our common stock could decline Furthermore if we engage in debt financing the holders of such debt would have priority over the holders of common stock and we may be required to accept terms that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness or impose other restrictions on our business We may also be required to take other actions that would otherwise be in the interests of the debt holders including maintaining specified liquidity or other ratios any of which could harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects If we need additional capital and cannot raise it on acceptable terms if at all we may not be able to among other things  evolve or enhance our products and services  continue to expand our sales and marketing and research and development organizations  acquire complementary technologies products or businesses  expand operations in the US or internationally  hire train and retain employees or  respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated working capital requirements Our failure to do any of these things could seriously harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects If our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies are based on assumptions that change or prove to be incorrect our results of operations could fall below expectations of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in the market price of our common stock The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances as described in Part II Item 7 of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets liabilities equity revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources Significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition stockbased compensation contract manufacturing liabilities and income taxes If our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions our results of operations may be adversely affected and may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in the market price of our common stock We are exposed to the credit risk of our channel partners and some of our end customers which could result in material losses Most of our sales are on an open credit basis with standard payment terms of 30 days in the United States and because of local customs or conditions longer in some markets outside the US We monitor individual endcustomer payment capability in granting such open credit arrangements seek to limit such open credit to amounts we believe the end customers can pay and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for doubtful accounts We are unable to recognize revenue from shipments until the collection of those amounts becomes reasonably assured Any significant delay or default in the collection of significant accounts receivable could result in an increased need for us to obtain working capital from other sources possibly on worse terms than we could have negotiated if we had established such working capital resources prior to such delays or defaults Any significant default could adversely affect our results of operations and delay our ability to recognize revenue A material portion of our sales is derived through our distributors systems integrators and valueadded resellers Some of our distributors systems integrators and valueadded resellers may experience financial difficulties which could adversely affect our collection of accounts receivable Distributors tend to have more limited financial resources than other systems integrators valueadded resellers and end customers Distributors represent potential sources of increased credit risk because they may be less likely to have the reserve resources required to meet payment obligations Our exposure to credit risks of our channel partners may increase if our channel partners and their end customers are adversely affected by global or regional economic conditions One or more of these channel partners could delay payments or default on credit extended to them either of which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 36 If we or our partners fail to comply with environmental requirements our business financial condition results of operations prospects and reputation could be adversely affected We and our partners including our contract manufacturers are subject to various local state federal and international environmental laws and regulations including laws governing the hazardous material content of our products and laws relating to the collection recycling and disposal of electrical and electronic equipment Examples of these laws and regulations include the European Union or EU Restrictions on the use of Hazardous Substances Directive or RoHS Directive and the EU Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive or WEEE Directive as well as the implementing legislation of the EU member states Similar laws and regulations have been passed or are pending in China South Korea Norway and Japan and may be enacted in other regions including in the US and we or our partners including our contract manufacturers are or may in the future be subject to these laws and regulations The EU RoHS Directive and the similar laws of other jurisdictions limit the content of certain hazardous materials such as lead mercury and cadmium in the manufacture of electrical equipment including our products Our products currently comply with the RoHS Directive however if there are future changes to this directive we may be required to reengineer our products to use components compatible with these regulations This reengineering and component substitution could result in additional costs to us or disrupt our operations or logistics We are also subject to environmental laws and regulations governing the management and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes Our failure or the failure of our partners including our contract manufacturers to comply with past present and future environmental laws could result in fines penalties thirdparty claims reduced sales of our products substantial product inventory writeoffs and reputational damage any of which could harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects We also expect that our business will be affected by new environmental laws and regulations on an ongoing basis applicable to us and our partners including our contract manufacturers To date our expenditures for environmental compliance have not had a material effect on our results of operations or cash flows Although we cannot predict the future effect of such laws or regulations they will likely result in additional costs or require us to change the content or manufacturing of our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects Our sales contracts are primarily denominated in US dollars and therefore substantially all of our revenue is not subject to foreign currency risk However a strengthening US dollar could increase the real cost of our products to our end customers outside of the US which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects In addition a decrease in the value of the US dollar relative to foreign currencies could increase our product and operating costs in foreign locations Further an increasing portion of our operating expenses is incurred outside the US is denominated in foreign currencies and is subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates If we are not able to successfully hedge against the risks associated with the currency fluctuations our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected Our business is subject to the risks of earthquakes fire power outages floods and other catastrophic events and to interruption by manmade problems such as terrorism Our corporate headquarters and the operations of our key manufacturing vendors logistics providers and partners as well as many of our customers are located in areas exposed to risks of natural disasters such as earthquakes and tsunamis including the San Francisco Bay area Japan and Taiwan A significant natural disaster such as an earthquake tsunami fire or a flood or other catastrophic event such as a disease outbreak could have a material adverse effect on our or their business which could in turn materially affect our financial condition results of operations and prospects For example in the event our service providers information technology systems or manufacturing or logistics abilities are hindered by any of the events discussed above shipments could be delayed which could result in missed financial targets such as revenue and shipment targets for a particular quarter Further if a natural disaster occurs in a region from which we derive a significant portion of our revenue end customers in that region may delay or forego purchases of our products which may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects In addition acts of terrorism could cause disruptions in our business or the business of our manufacturer logistics providers partners or end customers or the economy as a whole Given our typical concentration of sales at each quarter end any disruption in the business of our manufacturer logistics providers partners or end customers that affects sales at the end of our quarter could have a particularly significant adverse effect on our quarterly results All of the aforementioned risks may be augmented if our disaster recovery plans and those of our manufacturers logistics providers or partners prove to be inadequate To the extent that any of the above results in delays or cancellations of endcustomer orders or delays in the manufacture deployment or shipment of our products our business financial condition results of operations and prospects would be adversely affected 37 Breaches of our cybersecurity systems could degrade our ability to conduct our business operations and deliver products and services to our customers delay our ability to recognize revenue compromise the integrity of our software products result in significant data losses and the theft of our intellectual property damage our reputation expose us to liability to third parties and require us to incur significant additional costs to maintain the security of our networks and data We increasingly depend upon our IT systems to conduct virtually all of our business operations ranging from our internal operations and product development activities to our marketing and sales efforts and communications with our customers and business partners Computer programmers may attempt to penetrate our network security or that of our website and misappropriate our proprietary information or cause interruptions of our service Because the techniques used by such computer programmers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques In addition sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture including bugs and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system We have also outsourced a number of our business functions to thirdparties including our manufacturers logistics providers and cloud service providers and our business operations also depend in part on the success of these third parties own cybersecurity measures Similarly we rely upon distributors resellers and system integrators to sell our products and our sales operations depend in part on the reliability of their cybersecurity measures Additionally we depend upon our employees to appropriately handle confidential data and deploy our IT resources in safe and secure fashion that does not expose our network systems to security breaches and the loss of data Accordingly if our cybersecurity systems and those of our contractors fail to protect against unauthorized access sophisticated cyber attacks and the mishandling of data by our employees and contractors our ability to conduct our business effectively could be damaged in a number of ways including  sensitive data regarding our business including intellectual property and other proprietary data could be stolen  our electronic communications systems including email and other methods could be disrupted and our ability to conduct our business operations could be seriously damaged until such systems can be restored  our ability to process customer orders and electronically deliver products and services could be degraded and our distribution channels could be disrupted resulting in delays in revenue recognition  defects and security vulnerabilities could be introduced into our software thereby damaging the reputation and perceived reliability and security of our products and potentially making the data systems of our customers vulnerable to further data loss and cyber incidents and  personally identifiable data of our customers employees and business partners could be compromised Should any of the above events occur we could be subject to significant claims for liability from our customers and regulatory actions from governmental agencies In addition our ability to protect our intellectual property rights could be compromised and our reputation and competitive position could be significantly harmed Also the regulatory and contractual actions litigations investigations fines penalties and liabilities relating to data breaches that result in losses of personally identifiable or credit card information of users of our services can be significant in terms of fines and reputational impact and necessitate changes to our business operations that may be disruptive to us Additionally we could incur significant costs in order to upgrade our cybersecurity systems and remediate damages Consequently our financial performance and results of operations could be adversely affected We believe our longterm value as a company will be greater if we focus primarily on growth instead of profitability Our business strategy is to focus primarily on our longterm growth As a result our profitability in any given period may be lower than it would be if our strategy was to maximize shortterm profitability Expenditures on research and development sales and marketing infrastructure and other such investments may not ultimately grow our business prospects or cause long term profitability For example in order to support our strong growth we have accelerated our investment in infrastructure such as enterprise resource planning software and other technologies to improve the efficiency of our operations As a result we expect our levels of operating profit could decline in the short to medium term If we are ultimately unable to achieve or maintain profitability at the level anticipated by analysts and our stockholders the market price of our common stock may decline We may not generate positive returns on our research and development investments Developing our products is expensive and the investment in product development may involve a long payback cycle For the years ended December 31 2016  2015 and 2014  our research and development expenses were 2736 million  or approximately 242 of our revenue 2094 million or approximately 250 of our revenue and 1489 million or approximately 255 of our revenue respectively We expect to continue to invest heavily in software development in order to expand the capabilities of our cloud networking platform introduce new products and features and build upon our technology leadership We believe one of our greatest strengths lies in the speed of our product development efforts By investing in research and development we believe we will be well positioned to continue our rapid growth and take advantage of our large market opportunity We expect that our results of operations will be impacted by the timing and size of these investments These investments may take several years to generate positive returns if ever 38 We provide access to our software and other selected source code to certain partners which creates additional risk that our competitors could develop products that are similar to or better than ours Our success and ability to compete depend substantially upon our internally developed technology which is incorporated in the source code for our products We seek to protect the source code design code documentation and other information relating to our software under trade secret patent and copyright laws However we have chosen to provide access to selected source code of our software to several of our partners for codevelopment as well as for open application programming interfaces or APIs formats and protocols Though we generally control access to our source code and other intellectual property and enter into confidentiality or license agreements with such partners as well as with our employees and consultants this combination of procedural and contractual safeguards may be insufficient to protect our trade secrets and other rights to our technology Our protective measures may be inadequate especially because we may not be able to prevent our partners employees or consultants from violating any agreements or licenses we may have in place or abusing their access granted to our source code Improper disclosure or use of our source code could help competitors develop products similar to or better than ours Changes in our provision for income taxes or our effective tax rate the enactment of new tax laws or changes in the application of existing tax laws of various jurisdictions or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results Our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by several factors many of which are outside of our control including earnings that are lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates our ability to generate and use tax attributes changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities expiration of or lapses in the federal research and development RD tax credit laws transfer pricing adjustments including the effect of acquisitions on our intercompany RD cost sharing arrangement and legal structure tax effects of nondeductible compensation including certain stockbased compensation tax costs related to intercompany realignments changes in accounting principles adverse tax consequences including imposition of withholding or other taxes on payments by subsidiaries or customers a change in our decision to indefinitely reinvest foreign earnings or changes in tax laws and regulations including possible US changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income or the foreign tax credit rules Significant judgment is required to evaluate our tax positions and determine our provision for income taxes The accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes applies to all income tax positions including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes which if settled unfavorably could adversely affect our provision for income taxes or additional paidin capital In addition tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied Recent changes to US tax laws including limitations on the ability of taxpayers to claim and utilize foreign tax credits and the deferral of certain tax deductions until earnings outside of the US are repatriated to the US as well as changes to US tax laws that may be enacted in the future could impact the tax treatment of our foreign earnings as well as cash and cash equivalent balances we currently maintain outside of the US Furthermore due to shifting economic and political conditions tax policies or rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change Further we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities Audits by the Internal Revenue Service or other tax authorities are subject to inherent uncertainties and could result in unfavorable outcomes including potential fines or penalties As we operate in numerous taxing jurisdictions the application of tax laws can be subject to diverging and sometimes conflicting interpretations by tax authorities of these jurisdictions The expense of defending and resolving such an audit may be significant The amount of time to resolve an audit is also unpredictable and may divert managements attention from our business operations We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes We cannot assure you that fluctuations in our provision for income taxes or our effective tax rate the enactment of new tax laws or changes in the application or interpretation of existing tax laws or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our tax returns by tax authorities will not have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects If we do not effectively expand and train our direct sales force we may be unable to add new end customers or increase sales to our existing end customers and our business will be adversely affected We depend on our direct sales force to obtain new end customers and increase sales with existing end customers As such we have invested and will continue to invest in our sales organization In recent periods we have been adding personnel and other resources to our sales function as we focus on growing our business entering new markets and increasing our market share and we expect to incur additional expenses in expanding our sales personnel in order to achieve revenue growth There is significant competition for sales personnel with the skills and technical knowledge that we require Our ability to achieve significant revenue growth will depend in large part on our success in recruiting training retaining and integrating sufficient numbers of sales personnel to support our growth particularly in international markets New hires require significant training and may take significant time before they achieve full productivity Our recent hires and planned hires may not become productive as quickly as we expect and we may be unable to hire retain or integrate into our corporate culture sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the markets where we do business or plan to do business In addition because we continue to grow rapidly a large percentage of our sales force is new to our company If we are unable to hire integrate and train a sufficient number of effective sales personnel or the sales personnel we hire are not successful in obtaining new end customers 39 or increasing sales to our existing endcustomer base our business financial condition results of operations and prospects will be adversely affected Regulations related to conflict minerals may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the costs of certain metals used in the manufacturing of our products As a public company we are subject to requirements under the DoddFrank that will require us to perform diligence and disclose and report whether or not our products contain conflict minerals The implementation of these requirements could adversely affect the sourcing availability and pricing of the materials used in the manufacture of components used in our products In addition we will incur additional costs to comply with these disclosure requirements including costs related to conducting diligence procedures and if applicable potential changes to products processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities We may also face reputational harm if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflictfree or if we are unable to alter our products processes or sources of supply to avoid such materials Risks Related to the Securities Markets and Ownership of Our Common Stock The market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile and the value of your investment could decline The trading price of our common stock has historically been and is likely to continue to be volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors some of which are beyond our control These fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our common stock Factors that could cause fluctuations in the market price of our common stock include the following  actual or anticipated announcements of new products services or technologies commercial relationships acquisitions or other events by us or our competitors  forward looking statements related to future revenue gross margins and earnings per share  price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time  litigation involving us our industry or both including events occurring in our litigation with Cisco Systems and Optumsoft  manufacturing supply or distribution shortages or constraints or challenges with adding or changing our manufacturing process or supply chain  significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of technology companies in general and of companies in the IT security industry in particular  fluctuations in the trading volume of our shares or the size of our public float  sales by our officers directors or significant stockholders  actual or anticipated changes or fluctuations in our results of operations  adverse changes to our relationships with any of our channel partners  whether our results of operations or our financial outlook for future fiscal periods meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors  actual or anticipated changes in the expectations of investors or securities analysts  regulatory developments in the US foreign countries or both  general economic conditions and trends  major catastrophic events  sales of large blocks of our common stock or  departures of key personnel In addition technology stocks have historically experienced high levels of volatility and if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences a loss of investor confidence the market price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business financial condition results of operations and prospects The market price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies in our industry even if these events do not directly affect us In the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a companys securities securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company If the market price of our common stock is volatile we may become the target of securities litigation Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our managements attention and resources from our business and prospects This could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public markets or the perception that such sales might occur could reduce the market price that our common stock might otherwise attain and may dilute your voting power and your ownership interest in us Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that such sales could occur could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and may make it more difficult for you to sell your common stock at a time and price that you deem appropriate and may dilute your voting power and your ownership interest in us Based on approximately 708 million shares outstanding as of December 31 2016  holders of approximately 274 of our common stock have rights subject to some conditions to require us to file registration statements covering the sale of their shares or to 40 include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders In addition we have registered the offer and sale of all shares of common stock that we may issue under our equity compensation plans If holders by exercising their registration rights sell large numbers of shares it could adversely affect the market price of our common stock We may also issue shares of common stock or securities convertible into our common stock in connection with a financing acquisition our equity incentive plans or otherwise Any such issuances would result in dilution to our existing stockholders and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock Insiders have substantial control over us which could limit your ability to influence the outcome of key transactions including a change of control Our directors executive officers and each of our stockholders who own greater than 10 of our outstanding common stock together with their affiliates in the aggregate beneficially own approximately 278 of the outstanding shares of our common stock based on shares outstanding as of December 31 2016  As a result these stockholders if acting together could exercise a significant level of influence over matters requiring approval by our stockholders including the election of directors and the approval of mergers acquisitions or other extraordinary transactions They may also have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you disagree and which may be adverse to your interests This concentration of ownership may also discourage a potential investor from acquiring our common stock due to the limited voting power of such stock or otherwise may have the effect of delaying preventing or deterring a change of control of our company could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of our company and might ultimately affect the market price of our common stock We do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future We have never declared nor paid any dividends on our common stock We intend to retain any earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business and prospects and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the future As a result you may only receive a return on your investment in our common stock if the market price of our common stock increases If securities or industry analysts publish inaccurate or unfavorable research reports about our business or prospects the market price of our common stock and trading volume could decline The trading market for our common stock to some extent depends on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business or prospects We do not have any control over these analysts If one or more of the analysts who cover us should downgrade our shares or change their opinion of our shares the market price of our common stock would likely decline If one or more of these analysts should cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us we could lose visibility in the financial markets which could cause the market price of our common stock or trading volume to decline Our charter documents and Delaware law could discourage takeover attempts and lead to management entrenchment Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company These provisions could also make it difficult for stockholders to elect directors that are not nominated by the current members of our board of directors or take other corporate actions including effecting changes in our management These provisions include  a classified board of directors with threeyear staggered terms which could delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our board of directors  the ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares including preferences and voting rights without stockholder approval which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer  the exclusive right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of our board of directors or the resignation death or removal of a director which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors  a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders  the requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the chairman of our board of directors our president our secretary or a majority vote of our board of directors which could delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action including the removal of directors  the requirement for the affirmative vote of holders of at least 66 23 of the voting power of all of the then outstanding shares of the voting stock voting together as a single class to amend the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation relating to the issuance of preferred stock and management of our business or our amended and restated bylaws which may inhibit the ability of an acquirer to effect such amendments to facilitate an unsolicited takeover attempt  the ability of our board of directors by majority vote to amend the bylaws which may allow our board of directors to take additional actions to prevent an unsolicited takeover and inhibit the ability of an acquirer to amend the bylaws to facilitate an unsolicited takeover attempt and 41  advance notice procedures with which stockholders must comply to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders meeting which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirers own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us In addition as a Delaware corporation we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law These provisions may prohibit large stockholders in particular those owning 15 or more of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a certain period of time The issuance of additional stock in connection with financings acquisitions investments our stock incentive plans or otherwise will dilute all other stockholders Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue up to 1000000000 shares of common stock and up to 100000000 shares of preferred stock with such rights and preferences as may be determined by our board of directors Subject to compliance with applicable rules and regulations we may issue our shares of common stock or securities convertible into our common stock from time to time in connection with a financing acquisition investment our stock incentive plans or otherwise We may from time to time issue additional shares of common stock at a discount from the then market price of our common stock Any issuance of stock could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and cause the market price of our common stock to decline 42 Item 1B Unresolved Staff Comments
