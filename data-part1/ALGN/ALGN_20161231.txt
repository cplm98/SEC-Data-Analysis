Malocclusion or the misalignment of teeth is one of the most prevalent clinical dental conditions affecting billions of people or approximately 60 to 75 of the population Annually approximately 10 million people in major developed countries elect treatment by orthodontists worldwide of which approximately 50 or 5 million have mild to moderate malocclusion and are applicable to Invisalign treatment  our served market In addition approximately 100 million people with malocclusion want to straighten their teeth however they will not seek orthodontic treatment in a doctors office and would instead elect to receive clear aligner treatment in the convenience of their own home  referred to as the doctordirected at home market In the US orthodontists and GPs treat malocclusion primarily with metal arch wires and brackets referred to as braces and they may augment braces with elastics metal expanders headgear or functional appliances and other ancillary devices as needed Available options for improving treatment aesthetics include the use of ceramic toothcolored brackets or bonding brackets on the inside or lingual surface of the patients teeth The average treatment takes approximately 12 to 24 months to complete and requires several hours of direct dental professional involvement known in the industry as chair time including the initial diagnosis creation of an appropriate treatment plan and bonding of the brackets to the patients teeth and attachment of arch wires to the brackets Subsequent visits involve tightening or otherwise adjusting the braces approximately every six weeks until the final visit when the dental professional removes each bracket and residual bonding agent from the patients teeth Upon completion of the treatment the dental professional may at his or her discretion have the patient use a retainer GPs may also combine orthodontic treatment with restorative treatment Many times the dental professional may need to move certain teeth or roots out of the way to create more space for implant placement or move teeth to create space for restorations of missing teeth In addition GPs may need to move or adjust teeth or spaces to be able to place better restorations The orthodontic portion of treatment generally comes before the restorative portion The Invisalign System The Invisalign System is a proprietary method for treating malocclusion based on a series of doctorprescribed custom manufactured clear plastic removable orthodontic aligners The Invisalign System offers a range of treatment options specialized services and proprietary software for treatment visualization and is comprised of the following phases Orthodontic diagnosis and transmission of treatment data to us  The Invisaligntrained dental professional prepares and sends us a patients treatment data package which consists of a prescription form a polyvinylsiloxane or PVS impression of the relevant dental arches photographs of the patient and at the dental professionals election xrays of the patients dentition The Invisaligntrained dental professional can also submit an intraoral digital scan instead of a physical PVS impression through either Aligns iTero scanner or several thirdparty scanners See Third Party Scanners Preparation of computersimulated treatment plan  Upon receipt we use the treatment data package to construct digital models of the patients dentition In cases where a PVS impression has been submitted we use computed tomography known as CT scanning to develop a digital threedimensional computer model of the patients current dentition In cases where the dental professional submits a digital scan this step in the process is eliminated We transform this initial digital model into a proposed custom threedimensional treatment plan called a ClinCheck treatment plan The ClinCheck treatment plan simulates 4 appropriate tooth movement broken down into a series of increments and details timing and placement of any attachments that will be used during treatment Attachments are toothcolored buttons that are sometimes used to increase the biomechanical force on a specific tooth or teeth in order to effect the desired movement Review and approval of the treatment plan by an Invisalign provider The patients ClinCheck treatment plan is then made available to the prescribing dental professional via the Invisalign Doctor Site which enables the dental professional to project tooth movement with a level of accuracy not previously possible with metal arch wires and brackets By reviewing modifying as needed and approving the treatment plan the dental professional retains control over the treatment plan Manufacture of custom aligners Upon the dental professionals approval of the ClinCheck treatment plan we use the data underlying the simulation in conjunction with stereolithography technology a form of 3D printing technology to construct a series of molds depicting the future position of the patients teeth Each mold is a replica of the patients teeth at each stage of the simulated course of treatment From these molds aligners are fabricated by pressureforming polymeric sheets over each mold Aligners are thin clear plastic removable dental appliances that are custom manufactured in a series to correspond to each stage of the ClinCheck treatment plan Shipment to the dental professional and patient aligner wear All the aligners for a patient are shipped directly to the dental professional who then dispenses them to the patient at regular checkup intervals throughout the treatment Aligners are generally worn for consecutive twoweek periods or less which correspond to the approved ClinCheck treatment plan The patient replaces the aligners with the next pair in the series when prescribed advancing tooth movement with each aligner stage Throughout treatment the doctor may place attachments or use other auxiliaries to achieve desired tooth movements per the doctors original prescription and resulting ClinCheck treatment plan In October 2016 we introduced oneweek aligner wear At the treating doctors discretion we recommend changing from twoweek aligner wear to oneweek aligner wear for Invisalign treatments with Invisalign Full Invisalign Teen and Invisalign Assist products thereby reducing treatment time by up to 50 Aligns recommendation is based on clinical analysis of more than 200 inprogress Invisalign cases data on file and the experiences of numerous Invisalign providers Treatment progress and request for additional aligners  Should the dental professional determine that the treatment is not tracking for various reasons such as patient compliance certain teeth not tracking to plan or they need to extend the treatment a few stages further to achieve their treatment goals the dental professional can request additional aligners at no charge at any point during the treatment subject to certain requirements Clear Aligner Products Comprehensive Products Invisalign Full  Used for a wide range of malocclusion the Invisalign Full treatment consists of the number of aligners necessary to achieve the doctors treatment goals Invisalign Full treatment aligners are manufactured and then delivered to the dental professionals in a single shipment Invisalign Full is sold in the US Canada and our international regions Invisalign Teen The Invisalign Teen treatment includes all the features of Invisalign Full treatment plus additional features that address the orthodontic needs of teenage patients such as compliance indicators compensation for tooth eruption and six free single arch replacement aligners This product is predominantly marketed to orthodontists who treat the vast majority of malocclusion in teenage patients Invisalign Teen treatment aligners other than the replacement aligners are manufactured and then delivered to the dental professionals in a single shipment Invisalign Teen is sold in the US Canada and our international regions Invisalign Assist Used for anterior alignment and aestheticallyoriented cases the Invisalign Assist treatment offers added support to our dental practitioners throughout the treatment process including progress tracking that allows the dental professional to submit new impressions every nine stages When the progress tracking feature is selected aligners are shipped to the dental professional after every nine stages thereby helping to achieve successful treatment outcomes Predominantly marketed to GPs Invisalign Assist is intended to make it easier to select appropriate cases for their experience level or treatment approach submit cases more efficiently and manage appointments with suggested tasks Invisalign Assist is sold in the US and Canada 5 NonComprehensive Products Invisalign Express 10 and 5 and Invisalign Litei7 Invisalign Express treatments Invisalign Lite treatment and Invisalign i7 treatment

our international regions use up to 14 and 7 sets of aligners respectively For Invisalign ExpressLitei7 aligners are manufactured and then delivered to the dental professionals in a single shipment Invisalign Go A simplified and streamlined solution designed for GP dentists to more easily identify and treat patients with mild malocclusion Invisalign Go combines case assessment support a simplified ClinCheck treatment plan and a progress assessment feature for case monitoring Invisalign Go was launched in core European markets in the fourth quarter of 2016 and is expected to launch in North America in the first quarter of 2017 SmileDirectClub Aligners On July 25 2016 we entered into a supply agreement with SmileDirectClub LLC SDC to manufacture nonInvisalign clear aligners for SDCs doctorled athome program for simple teeth straightening In October 2016 we became SDCs exclusive thirdparty supplier and began supplying aligners directly to SDC SDC aligners include up to 20 stages without attachments or interproximal reduction IPR Align manufactures the aligners per SDCs specifications for minor tooth movement using EX30 aligner material NonCase Products Clear Aligner noncase products include retention products Invisalign training fees and sales of ancillary products such as cleaning material and adjusting tools used by dental professionals during the course of treatment Retention  We offer two products for post treatment retention The first is a single set of custom clear aligner retainers The second is offered as a set of four custom clear aligners called Vivera Retainers made with proprietary material strong enough to maintain tooth position and correct minor relapse if necessary A shipment of four sets are available to both Invisalign and nonInvisalign patients Feature Enhancements We have consistently introduced enhanced features across the Invisalign System over the past several years such as Invisalign G3 launched in October 2010 Invisalign G4 launched in November 2011 Invisalign G5 launched in February 2014 and Invisalign G6 launched in March 2015 In October 2016 we launched Invisalign G7 a set of features designed to deliver greater control of tooth movements and improved treatment outcomes Invisalign G5 innovations for deep bite is engineered to improve clinical outcomes in deep bite treatment with Invisalign treatment Comprehensive features dedicated to deep bite treatment include new SmartForce features that are designed to level the curve of spee by improving control of anterior intrusion and premolar extrusion for more predictable deep bite treatments and precision bite ramps that are designed to disocclude the posterior teeth for improved efficiency in deep bite treatments Invisalign G6 clinical innovations for first premolar extraction is engineered to improve clinical outcomes for orthodontic treatment of severe crowding and bimaxillary protrusion Feature enhancements include new SmartStage programmed tooth movements that optimize the progression of tooth movements and provide aligner activation engineered to eliminate unwanted tipping and unwanted anterior extrusion during retraction and new SmartForce features that are designed to deliver the force systems necessary to achieve predictable tooth movements Invisalign G7 builds on earlier Invisalign Gseries releases with new features to finetune certain tooth movements and deliver treatment outcome quality that Invisalign providers expect particularly with teenage patients Powered by Invisalign SmartStage technology that optimizes the staging and sequence of tooth movements and aligner activation for greater predictability Invisalign G7 delivers better upper lateral control improved root control and features to address prevention of posterior open bites SmartTrack  Aligner Material SmartTrack is a proprietary customengineered Invisalign clear aligner material that delivers gentle more constant force considered ideal for orthodontic tooth movements Conventional aligner materials relax and lose a substantial percent of energy in the initial days of aligner wear but SmartTrack maintains more constant force over the period of time the patient wears the 6 aligners The flexible SmartTrack material also more precisely conforms to tooth morphology attachments and interproximal spaces to improve control of tooth movement throughout treatment Scanner Segment Intraoral scanning is an emerging technology that we believe will have substantial impact on the future of dentistry By enabling the dental practitioner to create a 3D image of the patients teeth digital scan using a handheld intraoral scanner inside the mouth digital scanning is more efficient and precise and more comfortable for patients compared to the mess discomfort and subjective nature of taking physical impressions The digitally scanned model is more accurate than a physical impression and substantially reduces the rate of restoration remakes so patients are recalled less often and the appointment time for the restoration is shorter because of fewer adjustments which results in greater overall patient satisfaction The digital model file can be used for various procedures and services including fabrication of physical dental models for use by labs to create restorative units such as veneers inlays onlays crowns bridges and implant abutments digital records storage orthodontic diagnosis orthodontic retainers and appliances and Invisalign digital impression submission iTero Scanner  The iTero scanner is available as a single hardware platform with software options for restorative or orthodontic procedures In March 2015 we announced our next generation iTero Element Intraoral Scanner which features a more compact footprint enhanced wand and multitouch display and is engineered to enable faster scan speeds for more efficient realtime clinical evaluation We began shipping the iTero Element Intraoral Scanner in September 2015 We market and sell the iTero Element in North America and in select international markets The iTero scanner is interoperable with our Invisalign treatment such that a full arch digital scan can be submitted as part of the Invisalign case submission process In addition the Invisalign Outcome Simulator and features are exclusive to the iTero scanner Restorative software for iTero Software designed for GPs prosthodontists periodontists and oral surgeons which includes features for restorative procedures commonly performed in their practices such as veneers inlays onlays crowns bridges and implants The iTero restorative software provides the ability to scan quadrants and full arches and allows simple powderfree capture of digital impressions for singleunit cases as well as more complex restorative and implant treatment plans The iTero software also contains Invisalign interoperability to support clear aligner orthodontic treatment Orthodontic software for iTero Software designed for orthodontists for digital records storage orthodontic diagnosis Invisalign digital impression submission and for the fabrication of printed models and retainers The iTero orthodontic software digitally captures the contours of the dentition and the gingival structures providing an accurate powderfree digital orthodontic scan in just minutes This digital impression procedure ensures a more comfortable patient experience and produces a precise scan that can be seamlessly integrated with Invisalign treatment OrthoCAD iCast and OrthoCAD iRecord which allows a doctor to utilize sophisticated measurement and treatment planning tools CADCAM Services iTero Models and Dies An accurate physical model and dies are manufactured based on the digital scan and sent to the laboratory of the dentists choice for completion of the needed restoration The laboratory also has the option to export the digital file for immediate production of coping and fullcontour restorations on their laboratory CADCAM systems The laboratory conducts then completes the ceramic buildup or staining and glazing and delivers the end result  a precisely fitting restoration iTero prosthetics have a nearzero remake rate OrthoCAD iCast iCast provides a digital alternative to traditional stone cast models which allows for simplified storage and digital record retrieval The iCast digital model contains a full American Board of Orthodontics ABO base and is available from an iTero scan or from a traditional alginate impression OrthoCAD iRecord iRecord scans provide a digital alternative to traditional stone cast models which allows for simplified storage and digital record retrieval iRecord scan data may also be exported to orthodontic laboratories for the fabrication of retainers orthodontic appliances and hard model fabrication Third Party Scanners and Digital scans for Invisalign treatment submission  We support an open systems approach to digital scans and other intraoral scanning companies interested in qualifying their scanners to submit a digital impression in place of a traditional PVS impression as part of the Invisalign case submission process We have qualified several scanners for digital scan submission including 3M True Definition scanner January 2014 the Sirona CEREC Omnicam scanner March 2015 and certain TRIOS scanners October 2016 7 Chair Side Applications Invisalign Outcome Simulator  The Invisalign Outcome Simulator is an exclusive chairside and cloudbased application for the iTero scanner that allows doctors to help patients visualize how their teeth may look at the end of Invisalign treatment through a dual view layout that shows a prospective patient an image of hisher own current dentition next to hisher simulated final position after Invisalign treatment Using a full arch digital scan the Invisalign Outcome Simulator takes a few minutes to run and may be viewed chairside on the scanner or from a computer using MyAlignTechcom Intuitive tools allow doctors to make realtime adjustments to individual teeth during consultations that increase patient education and the likelihood of patient acceptance In October 2016 we introduced the following new features in the 40 upgrade  3D Progress Tracking  Ability to compare a patients new scan with a specific stage of their ClinCheck treatment plan to visually assess and communicate Invisalign treatment progress with an easy to read colorcoded tooth movement report that allows the doctor to know how each tooth is tracking  Patient Simulation Sharing  Ability to easily share the patients 3D simulated Invisalign treatment outcome through a protected patient portal which can be viewed on smartphones tablets and computers Our iTero scanner includes orthodontic software andor restorative software and the Invisalign Outcome Simulator The orthodontic or restorative software may also be purchased subsequently for an upgrade fee The Invisalign Outcome Simulator is not available for sale separately Other proprietary software mentioned in this Annual Report on Form 10K such as ClinCheck and ClinCheck Pro software the Invisalign Doctor Site and enhanced feature solutions such as Invisalign G7 are included as part of the Invisalign System and are not sold separately nor do they contribute as individual items of revenue Business Strategy Our goal is to establish Invisalign clear aligners as the standard method for treating malocclusion and to establish the iTero intraoral scanner as the preferred scanning protocol for 3D digital scans ultimately driving increased product adoption by dental professionals We intend to achieve this by continued focus and execution of our strategic growth drivers International Orthodontists Utilization GP Dentists Treat  Refer and Patient Demand  Conversion 1 International Expansion  We expect to continue to grow and expand our business by investing in resources infrastructure and initiatives that will drive Invisalign treatment growth in our current and new international markets As our core countries within the EMEA and APAC regions continue to grow in both number of new Invisalign providers and utilization we strive to make sure we can support that growth through investments such as headcount clinical support education and advertising Additionally we are expanding our presence and entering new markets such as India and Korea by establishing a solid base of key opinion leaders and early adopters who can help build clinical confidence in the orthodontic community and create strong brand preference for Invisalign treatment among consumers We have also transitioned most of our indirect smaller country markets to a direct sales model and while we do not expect a material impact from these countries for some time in the near term we will leverage our existing infrastructure in adjacent country markets as we build local sales organizations to drive longterm market penetration 2 Orthodontist Utilization We want all of our orthodontist providers to have the confidence and motivation to lead with Invisalign for every patient that walks into their practice We strive to achieve this by increasing the product applicability and predictability for a wide range of complex cases within adults teenagers and younger aged patients As an example in 2015 we launched Invisalign G6 clinical innovations for first premolar extractions The nature of malocclusion that requires first premolar tooth extraction is an orthodontic problem that affects more than 50 of people in Asia 20 in Europe and 12 in North America In October 2016 we launched Invisalign G7 which builds on earlier Invisalign Gseries releases with new features to finetune certain tooth movements and deliver treatment outcome quality that Invisalign providers expect particularly with teenage patients We also continue to make improvements to our Invisalign treatment software ClinCheck Pro designed to deliver an exceptional user experience and increase treatment control to help our doctors achieve their treatment goals 3 GP Dentist Treat  Refer We want to make it easier for GPs to identify the cases that they can treat and refer the cases that are too complex over to orthodontists Although GPs have a larger pool of potential patients which can expand the market for Invisalign treatment overall we need to provide them with tools to help them quickly identify cases they can treat monitor patient progress or if needed help refer them more easily to an orthodontist The iTero scanner is an important component to that customer experience In October 2016 we introduced a 3D progress tracking feature in the 8 Invisalign Outcome Simulator application that provides our customers with the ability to compare a patients new scan with a specific stage of their ClinCheck treatment plan to visually assess and communicate Invisalign treatment progress 4 Patient Demand  Conversion Our goal is to make Invisalign a highly recognized name brand worldwide by creating awareness for Invisalign treatment among consumers and motiving potential patients to seek treatment from an Invisalign provider In support of this objective we invest in initiatives designed to strengthen our global brand name recognition drive patient demand and covert that interest into Invisalign treatment case starts We accomplish this objective through an integrated consumer marketing strategy that includes television media social networking and event marketing as well as educating patients on treatment options and directing them to high volume Invisalign providers Supply Agreement with SmileDirectClub LLC On July 28 2016 we announced a supply agreement with SmileDirectClub LLC SDC to manufacture nonInvisalign clear aligners for SDCs doctorled athome program for affordable cosmetic teeth straightening The agreement brings our manufacturing and production expertise to a new and growing segment of the adult treatment market one that provides new treatment choices to consumers and new business opportunities to Invisalign providers Beginning October 2016 we became SDCs exclusive thirdparty supplier for its minor tooth movement aligner program Specifically we provide a case setup through SDCs SmileCheck viewer portal and upon review and approval by a participating licensed orthodontist or general dentist in SDCs network we manufacture clear aligners and ship them directly to SDC SDC aligners include up to 20 stages without attachments or interproximal reduction IPR We manufacture the aligners per SDCs specifications for minor tooth movement using EX30 aligner material The Invisalign brand and system of clear aligners continue to be available exclusively for in office treatment with Invisaligntrained orthodontists and general dentists In addition under the agreement Align and SDC created a new Invisalign doctor referral program similar to the Invisalign Doc Locator that systematically refers the approximately 30 of SDCs SmileCheck case assessments that are too complex for their minor tooth movement product to Invisalign providers in the patients local area The goal of the agreement is to help expand the market and opportunity for our Invisalign doctors while supporting SDCs efforts to provide consumers with access to more choices in treating simple cases from the convenience of their own home Manufacturing and Suppliers Our manufacturing facilities are located in Juarez Mexico where we conduct our aligner fabrication distribute and repair our scanners and perform our CADCAM services and in Or Yehuda Israel where we produce our handheld intraoral scanner wand The final assembly of our iTero scanner is performed by a third party manufacturer located in Israel Our Invisalign digital treatment planning and interpretation for iTero restorative cases are conducted primarily at our facility located in San Jose Costa Rica Information regarding risks associated with our manufacturing process and foreign operations may be found in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10K under the heading Risk Factors Our quality system is required to be in compliance with the Quality System regulations enforced by the FDA and similar regulations enforced by other worldwide regulatory authorities We are certified to EN ISO 134852003 an internationally recognized standard for medical device manufacturing We have a formal documented quality system by which quality objectives are defined understood and achieved Systems processes and procedures are implemented to ensure high levels of product and service quality We monitor the effectiveness of the quality system based on internal data and direct customer feedback and strive to continually improve our systems and processes taking corrective action as needed Since the manufacturing process of our products requires substantial and varied technical expertise we believe that our manufacturing capabilities are important to our success In order to produce our highly customized highly precise medical quality products in volume we have developed a number of proprietary processes and technologies These technologies include complex software algorithms and solutions CT scanning stereolithography and automated aligner fabrication To increase the efficiency of our manufacturing processes we continue to focus our efforts on software development and the improvement of ratelimiting processes or bottlenecks We continuously upgrade our proprietary threedimensional treatment planning software to enhance computer analysis of treatment data and to reduce time spent on manual and judgmental tasks for each case thereby increasing the efficiency of our technicians in Costa Rica In addition to improve efficiency and increase the scale of our operations we continue to invest in the development of automated systems for the fabrication and packaging of aligners We are highly dependent on manufacturers of specialized scanning equipment rapid prototyping machines resin and other advanced materials for our aligners as well as the optics electronic and other mechanical components of our intraoral scanners We 9 maintain single supply relationships for many of these machines and materials technologies In particular our CT scanning and stereolithography equipment used in our aligner manufacturing and many of the critical components for the optics of our intraoral scanners are provided by single suppliers We are also committed to purchasing all of our resin and polymer the primary raw materials used in our manufacturing process for clear aligners from a single source The need to replace one of our single source suppliers could cause a disruption in our ability to timely deliver certain of our products or increase costs See Item 1A Risk Factors  We maintain single supply relationships for certain of our key machines and materials technologies and our business and operating results could be harmed if supply is restricted or ends or the price of raw materials used in our manufacturing process increases Sales and Marketing Our sales efforts are focused primarily on the Invisalign System and continuing to increase adoption and utilization by orthodontists and GPs worldwide In North America Europe and certain Asia Pacific country markets and more recently in Brazil and certain regions in the Middle East and Africa we have direct sales and support organizations which includes quota carrying sales representatives sales management and sales administration We also have distribution partners that sell the Invisalign System in smaller noncore country markets outside of North America We continued to expand in our existing markets through targeted investments in sales coverage professional marketing and education programs along with consumer marketing in selected country markets For the iTero scanner we have a small team of direct sales representatives in North America Our intraoral scanner sales team leverages leads generated by our Invisalign sales and marketing resources including customer events and industry tradeshows We sell the iTero scanner in select country markets internationally and will expand to additional markets over time to grow the scanner business We provide training marketing and clinical support to orthodontists and GPs In 2016  we had approximately 54480 active Invisalign providers Research and Development We are committed to investing in worldclass technology development which we believe is critical to achieving our goal of establishing the Invisalign System as the standard method for treating malocclusion and our intraoral scanning platform as the preferred scanning protocol for digital scans Our research and development expenses were 757 million  612 million and 528 million for the year ended December 31 2016  2015 and 2014  respectively Our research and development activities are directed toward developing the technology innovations that we believe will deliver our next generation of products and platforms These activities range from accelerating product and clinical innovation to developing manufacturing process improvements to researching future technologies and products In an effort to demonstrate Invisaligns broad treatment capabilities various clinical case studies and articles have been published that highlight the clinical applicability of Invisalign to malocclusion cases including those of severe complexity We undertake precommercialization trials and testing of our technological improvements to the product and manufacturing process Intellectual Property We believe our intellectual property position represents a substantial business advantage As of December 31 2016  we had issued 425 US patents 370 foreign issued patents and 386 pending global patent applications We continue to pursue further intellectual property protection through US and foreign patent applications and nondisclosure agreements Our issued US patents expire between 2017 and 2035 In addition corresponding foreign patents will start to expire in 2018 When patents expire we lose the protection and competitive advantages they provided to us which could negatively impact our operating results however we continue to pursue further intellectual property protection through US and foreign patent applications and nondisclosure agreements We also seek to protect our software documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws We cannot be certain that patents will be issued as a result of any patent application or that patents that have been issued to us or that may be issued in the future will be found to be valid and enforceable and sufficient to protect our technology or products Our intellectual property rights may not be successfully asserted in the future or may be invalidated circumvented or challenged In addition the laws of various foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as US laws Our inability to protect our proprietary information could harm our business Information regarding risks associated with failing to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights may be found in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10K under the heading Risk Factors 10 Seasonal Fluctuations General economic conditions impact our business and financial results and we experience seasonal trends related to our two operating segments customer channels and the geographic locations that we serve For example European sales of Invisalign treatment are often weaker in the summer months due to our customers and their patients being on holiday In North America summer is typically the busiest season for orthodontists with practices that have a high percentage of adolescent and teenage patients as many parents want to get their teenagers started in treatment before the start of the school year however many GPs are on vacation during this time and therefore tend to start fewer cases For our Scanner segment capital equipment sales are often stronger in the fourth calendar quarter Consequently these seasonal trends have caused and may continue to cause fluctuations in our quarterly results including fluctuations in sequential revenue growth rates Backlog Due to the individualized nature of an Invisalign treatment which is prescribed by a doctor no two cases are alike thus we maintain relatively low levels of backlog The period from which a treatment data package or a case is received until the acceptance of the digital ClinCheck treatment plan is dependent on the dental professionals discretion to modify accept or cancel the treatment plan Therefore we consider the case a firm order to manufacture aligners once the dental professional has approved the ClinCheck treatment plan Our Invisalign backlog consists of ClinCheck treatment plans that have been accepted but not yet shipped Because aligners are shipped shortly after the ClinCheck treatment plan has been accepted we believe that backlog is not a good indicator of future Invisalign sales Our quarterly Invisalign revenues can be impacted by the timing of the ClinCheck treatment plan acceptances and our ability to ship those cases in the same quarter We define our intraoral scanner backlog as orders where payment is reasonably assured and credit and financing is approved but the scanner has not yet shipped Our intraoral scanner backlog as of December 31 2016 was not material Competition We operate in a highly competitive market and we encounter a wide variety of competitors including larger companies or divisions of larger companies with substantial sales marketing research and financial capabilities We also face competition from early stage companies Although the number of competitors varies by segment currently our products compete directly against products manufactured and distributed by various companies both within and outside the US including Danaher Corporation Sirona Dental Systems Inc Dentsply International Inc 3M Company and other private competitors In addition the expiration of certain of our key patents commencing in 2017 may result in additional competition Information regarding risks associated with increased competition may be found in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10K under the heading  Risk Factors  Key competitive factors include  effectiveness of treatment  price  software features  aesthetic appeal of the treatment method  customer support  customer online interface  brand awareness  innovation  distribution network  comfort associated with the treatment method  oral hygiene  ease of use and  dental professionals chair time We believe that our products compare favorably with our competitors products with respect to each of these factors 11 Government Regulation In order for us to market our products we must obtain regulatory authorization and comply with extensive product and quality system regulations both within and outside the US These regulations including the requirements for approvals or clearance and the time required for regulatory review vary from country to country Failure to obtain regulatory approval and to meet all local requirements including language and specific safety standards in any country in which we currently market or plan to market our products could prevent us from marketing products in such countries or subject us to sanctions and fines The approval by government authorities is unpredictable and uncertain and may not be granted on a timely basis if at all Delays in receipt of or a failure to receive such approvals or clearances or the loss of any previously received approvals or clearances could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations Certain of our products are classified as medical devices under the United States Food Drug and Cosmetic Act the FDCA The FDCA requires these products when sold in the US to be safe and effective for their intended use and to comply with the regulations administered by the United States FDA Our products may also be regulated by comparable agencies in nonUS countries in which they are produced or sold In the European Union EU our products are subject to the medical devices laws of the various member states which are based on a Directive of the European Commission Such laws generally regulate the safety of the products in a similar way to the FDA regulations We believe we are in compliance with all FDA federal and state laws and International regulatory requirements that are applicable to our products and manufacturing operations We are also subject to various laws inside and outside the US concerning our relationships with healthcare professionals and government officials price reporting and regulation the promotion sales and marketing of our products and services the importation and exportation of our products the operation of our facilities and distribution of our products As a global company we are subject to varying degrees of government regulation in the various countries in which we do business and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent oversight and enforcement Initiatives sponsored by government agencies legislative bodies and the private sector to limit the growth of healthcare expenses generally are ongoing in markets where we do business It is not possible to predict at this time the longterm impact of such cost containment measures on our future business Our customers are healthcare providers that may be reimbursed by federally funded programs such as Medicaid or a foreign national healthcare program each of which may offer some degree of oversight Many government agencies both domestic and foreign have increased their enforcement activities with respect to healthcare providers and companies in recent years Enforcement actions and associated defense can be expensive and any resulting findings carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties For example the US Federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act went into effect in 2014 which requires public transparency of transfers of value to physicians In addition we must comply with numerous data protection requirements that span from individual state and national laws in the US to multinational requirements in the EU In the US final regulations implementing amendments to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 HIPAA became effective in the latter part of 2013 with the HIPAA Omnibus Rule The EU is currently considering a proposal to enact legislation governing data protection which would transform the current mix of European countries laws to one overarching multinational law Meanwhile the Asia Pacific region has also seen rapid development of privacy laws including in Singapore Hong Kong and Australia We believe we have designed our product and service offerings to be compliant with the requirements of applicable data protection laws and regulations Maintaining systems that are compliant with these laws and regulations is costly and could require complex changes in the way we do business or provide

for the vast majority of our net revenues and any decline in sales of Invisalign treatment for any reason or a decline in average selling prices would adversely affect net revenues gross margin and net income We expect that net revenues from the sale of the Invisalign System primarily Invisalign Full and Invisalign Teen will continue to account for the vast majority of our total net revenues for the foreseeable future Continued and widespread market acceptance of Invisalign by orthodontists GPs and consumers is critical to our future success If orthodontists and GPs experience a reduction in consumer demand for orthodontic services if consumers prove unwilling to adopt Invisalign as rapidly as we anticipate or in the volume that we anticipate if orthodontists or GPs choose to use a competitive product rather than Invisalign or if the average selling price of our product declines our operating results would be harmed Competition in the markets for our products is intense and we expect aggressive competition from existing competitors and other companies that may introduce new technologies in the future Currently our products compete directly against products manufactured and distributed by various companies both within and outside the US Many of these manufacturers including Danaher Corporation Sirona Dental Systems Inc Dentsply International Inc and 3M have substantially greater financial resources and manufacturing and marketing experience than we do In addition as a result of the expiration of certain key patents owned by us commencing in 2017 we expect that these existing competitors as well as new entrants into the clear aligner market will begin offering an orthodontic system more similar to ours in the near future Several of these competitors will likely have greater resources as well as the ability to leverage their existing channels in the dental market to compete directly with us and therefore our share of the clear aligner market could decline which would likely have a material adverse effect on our business results of operation and financial condition In addition corresponding foreign patents will start to expire in 2018 which will likely result in increased competition in some of the markets outside the US large consumer product companies may also enter the orthodontic supply market Furthermore we also face competition for companies that now offer clear aligner therapy directly to the consumer eliminating the need for the consumer to visit a dental office In addition we may also face competition in the future from new companies that may introduce new technologies We may be unable to compete with these competitors and one or more of these competitors may render our technology obsolete or economically unattractive If we are unable to compete effectively with existing products or respond effectively to any products developed by new or existing competitors our business could be harmed Increased competition has resulted in the past and may in the future result in volume discounting and price reductions reduced gross margins reduced profitability and loss of market share and reduce dental professionals efforts and commitment to expand their use of our products any of which could have a material adverse effect on our net revenues volume growth net income and stock price We cannot assure that we will be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors or that competitive pressures will not have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition We are dependent on our international operations which exposes us to foreign operational political and other risks that may harm our business Our key production steps are performed in operations located outside of the US At our facility in San Jose Costa Rica technicians use a sophisticated internally developed computermodeling program to prepare digital treatment plans which are then transmitted electronically to Juarez Mexico These digital files form the basis of the ClinCheck treatment plan and are used to manufacture aligner molds Our order acquisition aligner fabrication and shipping operations are conducted in Juarez Mexico and starting in July 2016 we transitioned order acquisition for EMEA region to our facility in Amsterdam the Netherlands In addition to the research and development efforts conducted in our North America facilities we also carry out research and development in Moscow Russia We also have customercare accounts receivable credit and collections customer event registration and accounts payable organizations located at our facility in San Jose Costa Rica In addition we have operations in Israel where the design and wand assembly and our intraoral scanner are manufactured Our reliance on international operations exposes us to risks and uncertainties that may affect our business or results of operation including  difficulties in hiring and retaining employees generally as well as difficulties in hiring and retaining employees with the necessary skills to perform the more technical aspects of our operations  difficulties in managing international operations including any travel restrictions to or from our facilities located in Russia Israel and other countries  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  increased income taxes and other restrictions and limitations if we were to decide to repatriate any of our foreign cash balances back to the US 15  import and export license requirements and restrictions  controlling production volume and quality of the manufacturing process  political social and economic instability including as a result of increased levels of violence in Juarez Mexico or the Middle East We cannot predict the effect on us of any future armed conflict political instability or violence in these regions In addition some of our employees in Israel are obligated to perform annual reserve duty in the Israeli military and are subject to being called for additional active duty under emergency circumstances We cannot predict the full impact of these conditions on us in the future particularly if emergency circumstances or an escalation in the political situation occurs If many of our employees are called for active duty our operations in Israel and our business may not be able to function at full capacity  acts of terrorism and acts of war  general geopolitical instability and the responses to it such as the possibility of additional sanctions against Russia which continue to bring uncertainty to this region  interruptions and limitations in telecommunication services  product or material transportation delays or disruption including as a result of increased levels of violence acts of terrorism acts of war or health epidemics restricting travel to and from our international locations or as a result of natural disasters such as earthquakes or volcanic eruptions  burdens of complying with a wide variety of local country and regional laws including the risks associated with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local antibribery compliance  trade restrictions and changes in tariffs and  potential adverse tax consequences If any of these risks materialize in the future we could experience production delays and lost or delayed revenue In addition President Donald Trump and his administration have made recent statements regarding the possibility of changing the way in which the international operations of US companies are taxed including through the implementation of a border tax tariff or increase in custom duties on products manufactured in countries outside of the US such as Mexico and imported into the US In the event such taxes tariffs increased custom duties or other measures are implemented they could have a materially adverse effect on our business and or operating results and we may have to consider relocating some of our international operations We earn an increasingly larger portion of our total revenues from international sales and face risks attendant to those operations We earn an increasingly larger portion of our total revenues from international sales generated through our foreign direct and indirect operations Since our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to further penetrate markets outside the US and increase the localization of our products and services we expect to continue to increase our sales and presence outside the US particularly in the highgrowth markets Our international operations are subject to risks that are customarily encountered in nonUS operations including  local political and economic instability  the engagement of activities by our employees contractors partners and agents especially in countries with developing economies that are prohibited by international and local trade and labor laws and other laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act the UK Bribery Act of 2010 and export control laws in spite of our policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws  although it is our intention to indefinitely reinvest earnings outside the US restrictions on the transfer of funds held by our foreign subsidiaries including with respect to restrictions on our ability to repatriate foreign cash to the US at favorable tax rates  fluctuations in currency exchange rates and  increased expense of developing testing and making localized versions of our products 16 Any of these factors either individually or in combination could materially impact our international operations and adversely affect our business as a whole We face risks related to our international sales including the need to obtain necessary foreign regulatory clearance or approvals Outside of North America we currently sell our products in Europe Asia Pacific Latin America and the Middle East and may expand into other countries from time to time For sales of our products outside the US we are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country The time required to obtain clearances or approvals required by other countries may be longer than that required for FDA clearance or approval and requirements for such approvals may differ from FDA requirements We may be unable to obtain regulatory approvals in one or more of the other countries in which we do business or in which we may do business in the future We may also incur significant costs in attempting to obtain and maintain foreign regulatory approvals If we experience delays in receipt of approvals to market our products outside of the US or if we fail to receive these approvals we may be unable to market our products or enhancements in international markets in a timely manner if at all which could materially impact our international operations and adversely affect our business as a whole Demand for our products may not increase as rapidly as we anticipate due to a variety of factors including a weakness in general economic conditions Consumer spending habits are affected by among other things prevailing economic conditions levels of employment salaries and wage rates gas prices consumer confidence and consumer perception of economic conditions A general slowdown in the US economy and certain international economies or an uncertain economic outlook would adversely affect consumer spending habits which may among other things result in a decrease in the number of overall orthodontic case starts reduced patient traffic in dentists offices reduction in consumer spending on higher value procedures or a reduction in the demand for dental services generally each of which would have a material adverse effect on our sales and operating results Weakness in the global economy results in a challenging environment for selling dental technologies and dentists may postpone investments in capital equipment such as intraoral scanners In addition Invisalign treatment which currently accounts for the vast majority of our net revenues represents a significant change from traditional orthodontic treatment and customers and consumers may be reluctant to accept it or may not find it preferable to traditional treatment We have generally received positive feedback from orthodontists GPs and consumers regarding Invisalign treatment as both an alternative to braces and as a clinical method for the treatment of malocclusion but a number of dental professionals believe that the Invisalign treatment is appropriate for only a limited percentage of their patients Increased market acceptance of all of our products will depend in part upon the recommendations of dental professionals as well as other factors including effectiveness safety ease of use reliability aesthetics and price compared to competing products The frequency of use of the Invisalign system by orthodontists or GPs may not increase at the rate that we anticipate or at all One of our key objectives is to continue to increase utilization or the adoption and frequency of use of the Invisalign System by new and existing customers If utilization of the Invisalign System by our existing and newly trained orthodontists or GPs does not occur or does not occur as quickly as we anticipate our operating results could be harmed We may experience declines in average selling prices of our products which may decrease our net revenues We provide volume based discount programs to our doctors In addition we sell a number of products at different list prices If we introduce any price reductions or consumer rebate programs if we expand our discount programs in the future or participation in these programs increases or if our product mix shifts to lower priced products or products that have a higher percentage of deferred revenue our average selling prices would be adversely affected and our net revenues gross profit gross margin and net income may be reduced In July 2015 we launched a new product policy called Additional Aligners at No Charge that addresses one of our customers top complaints With this product policy change we no longer distinguish between midcourse correction and case refinements and allow doctors to order additional aligners to address either treatment need at no charge subject to certain requirements Based on this product policy beginning in the third quarter of 2015 we deferred more revenue as a result of providing free additional aligners for eligible treatments Additionally as we grandfathered over 1 million open cases we will recognize lower revenues as additional aligners are shipped for at least the following two years until these cases complete We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations Although the US dollar is our reporting currency a portion of our net revenues and net income are generated in foreign currencies Net revenues and net income generated by subsidiaries operating outside of the US are translated into US dollars 17 using exchange rates effective during the respective period and are affected by changes in exchange rates As a result negative movements in currency exchange rates against the US dollar will adversely affect our net revenues and net income in our consolidated financial statements The exchange rate between the US dollar and foreign currencies has fluctuated substantially in recent years and may continue to fluctuate substantially in the future We have in the past and may in the future enter into currency hedging transactions in an effort to cover some of our exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations These transactions may not operate to fully or effectively hedge our exposure to currency fluctuations and under certain circumstances these transactions could have an adverse effect on our financial condition As we continue to grow we are subject to growth related risks including risks related to excess or constrained capacity at our existing facilities We are subject to growth related risks including excess or constrained capacity and pressure on our internal systems and personnel In order to manage current operations and future growth effectively we will need to continue to implement and improve our operational financial and management information systems and to hire train motivate manage and retain employees We may be unable to manage such growth effectively Any such failure could have a material adverse impact on our business operations and prospects In the near term we intend to establish additional order acquisition and treatment planning facilities closer to our international customers in order to improve our operational efficiency and provide doctors with a better experience to further improve their confidence in using Invisalign to treat more patients more often Our ability to plan construct and equip additional order acquisition treatment planning and manufacturing facilities is subject to significant risk and uncertainty including risks inherent in the establishment of a facility such as hiring and retaining employees and delays and cost overruns as a result of a number of factors any of which may be out of our control If the transition into this additional facility is significantly delayed or demand for our product exceeds our current expectations we may not be able to fulfill orders timely which may negatively impact our financial results and overall business In addition because we cannot immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to changing market conditions our facility capacity may at times exceed or fall short of our production requirements In addition if product demand decreases or we fail to forecast demand accurately we could be required to write off inventory or record excess capacity charges which would lower our gross margin Production of our intraoral scanners may also be limited by capacity constraints due to a variety of factors including our dependency on third party vendors for key components in addition to limited production yields Any or all of these problems could result in the loss of customers provide an opportunity for competing products to gain market acceptance and otherwise harm our business and financial results If we fail to sustain or increase profitability or revenue growth in future periods the market price for our common stock may decline If we are to sustain or increase profitability in future periods we will need to continue to increase our net revenues while controlling our expenses Because our business is evolving it is difficult to predict our future operating results or levels of growth and we have not in the past and may not in the future be able to sustain our historical growth rates If we do not increase profitability or revenue growth or otherwise meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors the market price of our common stock will likely decline Our financial results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future which may cause volatility in our stock price Our operating results have fluctuated in the past and we expect our future quarterly and annual operating results to fluctuate as we focus on increasing doctor and consumer demand for our products These fluctuations could cause our stock price to decline or significantly fluctuate Some of the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include  limited visibility into and difficulty predicting the level of activity in our customers practices from quarter to quarter  weakness in consumer spending as a result of the slowdown in the US economy and global economies  changes in relationships with our distributors  changes in the timing of receipt of Invisalign case product orders during a given quarter which given our cycle time and the delay between case receipts and case shipments could have an impact on which quarter revenue can be recognized  fluctuations in currency exchange rates against the US dollar  changes in product mix  our inability to scale production of our iTero Element scanner to meet customer demand  if participation in our customer rebate or discount programs increases our average selling price will be adversely affected 18  seasonal fluctuations in the number of doctors in their offices and their availability to take appointments  success of or changes to our marketing programs from quarter to quarter  our reliance on our contract manufacturers for the production of subassemblies for our intraoral scanners  timing of industry tradeshows  changes in the timing of when revenue is recognized including as a result of the introduction of new products or promotions modifications to our terms and conditions or as a result of changes to critical accounting estimates or new accounting pronouncements  changes to our effective tax rate  unanticipated delays in production caused by insufficient capacity or availability of raw materials  any disruptions in the manufacturing process including unexpected turnover in the labor force or the introduction of new production processes power outages or natural or other disasters beyond our control  the development and marketing of directly competitive products by existing and new competitors  disruptions to our business as a result of our agreement to manufacture clear aligners for SmileDirectClub LLC SDC including market acceptance of the SDC business model and product possible adverse customer reaction and negative publicity about us and our products  impairments in the value of our strategic investments in SDC and other privately held companies could be material  major changes in available technology or the preferences of customers may cause our current product offerings to become less competitive or obsolete  aggressive price competition from competitors  costs and expenditures in connection with litigation  the timing of new product introductions by us and our competitors as well as customer order deferrals in anticipation of enhancements or new products  unanticipated delays in our receipt of patient records made through an intraoral scanner for any reason  disruptions to our business due to political economic or other social instability including the impact of an epidemic any of which results in changes in consumer spending habits consumers unable or unwilling to visit the orthodontist or general practitioners office as well as any impact on workforce absenteeism  inaccurate forecasting of net revenues production and other operating costs  investments in research and development to develop new products and enhancements  changes in accounting rules and  our ability to successfully hedge against a portion of our foreign currencydenominated assets and liabilities To respond to these and other factors we may need to make business decisions that could adversely affect our operating results such as modifications to our pricing policy business structure or operations Most of our expenses such as employee compensation and lease payment obligations are relatively fixed in the short term Moreover our expense levels are based in part on our expectations regarding future revenue levels As a result if our net revenues for a particular period fall below our expectations whether caused by changes in consumer spending consumer preferences weakness in the US or global economies changes in customer behavior related to advertising and prescribing our product or other factors we may be unable to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any shortfall in net revenues Due to these and other factors we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful You should not rely on our results for any one quarter as an indication of our future performance 19 Our future success may depend on our ability to develop successfully introduce and achieve market acceptance of new products Our future success may depend on our ability to develop manufacture market and obtain regulatory approval or clearance of new products There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop sell and achieve market acceptance of these and other new products and applications and enhanced versions of our existing product or software The extent of and rate at which market acceptance and penetration are achieved by future products is a function of many variables which include among other things our ability to  correctly identify customer needs and preferences and predict future needs and preferences  include functionality and features that address customer requirements  ensure compatibility of our computer operating systems and hardware configurations with those of our customers  allocate our research and development funding to products with higher growth prospects  anticipate and respond to our competitors development of new products and technological innovations  differentiate our offerings from our competitors offerings  innovate and develop new technologies and applications  the availability of thirdparty reimbursement of procedures using our products  obtain adequate intellectual property rights and  encourage customers to adopt new technologies If we fail to accurately predict customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenue Even if we successfully innovate and develop new products and produce enhancements we may incur substantial costs in doing so and our profitability may suffer In addition even if our new products are successfully introduced it is unlikely that they will rapidly gain market share and acceptance primarily due to the relatively long period of time it takes to successfully treat a patient with Invisalign Since it takes approximately 12 to 24 months to treat a patient our customers may be unwilling to rapidly adopt our new products until they successfully complete at least one case or until more historical clinical results are available Our ability to market and sell new products may also be subject to government regulation including approval or clearance by the FDA and foreign government agencies Any failure in our ability to successfully develop and introduce or achieve market acceptance of our new products or enhanced versions of existing products could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and could cause our net revenues to decline A disruption in the operations of our primary freight carrier or higher shipping costs could cause a decline in our net revenues or a reduction in our earnings We are dependent on commercial freight carriers primarily UPS to deliver our products to our customers If the operations of these carriers are disrupted for any reason we may be unable to deliver our products to our customers on a timely basis If we cannot deliver our products in an efficient and timely manner our customers may reduce their orders from us and our net revenues and operating profits could materially decline In a rising fuel cost environment our freight costs will increase If freight costs materially increase and we are unable to pass that increase along to our customers for any reason or otherwise offset such increases in our cost of net revenues our gross margin and financial results could be adversely affected If we are unable to accurately predict our volume growth and fail to hire a sufficient number of technicians in advance of such demand the delivery time of our products could be delayed which could adversely affect our results of operations Treatment planning is a key step leading to our manufacturing process which relies on sophisticated computer technology requiring new technicians to undergo a relatively long training process Training production technicians takes approximately 90 to 120 days As a result if we are unable to accurately predict our volume growth we may not have a sufficient number of trained technicians to deliver our products within the timeframe our customers expect Such a delay could cause us to lose existing customers or fail to attract new customers This could cause a decline in our net revenues and net income and could adversely affect our results of operations 20 Our headquarters digital dental modeling processes and other manufacturing processes are principally located in regions that are subject to earthquakes and other natural disasters Our digital dental modeling is processed in our facility located in San Jose Costa Rica The operations team in Costa Rica creates ClinCheck treatment plans using sophisticated computer software In addition our customer facing operations are located in Costa Rica Our aligner molds and finished aligners are fabricated in Juarez Mexico Both locations in Costa Rica and Mexico are in earthquake zones and may be subject to other natural disasters If there is a major earthquake or any other natural disaster in a region where one of these facilities is located our ability to create ClinCheck treatment plans respond to customer inquiries or manufacture and ship our aligners could be compromised which could result in our customers experiencing a significant delay in receiving their completed aligners and a decrease in service levels for a period of time In addition our corporate headquarters facility in California is located in the San Francisco Bay Area An earthquake or other natural disaster in this region could result in a disruption in our operations Any such business interruption could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations Our information technology systems are critical to our business System integration and implementation issues and system security risks could disrupt our operations which could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results We rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems All information technology systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources As our business has grown in size and complexity the growth has placed and will continue to place significant demands on our information technology systems To effectively manage this growth our information systems and applications require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology evolving industry and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences We are in a multiyear companywide program to transform certain business processes or extend established processes which includes the transition to a new enterprise resource planning ERP software system We implemented the first phase of our ERP on July 1 2016 and while we believe we are past any potential significant business disruption we are still monitoring and troubleshooting potential issues The implementation of additional functionality in the ERP system entails certain risks including difficulties with changes in business processes that could disrupt our operations such as our ability to track orders and timely ship products manage our supply chain and aggregate financial and operational data Additionally this implementation may not achieve the anticipated benefits and may divert managements attention from other operational activities negatively affect employee morale or have other unintended consequences Additionally if we are not able to accurately forecast expenses related to the project this may have an adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results If the information we rely upon to run our businesses were to be found to be inaccurate or unreliable if we fail to properly maintain our information systems and data integrity or if we fail to develop new capabilities to meet our business needs in a timely manner we could have operational disruptions have customer disputes lose our ability to produce timely and accurate reports have regulatory or other legal problems have increases in operating and administrative expenses lose existing customers have difficulty in attracting new customers or in implementing our growth strategies or suffer other adverse consequences In addition experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security or our cloudbased software servers hosted by third party and misappropriate our confidential information or that of third parties create system disruptions or cause shutdowns Furthermore sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we either internally develop or procure from third parties which we depend upon may contain defects in design and manufacture including bugs and other problems that can unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system The costs to eliminate or alleviate security problems viruses and bugs could be significant and the efforts to address these problems could result in interruptions that may have a material adverse impact on our operations net revenues and operating results System upgrades and enhancements require significant expenditures and allocation of valuable employee resources Delays in integration or disruptions to our business from implementation of these new or upgraded systems could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results Additionally we continuously upgrade our customer facing software applications specifically the ClinCheck and MyAligntech software Software applications frequently contain errors or defects especially when they are first introduced or when new versions are released The discovery of a defect or error or the incompatibility with the computer operating system and hardware configurations of customers in a new upgraded version or the failure of our primary information systems may result in the following consequences among others loss of revenue or delay in market acceptance damage to our reputation or increased service costs any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations Furthermore our business requires the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks Because of the confidential health information we store and transmit security breaches could expose us to a risk of regulatory action litigation 21 possible liability and loss Our security measures may be inadequate to prevent security breaches and our business operations and profitability would be adversely affected by among other things loss of customers and potential criminal and civil sanctions if they are not prevented There can be no assurance that our process of improving existing systems developing new systems to support our expanding operations integrating new systems protecting confidential patient information and improving service levels will not be delayed or that additional systems issues will not arise in the future Failure to adequately protect and maintain the integrity of our information systems and data may result in a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows If the security of our customer and patient information is compromised patient care could suffer and we could be liable for related damages and our reputation could be impaired We retain confidential customer and patient information in our processing centers Therefore it is critical that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure and that our facilities and infrastructure are perceived by the marketplace and our customers to be secure Despite the implementation of security measures our infrastructure may be vulnerable to physical breakins computer viruses programming errors attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems If we fail to meet our clients expectations regarding the security of healthcare information we could be liable for damages and our reputation could be impaired In addition patient care could suffer and we could be liable if our systems fail to deliver correct information in a timely manner Our insurance may not protect us from this risk Our success depends in part on our proprietary technology and if we are unable to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights our competitive position may be harmed Litigating claims of this type is costly and could distract our management and cause a decline in our results of operations and stock price Our success will depend in part on our ability to maintain existing intellectual property and to obtain and maintain further intellectual property protection for our products both in the US and in other countries Our inability to do so could harm our competitive position As of December 31 2016  we had issued 425 US patents 370 foreign issued patents and 386 pending global patent applications We intend to rely on our portfolio of issued and pending patent applications in the US and in other countries to protect a large part of our intellectual property and our competitive position however our currently pending or future patent filings may not result in the issuance of patents Additionally any patents issued to us may be challenged invalidated held unenforceable circumvented or may not be sufficiently broad to prevent third parties from producing competing products similar in design to our products In addition any protection afforded by foreign patents may be more limited than that provided under US patents and intellectual property laws We also rely on protection of our copyrights trade secrets knowhow and proprietary information We generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants and our collaborative partners upon commencement of a relationship with us however these agreements may not provide meaningful protection against the unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or other confidential information and adequate remedies may not exist if unauthorized use or disclosure were to occur Our inability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology through patents copyrights or trade secrets would impair our competitive advantages and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and future growth prospects In particular a failure to protect our proprietary rights might allow competitors to copy our technology which could adversely affect our pricing and market share In addition in an effort to protect our intellectual property we have in the past been and may in the future be involved in litigation The potential effects on our business operations resulting from litigation that we may participate in the future whether or not ultimately determined in our favor or settled by us are costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from normal business operations Litigation interferences oppositions inter partes reviews or other proceedings are have been and may in the future be necessary in some instances to determine the validity and scope of certain of our proprietary rights and in other instances to determine the validity scope or noninfringement of certain patent rights claimed by third parties to be pertinent to the manufacture use or sale of our products Litigation interference oppositions inter partes reviews administrative challenges or other similar types of proceedings are unpredictable and may be protracted expensive and distracting to management The outcome of such proceedings could adversely affect the validity and scope of our patent or other proprietary rights hinder our ability to manufacture and market our products require us to seek a license for the infringed product or technology or result in the assessment of significant monetary damages An unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or in cases where injunctive relief is sought an injunction prohibiting us from selling our products Any of these results from our litigation could adversely affect our results of operations and stock price 22 While we believe we currently have adequate internal control over financial reporting we are required to assess our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis and any future adverse results from such assessment could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price Pursuant to the SarbanesOxley Act of 2002 and the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC we are required to furnish in our Form 10K a report by our management regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting The report includes among other things an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective This assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management While we believe our internal control over financial reporting is currently effective the effectiveness of our internal controls in future periods is subject to the risk that our controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions including our transition to a new ERP software system and as a result the degree of compliance of our internal control over financial reporting with the existing policies or procedures may become ineffective Establishing testing and maintaining an effective system of internal control over financial reporting requires significant resources and time commitments on the part of our management and our finance staff may require additional staffing and infrastructure investments and would increase our costs of doing business If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective in any future period or if our auditors are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls or conclude that our internal controls are ineffective we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which could have an adverse effect on our stock price If we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain key personnel we may be unable to pursue business opportunities or develop our products We are highly dependent on the key employees in our clinical engineering technology development sales training and marketing personnel and management teams The loss of the services provided by those individuals may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our product development and other business objectives and could harm our business Our future success will also depend on our ability to identify recruit train and retain additional qualified personnel including orthodontists Few orthodontists are accustomed to working in a manufacturing environment since they are generally trained to work in private practices universities and other research institutions Thus we may be unable to attract and retain personnel with the advanced qualifications necessary for the further development of our business Furthermore we may not be successful in retaining our key personnel or their services If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our business could be materially harmed If we infringe the patents or proprietary rights of other parties or are subject to a patent infringement claim our ability to grow our business may be severely limited Extensive litigation over patents and other intellectual property rights is common in the medical device industry We have been sued for infringement of third partys patents in the past and we may be the subject of patent or other litigation in the future From time to time we have received and may in the future receive letters from third parties drawing our attention to their patent rights While we do not believe that we infringe upon any valid and enforceable rights that have been brought to our attention there may be other more pertinent rights of which we are presently unaware The defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings could result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion of effort by our technical and management personnel An adverse determination of any litigation or interference proceeding to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liabilities An adverse determination of this nature could also put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly or require us to seek licenses from third parties Licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all in which event our business would be materially adversely affected 23 We maintain single supply relationships for certain of our key machines and materials technologies and our business and operating results could be harmed if supply is restricted or ends or the price of raw materials used in our manufacturing process increases We are highly dependent on manufacturers of specialized scanning equipment rapid prototyping machines resin and other advanced materials as well as the optics electronic and other mechanical components of our intraoral scanners We maintain single supply relationships for many of these machines and materials technologies In particular our CT scanning and stereolithography equipment used in our aligner manufacturing and many of the critical components for the optics of our scanners are provided by single suppliers We are also committed to purchasing the vast majority of our resin and polymer the primary raw materials used in our manufacturing process for clear aligners from a single source If these or other suppliers encounter financial operating or other difficulties or if our relationship with them changes we might not be able to quickly establish or qualify replacement sources of supply and could face production interruptions delays and inefficiencies In addition technology changes by our vendors could disrupt access to required manufacturing capacity or require expensive time consuming development efforts to adapt and integrate new equipment or processes Our growth may exceed the capacity of one or more of these manufacturers to produce the needed equipment and materials in sufficient quantities to support our growth Conversely in order to secure supplies for production of products we sometimes enter into noncancelable purchase commitments with vendors which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to reflect declining market demands If demand for our products is less than we expect we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges and our profitability may suffer In the event of technology changes delivery delays or shortages of or increases in price for these items our business and growth prospects may be harmed We depend on a single contract manufacturer and supplier of parts used in our iTero scanner and any disruption in this relationship may cause us to fail to meet the demands of our customers and damage our customer relationships We rely on a third party manufacturer to supply key subassemblies for our iTero Element scanner As a result if this third party manufacturer fails to deliver its components if we lose its services or if we fail to negotiate acceptable terms we may be unable to deliver our products in a timely manner and our business may be harmed Any difficulties encountered by the third party manufacturer with respect to hiring personnel and maintaining acceptable manufacturing standards controls procedures and policies could disrupt our ability to deliver our products in a timely manner Finding a substitute manufacturer may be expensive timeconsuming or impossible and could result in a significant interruption in the supply of our intraoral scanning products Any failure by our contract manufacturer that results in delays in our fulfillment of customer orders may cause us to lose revenues and suffer damage to our customer relationships We primarily rely on our direct sales force to sell our products and any failure to maintain our direct sales force could harm our business Our ability to sell our products and generate revenues primarily depends upon our direct sales force within our North American and international markets We do not have any longterm employment contracts with the members of our direct sales force The loss of the services provided by these key personnel may harm our business If we are unable to retain our direct sales force personnel or replace them with individuals of equivalent technical expertise and qualifications or if we are unable to successfully instill such technical expertise or if we fail to establish and maintain strong relationships with our customers within a relatively short period of time our net revenues and our ability to maintain market share could be materially harmed In addition due to our large and fragmented customer base we may not be able to provide all of our customers with product support immediately upon the launch of a new product As a result adoption of new products by our customers may be slower than anticipated and our ability to grow market share and increase our net revenues may be harmed If our distributor relationships are not successful our ability to market and sell our products would be harmed and our financial performance will be adversely affected We depend on relationships with distributors for the marketing and sales of our products in various geographic regions and we have a limited ability to influence their efforts Relying on distributors for our sales and marketing could harm our business for various reasons including 24  agreements with distributors may terminate prematurely due to disagreements or may result in litigation between the partners  we may not be able to renew existing distributor agreements on acceptable terms  our distributors may not devote sufficient resources to the sale of products  our distributors may be unsuccessful in marketing our products  our existing relationships with distributors may preclude us from entering into additional future arrangements with other distributors and  we may not be able to negotiate future distributor agreements on acceptable terms Complying with regulations enforced by the FDA and other regulatory authorities is an expensive and timeconsuming process and any failure to comply could result in substantial penalties Our products are considered medical devices and are subject to extensive regulation in the US and internationally FDA regulations are wide ranging and govern among other things  product design development manufacturing and testing  product labeling  product storage  premarket clearance or approval  complaint handling and corrective actions  advertising and promotion and  product sales and distribution Our failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in enforcement action by the FDA or state agencies which may include any of the following sanctions  warning letters fines injunctions consent decrees and civil penalties  repair replacement refunds recall or seizure of our products  operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production  refusing our requests for 510k clearance or premarket approval of new products new intended uses or modifications to existing products  withdrawing clearance or premarket approvals that have already been granted and  criminal prosecution If any of these events were to occur they could harm our business We must comply with facility registration and product listing requirements of the FDA and adhere to applicable Quality System regulations The FDA enforces its Quality System regulations through periodic unannounced inspections Our failure to take satisfactory corrective action in response to an adverse inspection or the failure to comply with applicable manufacturing regulations could result in enforcement action and we may be required to find alternative manufacturers which could be a long and costly process Any FDA enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us Before we can sell a new medical device in the US or market a new use of or claim for an existing product we must obtain FDA clearance or approval unless an exemption applies Obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals can be a lengthy and timeconsuming process Even though the devices we market have obtained the necessary clearances from the FDA we may be unable to maintain such clearances in the future Furthermore we may be unable to obtain the necessary clearances for new devices that 25 we intend to market in the future Our inability to maintain or obtain regulatory clearances or approvals could materially harm our business In addition as part of the DoddFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act the SEC adopted disclosure requirements regarding the use of certain minerals known as conflict minerals which are mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries as well as procedures regarding a manufacturers efforts to identify and discourage the sourcing of such minerals and metals produced from those minerals Additional reporting obligations are being proposed by the European Union The US requirements and any additional requirements in Europe could affect the sourcing and availability of metals used in the manufacture of a limited number of parts if any contained in our products For example the implementation of these disclosure requirements may decrease the number of suppliers capable of supplying our needs for certain metals thereby negatively affecting our ability to obtain products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices Our material sourcing is broad based and multitiered and we may be unable to conclusively verify the origins for all metals used in our products We may suffer financial and reputational harm if customers require and we are unable to deliver certification that our products are conflict free Regardless we will incur additional costs associated with compliance with these disclosure requirements including timeconsuming and costly efforts to determine the source of any conflict minerals used in our products If compliance with healthcare regulations becomes costly and difficult for our customers or for us we may not be able to grow our business Participants in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive and frequently changing regulations under numerous laws administered by governmental entities at the federal state and local levels some of which are and others of which may be applicable to our business In response to perceived increases in health care costs in recent years Congress passed health care reform legislation that was signed into law in March 2010 This legislation contains many provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions The most relevant of these provisions are those that impose fees or taxes on certain healthrelated industries including medical device manufacturers Furthermore our healthcare provider customers are also subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations that could affect the nature and scope of their relationships with us The healthcare market itself is highly regulated and subject to changing political economic and regulatory influences Regulations implemented pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act HIPAA including regulations affecting the security and privacy of patient healthcare information held by healthcare providers and their business associates may require us to make significant and unplanned enhancements of software applications or services result in delays or cancellations of orders or result in the revocation of endorsement of our products and services by healthcare participants The effect of HIPAA and newly enforced regulations on our business is difficult to predict and there can be no assurance that we will adequately address the business risks created by HIPAA and its implementation or that we will be able to take advantage of any resulting business opportunities Extensive and changing government regulation of the healthcare industry may be expensive to comply with and exposes us to the risk of substantial government penalties In addition to medical device laws and regulations numerous state and federal healthcarerelated laws regulate our business covering areas such as  storage transmission and disclosure of medical information and healthcare records  prohibitions against the offer payment or receipt of remuneration to induce referrals to entities providing healthcare services or goods or to induce the order purchase or recommendation of our products and  the marketing and advertising of our products Complying with these laws and regulations could be expensive and timeconsuming and could increase our operating costs or reduce or eliminate certain of our sales and marketing activities or our revenues Our business exposes us to potential product liability claims and we may incur substantial expenses if we are subject to product liability claims or litigation Medical devices involve an inherent risk of product liability claims and associated adverse publicity We may be held liable if any product we develop or any product that uses or incorporates any of our technologies causes injury or is otherwise found unsuitable Although we intend to continue to maintain product liability insurance adequate insurance may not be available on acceptable terms if at all and may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities A product liability claim regardless 26 of its merit or eventual outcome could result in significant legal defense costs These costs would have the effect of increasing our expenses and diverting managements attention away from the operation of our business and could harm our business Historically the market price for our common stock has been volatile The market price of our common stock could be subject to wide price fluctuations in response to various factors many of which are beyond our control The factors include  quarterly variations in our results of operations and liquidity  changes in recommendations by the investment community or in their estimates of our net revenues or operating results  speculation in the press or investment community concerning our business and results of operations  strategic actions by our competitors such as product announcements or acquisitions  announcements of technological innovations or new products by us our customers or competitors and  general economic market conditions In addition the stock market in general and the market for technology and medical device companies in particular have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated to or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies These broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance Historically class action litigation is often brought against an issuing company following periods of volatility in the market price of a companys securities Future sales of significant amounts of our common stock may depress our stock price A large percentage of our outstanding common stock is currently owned by a small number of significant stockholders These stockholders have sold in the past and may sell in the future large amounts of common stock over relatively short periods of time Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market by our existing stockholders may adversely affect the market price of our common stock Such sales could create public perception of difficulties or problems with our business and may depress our stock price We are subject to risks associated with our strategic investments Impairments in the value of our investments could negatively impact our financial results We have invested in SmileDirectClub LLC SDC and other privately held companies for strategic reasons and to support key business initiatives and we may not realize a return on our strategic investments Many of such companies generate net losses and the market for their products services or technologies may be slow to develop Further valuations of privately held companies are inherently complex due to the lack of readily available market data If we determine that our investments in SDC or other privately held companies have experienced a decline in value we may be required to record impairments which could be material and could have an adverse impact on our financial results If our goodwill or longlived assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings Under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States US GAAP we review our goodwill and longlived asset group for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable Additionally goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually The qualitative and quantitative analysis used to test goodwill are dependent upon various assumptions and reflect managements best estimates Changes in certain assumptions including revenue growth rates discount rates earnings multiples and future cash flows may cause a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of goodwill or the asset group may be impaired We may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in the financial statements during the period in which any impairment of goodwill or asset group are determined Changes in or interpretations of accounting rules and regulations could result in unfavorable accounting charges We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP These principles are subject to interpretation by the SEC and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies A change in these policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even retroactively affect previously reported transactions Our accounting 27 policies that recently have been or may be affected by changes in the accounting rules relate to stockbased compensation revenue recognition and leases If we fail to manage our exposure to global financial and securities market risk successfully our operating results and financial statements could be materially impacted The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal To achieve this objective a majority of our marketable investments are investment grade liquid fixedincome securities and money market instruments denominated in US dollars If the carrying value of our investments exceeds the fair value and the decline in fair value is deemed to be otherthantemporary we will be required to write down the value of our investments which could materially harm our results of operations and financial condition Moreover the performance of certain securities in our investment portfolio correlates with the credit condition of the US financial sector In a current unstable credit environment we might incur significant realized unrealized or impairment losses associated with these investments On July 1 2016 we changed our corporate structure however if we are unable to maintain this structure or if it is challenged by US or foreign tax authorities we may be unable to realize tax savings which could materially and adversely affect our operating results We implemented a new international corporate structure on July 1 2016 This corporate structure may reduce our overall effective tax rate over time through changes in the structure of our international procurement and sales operations as well as realignment of the ownership and use of intellectual property among our whollyowned subsidiaries The structure includes legal entities located in jurisdictions with income tax rates lower than the US federal statutory tax rate Such intercompany arrangements would be designed to result in income earned by such entities in accordance with armslength principles and commensurate with functions performed risks assumed and ownership of valuable corporate assets We believe that income taxed in certain foreign jurisdictions at a lower rate relative to the US federal statutory rate will have a beneficial impact on our worldwide effective tax rate over the medium to long term If the structure is challenged by US or foreign tax authorities if changes in domestic and international tax laws negatively impact the structure including proposed legislation to reform US taxation of international business activities or if we do not operate our business in a manner consistent with the structure and applicable regulatory provisions we may fail to achieve the financial and operational efficiencies that we anticipate as a result of the structure and our business financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected Our effective tax rate may vary significantly from period to period Various internal and external factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our future effective tax rate These factors include but are not limited to changes in tax laws regulations andor rates new or changes to accounting pronouncements nondeductible goodwill impairments changing interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations changes in the relative proportions of revenues and income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates the future levels of tax benefits of stockbased compensation settlement of income tax audits and changes in overall levels of pretax earnings In addition our tax rate may be impacted by tax holidays or incentives In June 2009 the Costa Rica Ministry of Foreign Trade an agency of the Government of Costa Rica granted a twelve year extension of certain income tax incentives which were previously granted in 2002 The incentive tax rates will expire in various years beginning in 2017 We intend to seek a renewal of these income tax incentives before they expire Under these incentives all of the income in Costa Rica during these twelve year incentive periods is subject to a reduced tax rate In order to receive the benefit of these incentives we must hire specified numbers of employees and maintain certain minimum levels of fixed asset investment in Costa Rica If we do not fulfill these conditions for any reason our incentive could lapse and our income in Costa Rica would be subject to taxation at higher rates which could have a negative impact on our operating results The Costa Rica corporate income tax rate that would apply absent the incentives is 30 for 2016  2015 and 2014 As a result of these incentives income taxes were reduced by 191 million  327 million and 325 million in the year ended December 31 2016  2015 and 2014  respectively The benefit of the tax holiday on diluted net income per share was 023 in the year ended December 31 2016 and 040 in each of the year ended December 31 2015 and 2014 Our subsidiary in Israel is under audit by the local tax authorities for calendar years 2006 through 2013 28 Changes in tax laws or tax rulings could negatively impact our income tax provision and net income As a US multinational corporation we are subject to changing tax laws both within and outside of the US Changes in tax laws or tax rulings or changes in interpretations of existing tax laws could affect our income tax provision and net income or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business Many countries in Europe as well as a number of other countries and organizations have recently proposed or recommended changes to existing tax laws or have enacted new laws For example the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD has been working on a Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project which is focused on a number of issues including the shifting of profits between affiliated entities in different tax jurisdictions The OECD issued in 2015 and is expected to continue to issue guidelines and proposals that may change various aspects of the existing framework under which our tax obligations are determined in many of the countries in which we do business In addition the current US administration and key members of Congress have made public statements indicating that tax reform is a priority Certain changes to US tax laws including limitations on the ability to defer US taxation on earnings outside of the United States until those earnings are repatriated to the United States could affect the tax treatment of our foreign earnings ITEM 1B UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None ITEM 2 PROPERTIES We occupy several leased and owned facilities with total office and manufacturing area of over 987000 square feet At December

Act 345 Police  Fire Retirement System filed a lawsuit against Align Thomas M Prescott Mr Prescott Aligns former President and Chief Executive Officer and Kenneth B Arola Mr Arola Aligns former Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of our common stock the Securities Action On July 11 2013 an amended complaint was filed which named the same defendants on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of our common stock between January 31 2012 and October 17 2012 The amended complaint alleged that Align Mr Prescott and Mr Arola violated Section 10b of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b5 promulgated thereunder and that Mr Prescott and Mr Arola violated Section 20a of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Specifically the amended complaint alleged that during the purported class period defendants failed to take an appropriate goodwill impairment charge related to the April 29 2011 acquisition of Cadent Holdings Inc in the fourth quarter of 2011 the first quarter of 2012 or the second quarter of 2012 which rendered our financial statements and projections of future earnings materially false and misleading and in violation of US GAAP The amended complaint sought monetary damages in an unspecified amount costs and attorneys fees On December 9 2013 the court granted defendants motion to dismiss with leave for plaintiff to file a second amended complaint Plaintiff filed a second amended complaint on January 8 2014 on behalf of the same purported class The second amended complaint states the same claims as the amended complaint On August 22 2014 the court granted our motion to dismiss without leave to amend On September 22 2014 Plaintiff filed a notice of appeal to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals Briefing for the appeal was completed in May 2015 and the Ninth Circuit held oral arguments in October 2016 Align intends to vigorously defend itself against these allegations Align is currently unable to predict the outcome of this amended complaint and therefore cannot determine the likelihood of loss nor estimate a range of possible loss if any Shareholder Derivative Lawsuit On February 1 2013 plaintiff Gary Udis filed a shareholder derivative lawsuit against several of Aligns current and former officers and directors in the Superior Court of California County of Santa Clara The complaint alleges that our reported income and earnings were materially overstated because of a failure to timely write down goodwill related to the April 29 2011 acquisition of Cadent Holdings Inc and that defendants made allegedly false statements concerning our forecasts The complaint asserts various state law causes of action including claims of breach of fiduciary duty unjust enrichment and insider trading among others The complaint seeks unspecified damages on behalf of Align which is named solely as nominal defendant against whom no recovery is sought The complaint also seeks an order directing Align to reform and improve its corporate governance and internal procedures and seeks restitution in an unspecified amount costs and attorneys fees On July 8 2013 an Order was entered staying this derivative lawsuit until an initial ruling on our first motion to dismiss the Securities Action On January 15 2014 an Order was entered staying this derivative lawsuit until an initial ruling on our second motion to dismiss the Securities Action On October 14 2014 an Order was entered staying this derivative lawsuit until a ruling by the Ninth Circuit in the Securities Action discussed above Align is currently unable to predict the outcome of this complaint and therefore cannot determine the likelihood of loss nor estimate a range of possible losses if any In addition in the course of Aligns operations Align is involved in a variety of claims suits investigations and proceedings including actions with respect to intellectual property claims patent infringement claims government investigations labor and employment claims breach of contract claims tax and other matters Regardless of the outcome these proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of defense costs diversion of management resources and other factors Although the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict and Aligns view of these matters may change in the future as litigation and events related thereto unfold Align currently does not believe that these matters individually or in the aggregate will materially affect Aligns financial position results of operations or cash flows ITEM 4 MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES Not applicable 30 PART II
