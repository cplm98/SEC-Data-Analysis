Carolina USA our European Middle East and Africa EMEA regional headquarters is located in Rotkreuz Switzerland which moved from Amsterdam the Netherlands in January 2020 and our Asia Pacific APAC regional headquarters is located in Singapore We have two operating segments 1 Clear Aligner and 2 Scanners and Services Scanner For the year ended December 31 2019 Clear Aligner net revenues represented approximately 84 of worldwide net revenues while Scanner net revenues represented the remaining 16 of worldwide net revenues We sell the majority of our products directly to our customers orthodontists and general practitioner dentists GPs as well as to restorative and aesthetic dentists including prosthodontists periodontists and oral surgeons We also sell through sales agents and distributors in certain countries In addition we sell directly to Dental Support Organizations DSOs who contract with dental practices to provide critical business management and support including nonclinical operations and we sell directly to dental laboratories who manufacture or customize a variety of products used by licensed dentists to provide oral health care We received 510k clearance from the United States Food and Drug Administration FDA to market the Invisalign System in 1998 The Invisalign System is regulated by the FDA as a Class II medical device In order to provide Invisalign treatment to their patients orthodontists and GPs must initially complete an Invisalign training course The Invisalign System is sold primarily through a direct sales force in North America APAC Europe EMEA and Latin America LATAM To date over 8 million people worldwide have been treated with our Invisalign System Our iTero scanner is used by dental professionals andor labs and service providers for restorative and orthodontic digital procedures as well as Invisalign case submission We received 510k clearance from the FDA to market iTero software for expanded indications in 2013 Scanners and computeraided designcomputeraided manufacturing CADCAM services are primarily 3 sold through our direct sales force and through sales agents and distributors in certain countries In addition we sell iTero scanners and CADCAM services directly to DSOs Clear Aligner Segment Malocclusion and Traditional Orthodontic Treatment Malocclusion or the misalignment of teeth is one of the most prevalent clinical dental conditions affecting billions of people or approximately 60 to 75 of the global population Annually approximately 12 million people in major developed countries elect treatment by orthodontists worldwide Most orthodontic patients are treated with the use of traditional methods such as metal arch wires and brackets referred to as braces and may be augmented with elastics metal expanders headgear or functional appliances and other ancillary devices as needed Upon completion of the treatment the dental professional may at his or her discretion have the patient use a retainer appliance Of the 12 million annual orthodontic cases started we estimate that approximately 75 or 84 million could be treated using our Invisalign clear aligners In addition approximately 300 million people with malocclusion could benefit from straightening their teeth This represents an incremental opportunity for us as we expand the market for orthodontics by educating more consumers about the benefits of straighter teeth using Invisalign clear aligners and connecting them with an Invisalign doctor of their choice The Invisalign System The Invisalign System is a proprietary method for treating malocclusion based on a proprietary computersimulated virtual treatment plan and a series of doctorprescribed custom manufactured clear plastic removable aligners The Invisalign System offers a range of treatment options specialized services and access to proprietary software for treatment visualization and is comprised of the following phases Orthodontic diagnosis and transmission of treatment data to us  The Invisaligntrained dental professional prepares an online prescription form on our Invisalign Doctor Site and submits the patients records which include a digital intraoral scan or a polyvinylsiloxane PVS impression of the relevant dental arches photographs of the patient and at the dental professionals election xrays of the patients dentition Intraoral digital scans may be submitted through either Aligns iTero scanner or certain thirdparty scanners capable of accurately interfacing with our systems and processes See Third Party Scanners and Digital scans for Invisalign treatment submission More than 73 of Invisalign case submissions are now submitted via digital scan increasing the accuracy of treatments reducing the time from prescription submission to patient receipt and decreasing the carbon footprint resulting from the shipment of the materials used to form the physical PVS impressions and shipping those PVS impressions to us Preparation of computersimulated treatment plan  Using the information and digital data provided we generate a proposed custom threedimensional treatment plan called a ClinCheck treatment plan using our proprietary software which is not for sale or license A patients ClinCheck treatment plan simulates expected tooth movement in stages and details the timing and placement of any features or attachments to be used during treatment Attachments are toothcolored buttons that are sometimes used to increase the biomechanical force on a specific tooth or teeth in order to effect the desired movements Review and approval of the treatment plan by an Invisaligntrained doctor The patients ClinCheck treatment plan is then made available to the prescribing dental professional via the Invisalign Doctor Site which enables the dental professional to project tooth movement from initial position to final position and compare multiple treatment plan options By reviewing modifying as needed and approving the treatment plan the dental professional retains control of the patients treatment Manufacture of custom aligners Upon the dental professionals approval of the ClinCheck treatment plan we use the data underlying the simulation in conjunction with stereolithography technology a form of 3D printing technology to construct a series of molds depicting the future position of the patients teeth Each mold is a replica of the patients teeth at each stage of the simulated course of treatment From these molds aligners are fabricated by pressureforming polymeric sheets over each mold Aligners are thin clear plastic removable dental appliances that are custom manufactured in a series to correspond to each stage of the patients ClinCheck treatment plan Shipment to the dental professional and patient aligner wear In most countries all the aligners for a patients treatment plan are shipped directly to the dental professional who then dispenses them to the patient at regular checkup intervals throughout the treatment Aligners are generally worn for a period of time typically one to two weeks corresponding to the stages of the patients approved ClinCheck treatment plan The patient replaces the aligners with the next pair in the series when prescribed advancing tooth movement through each stage At various points in each patients treatment their doctor may place attachments or use other auxiliaries to achieve desired tooth movements per the doctors original prescription and the approved ClinCheck treatment plan 4 At the treating doctors discretion weekly aligner changes are recommended for all Invisalign treatments except for Invisalign Lite and Express packages and may provide up to 50 shorter treatment time compared with twoweek aligner wear Feature Enhancements We continue to introduce enhanced features across the Invisalign System to improve treatment outcomes or address broader clinical indications For example in 2018 we extended the Invisalign product family with Invisalign First clear aligners designed with features specifically for younger patients with early mixed dentition with a mixture of primarybaby and permanent teeth Invisalign First clear aligners are designed specifically to address a broad range of younger patients malocclusions including shorter clinical crowns management of erupting dentition and predictable dental arch expansion In 2018 we also introduced enhancements designed to improve dental professional and patient experiences and clinical outcomes including wing overlap and engagement in deep bite cases with anterior intrusion new options for mandibular advancement and symmetrical advancement of the left and right side a new default protocol for incremental advancement and improvements to support leveling the curve of Spee in deep bite cases Clear Aligner Products Malocclusion Very Mild Moderate Severe Product Invisalign Express Package Invisalign Lite Package Invisalign Go Limited

patients treatment is not tracking against the original treatment plan The number of additional aligner orders and timing are subject to certain requirements noted in our terms and conditions Comprehensive Products  Invisalign Treatment Options Invisalign Comprehensive  The Invisalign Comprehensive Package is used to treat adults and teens for a full spectrum of mild to severe malocclusion and contains a wide variety of Invisalign features to address the doctors treatment goals It also addresses the orthodontic needs of teenage patients such as Mandibular Advancement compliance indicators and compensation for tooth eruption Invisalign First Phase 1 and Invisalign First Comprehensive Phase 2 Package  Invisalign First Phase 1 is designed specifically for younger patients generally between the ages of seven and ten years which is a mixture of primarybaby and permanent teeth Invisalign First Phase 1 treatment provides early interceptive orthodontic treatment traditionally done through arch expanders or partial metal braces before all permanent teeth have erupted Invisalign First clear aligners are designed specifically to address a broad range of younger patients malocclusions including shorter clinical crowns management of erupting dentition and predictable dental arch expansion Our Invisalign First Comprehensive Phase 2 Package is a continuation of the First Phase 1 and is generally consistent with our Invisalign Comprehensive Package After a patient completes Invisalign First Phase I doctors have the option to purchase a discounted Comprehensive Phase 2 Package for that same patient NonComprehensive Products  Invisalign Treatment Options Invisalign Noncomprehensive Products We offer a variety of lower priced treatment packages for less complex orthodontic cases noncomprehensive relapse cases or straightening prior to restorative or cosmetic treatments such as veneers These packages may be offered in select countries andor may differ from region to region 5 Invisalign Go We also offer Invisalign Go a streamlined NonComprehensive package designed for GPs to more easily identify and treat patients with mild malocclusion The Invisalign Go package includes case assessment support a simplified ClinCheck treatment plan and a progress assessment feature for case monitoring NonCase Products Clear Aligner noncase products include retention products Invisalign training fees and sales of ancillary products such as cleaning material and adjusting tools used by dental professionals during the course of treatment Retention  We offer up to four sets of custom clear aligners called Vivera Retainers made with proprietary material strong enough to maintain tooth position and correct minor relapse if necessary Vivera Retainers are available to both Invisalign and nonInvisalign patients In select markets we also offer single arch retainers SmartTrack Aligner Material SmartTrack is a patented customengineered Invisalign clear aligner material that delivers gentle more constant force considered ideal for orthodontic tooth movements Conventional aligner materials relax and lose a substantial percent of energy in the initial days of aligner wear but SmartTrack maintains more constant force over the period of time the patient wears the aligners The flexible SmartTrack material also more precisely conforms to tooth morphology attachments and interproximal spaces to improve control of tooth movement throughout treatment Scanner Segment Intraoral scanning continues to be an evolving technology that we believe will have a substantial impact on the future of dentistry By enabling the dental practitioner to create a 3D image of a patients teeth digital scan using a handheld intraoral scanner digital scanning is faster more efficient precise and comfortable for patients compared to the discomfort and subjective nature of taking physical impressions The accuracy of digitally scanned models substantially reduces the rate of restoration remakes meaning patients are recalled less often and the appointment time for the restoration is shorter because of fewer adjustments increasing overall patient satisfaction Digital models also reduce the carbon footprint associated with the shipping of the materials used to create PVS impressions the shipping of those impressions and their disposal Moreover the digital model file can be used for various procedures and services including fabrication of physical dental models for use by labs to create restorative units such as veneers inlays onlays crowns bridges and implant abutments digital records storage orthodontic diagnosis orthodontic retainers and appliances and Invisalign digital impression submission iTero Scanner  The iTero Element scanner is available as a single hardware platform with software options for restorative or orthodontic procedures The expanded portfolio includes the iTero Element 2 and the iTero Element Flex scanners which are each available in select regions and countries These products build on the existing high precision fullcolor imaging and fast scan times of the iTero Element portfolio while streamlining orthodontic and restorative workflows We also continue to offer the existing iTero Element scanner in existing markets The iTero scanner is interoperable with our Invisalign treatment such that a full arch digital scan can be submitted as part of the Invisalign case submission process In February 2019 we launched the iTero Element 5D Imaging system which provides a new comprehensive approach to clinical applications workflows and user experience that expands the suite of existing highprecision fullcolor imagining and fast scan times of the iTero Element portfolio In addition to offering all of the features and functionality that doctors have come to expect and rely on with the iTero Element 2 scanner the iTero Element 5D scanner is the first integrated dental imaging system that simultaneously records 3D intraoral color and nearinfrared NIRI imaging and enables comparison over time using iTero TimeLapse NIRI technology of the iTero Element 5D Imaging System aids in detection and monitoring of interproximal caries lesions above the gingiva without using harmful radiation The iTero Element 5D Imaging System is available in the majority of EMEA and select APAC countries however it is pending regulatory approval in the US and LATAM countries In June 2019 we announced the launch of iTero Element Foundation intraoral scanner with restorative software The iTero Element Foundation extends our portfolio of intraoral scanners with powerful 3D visualization to better meet the needs of doctors labs and patients The iTero Element Foundation is available in North America and Japan and will be available in other select APAC and EMEA countries in 2020 Restorative software for iTero Our Restorative software is designed for GPs prosthodontists periodontists and oral surgeons which includes restorative workflows providing them with the ability to send digital impressions to the lab of choice and communicate seamlessly with external treatment planning custom implant abutment chairside milling and laboratory CADCAM systems 6 Orthodontic software for iTero Software designed for orthodontists for digital records storage orthodontic diagnosis and for the fabrication of printed models and retainers CADCAM Services and Ancillary Products Ancillary Products  We sell disposable sleeves for the wand and other ancillary products for the iTero scanner iTero Models and Dies An accurate physical model and dies are manufactured based on the digital scan and sent to the laboratory of the dentists choice for completion of the needed restoration The laboratory also has the option to export the digital file for immediate production of coping and fullcontour restorations on their laboratory CADCAM systems The laboratory conducts then completes the ceramic buildup or staining and glazing and delivers the end result  a precisely fitting restoration iTero prosthetics have a nearzero remake rate Third Party Scanners and Digital scans for Invisalign treatment submission  We accept case submissions for our clear aligner products in two ways 1 physical impressions of the patients teeth or 2 intraoral scan of the patients teeth With respect to intraoral scans we accept scans from iTero scanners and certain thirdparty scanners that have interoperability relationship with our systems and processes iTero Applications and Tools Invisalign Outcome Simulator  The Invisalign Outcome Simulator is an exclusive chairside and cloudbased application for the iTero scanner that allows doctors to help patients visualize how their teeth may look at the end of Invisalign treatment This is achieved through a dual view layout that shows a prospective patient an image of hisher own current dentition next to hisher simulated final position after Invisalign treatment Invisalign 3D Assessment tool The Invisalign Progress Assessment tool provides the ability to compare a patients new scan with a specific stage of their ClinCheck treatment plan This allows doctors to visually assess and communicate Invisalign treatment progress with an easy to read colorcoded tooth movement report TimeLapse TimeLapse technology allows doctors or practitioners to compare a patients historic 3D scans to the presentday scan enabling clinicians to identify and measure orthodontic movement tooth wear and gingival recession This highlights areas of diagnostic interest to dental professionals and helps foster a proactive conversation with the patient regarding potential restorative or orthodontic solutions Our iTero Element iTero Element 2 iTero Element Flex and iTero Element 5D scanners include the Invisalign Outcome Simulator Invisalign 3D Assessment tool and Timelapse as well as the orthodontic software andor restorative software The orthodontic or restorative software may also be purchased subsequently for an upgrade fee Additional applications such as the Invisalign Outcome Simulator are not available for sale separately Other proprietary software mentioned in this Annual Report on Form 10K such as ClinCheck and ClinCheck Pro software the Invisalign Doctor Site and feature enhancements are included as part of the Invisalign System and are not sold separately nor do they contribute as individual items to revenues Business Strategy Our goal is to establish the Invisalign System as the standard method for treating malocclusion and our intraoral scanning platform as the preferred scanning protocol for digital scans Our technology and innovations are designed to meet the demands of todays patients with treatment options that are convenient comfortable affordable while helping to improve overall oral health We strive to help our doctors move their practices forward by connecting them with new patients providing digital solutions to help increase practice efficiency and helping them deliver the best possible treatment outcomes and experiences to millions of people around the world We achieve this by continued focus and execution of our strategic growth drivers as follows 1 International Expansion In order to provide the millions of consumers access to a better smile we continue increasing our presence globally by making our products available in more countries We expect to continue expanding our business by investing in resources infrastructure and initiatives that will drive Invisalign treatment growth in our current and new international markets As our core international countries continue to grow in both number of new Invisalign trained doctors and customer utilization we strive to make sure we can support that growth through investments such as headcount clinical support product improvements education and advertising We have transitioned most of our smaller country markets from an indirect to a direct sales model and while we do not expect a material impact from these countries for 7 some time in the near term we will leverage our existing infrastructure in adjacent country markets as we build local sales and support organizations to drive longterm market penetration In addition we are scaling and expanding our operations and facilities to better support our customers across the globe In 2019 we opened a new order acquisition and treatment facility in Wroclaw Poland and a new treatment planning facility in Yokohama Japan to support customers within these regions 2 GP Adoption We want to enable GPs who have access to a large patient base to more easily identify Invisalign cases they can treat monitor patient progress or if needed help refer cases to an orthodontist while providing highquality restorative orthodontic and dental hygiene care In 2019 we continued to commercialize Invisalign Go a simplified and streamlined solution designed for GPs and trained over 3700 new Invisalign Go doctors primarily in EMEA In the EMEA region we segmented sales and marketing for certain country markets into two separate organizations to serve each customer segment orthodontists and GP dentists separately thereby increasing our focus and effectiveness on GP dentists The iTero scanner is an important component to that customer experience and is central to a digital approach as well as overall customer utilization of Invisalign treatment The iTero scanner is optimized for Invisalign treatment with the Invisalign Outcome Simulator Invisalign Progress Assessment tool and TimeLapse technology This highlights areas of diagnostic interest to dental professionals and helps foster a proactive conversation with the patient regarding potential restorative or orthodontic solutions In March 2019 we began a collaboration with Digital Smile Design to deliver dedicated education programs enable simplified streamlined integration of digital endtoend workflows into GPs practices and offer doctors more opportunities to learn about digital tools and treatment planning support In September 2019 we formed a collaboration with Zimmer Biomet Dental to leverage their extensive direct global salesforce and network of dental clinicians and laboratories to help drive further penetration of iTero scanners and services in the growing digital restorative market The collaboration also offers Zimmer Biomet Dental customers access to Invisalign clear aligners through the iTero platform to facilitate a comprehensive interdisciplinary treatment approach 3 Patient Demand  Conversion Our goal is to make Invisalign a highly recognized name brand worldwide by creating awareness for Invisalign treatment among consumers and motivating potential patients to seek Invisalign treatment We accomplish this objective through an integrated consumer marketing strategy that includes television media social networking and event marketing and strategic alliances with professional sports teams as well as educating patients on treatment options and directing them to high volume Invisalign doctors In January 2019 we expanded our Smile Concierge program which educates consumers on the benefits of Invisalign treatment answers their questions and helps them schedule an appointment with an Invisalign doctor The program simultaneously helps doctors better engage with prospective customers through more detailed customer insights Additionally in August 2019 we significantly increased our investment in consumer marketing in the US The US campaign was launched across all key media channels to over 140 million consumers combining a robust paid media strategy across prime broadcast cable and connected TV channels with paid search and social media 4 Orthodontist Utilization We continue to innovate and increase product applicability and predictability to address a wide range of cases from simple to complex thereby enabling doctors to confidently treat teenagers and adults with the Invisalign System Over the last several years we launched Invisalign Comprehensive with Mandibular Advancement and Invisalign First We also continue to make improvements to our Invisalign treatment software ClinCheck Pro designed to deliver an exceptional user experience and increase treatment control to help our doctors achieve their treatment goals Manufacturing and Suppliers We have manufacturing facilities located in Juarez Mexico where we conduct our aligner fabrication distribution repair of our iTero scanners and perform our CADCAM services In the fourth quarter of 2018 we also began fabricating our aligners in Ziyang China our first aligner fabrication facility outside of Juarez Mexico In addition we produce our handheld intraoral scanner wand perform final scanner assembly and repair our scanners at our facilities in Or Yehuda Israel and Ziyang China Our Invisalign digital treatment planning and interpretation for iTero restorative cases are conducted at our facilities located in San Jose Costa Rica Chengdu China Cologne Germany Madrid Spain Wroclaw Poland and Yokohama Japan Information regarding risks associated with our manufacturing process and foreign operations may be found in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10K under the heading Risk Factors Our quality system is required to be in compliance with the Quality System regulations enforced by the FDA and similar regulations enforced by other worldwide regulatory authorities We are certified to EN ISO 134852003 an internationally recognized standard for medical device manufacturing We have a formal documented quality system by which quality objectives are defined understood and achieved Systems processes and procedures are implemented to ensure high levels of product and service quality We monitor the effectiveness of the quality system based on internal data and direct customer feedback and strive to continually improve our systems and processes taking corrective action as needed 8 Since the manufacturing process of our products requires substantial and varied technical expertise we believe that our manufacturing capabilities are important to our success In order to produce our highly customized highly precise medical quality products in volume we have developed a number of proprietary processes and technologies These technologies include complex software algorithms and solutions CT scanning stereolithography and automated aligner fabrication To increase the efficiency of our manufacturing processes we continue to focus our efforts on software development and the improvement of ratelimiting processes or bottlenecks We continuously upgrade our proprietary threedimensional treatment planning software to enhance computer analysis of treatment data and to reduce time spent on manual and judgmental tasks for each case thereby increasing the efficiency of our technicians In addition to improve efficiency and increase the scale of our operations we continue to invest in the development of automated systems for the fabrication and packaging of aligners We are highly dependent on manufacturers of specialized scanning equipment rapid prototyping machines resin and other advanced materials for our aligners as well as the optics electronic and other mechanical components of our intraoral scanners We maintain single supply relationships for many of these machines and materials technologies In particular our CT scanning and stereolithography equipment used in our aligner manufacturing and many of the critical components for the optics of our intraoral scanners are provided by single suppliers We are also committed to purchasing all of our resin and polymer the primary raw materials used in our manufacturing process for clear aligners from a single source The need to replace one of our single source suppliers could cause a disruption in our ability to timely deliver certain of our products or increase costs For a discussion of the risks of our supply and manufacturing operations see Item 1A Risk Factors  Sales and Marketing Our sales efforts are focused on increasing adoption and utilization of the Invisalign System by orthodontists and GPs worldwide and integrating the iTero scanner into the doctors practice The scanner is an important component to the customer experience and is central to a digital approach as well as overall customer utilization of Invisalign treatments In each region we have direct sales and support organizations which include quota carrying sales representatives sales management and sales administration We also have distribution partners in certain markets In the EMEA region we segmented sales and marketing for certain country markets into two separate organizations to serve each customer segment orthodontists and GP dentists separately thereby increasing our focus and effectiveness on GP dentists We continue to expand in existing markets through targeted investments in sales resources professional marketing and education programs along with consumer marketing in select countries We provide training marketing and clinical support to orthodontists and GPs As of December 31 2019  we had approximately 96000 active Invisalign trained doctors which we define as having submitted at least one case in the prior 12 month period Research and Development We are committed to investing in worldclass technology development which we believe is critical to achieving our goal of establishing the Invisalign System as the standard method for treating malocclusion and our intraoral scanning platform as the preferred scanning protocol for digital scans Our research and development activities are directed toward developing the technology innovations that we believe will deliver our next generation of products and platforms These activities range from accelerating product and clinical innovation to developing manufacturing process improvements to researching future technologies and products In an effort to demonstrate the broad treatment capabilities of the Invisalign System various clinical case studies and articles have been published that highlight the clinical applicability of Invisalign to malocclusion cases including those of severe complexity We undertake precommercialization trials and testing of our technological improvements to the product and manufacturing process Intellectual Property We believe our intellectual property portfolio represents a substantial business advantage As of December 31 2019  we had 489 active US patents 462 active foreign patents and 559 pending global patent applications Our active US patents expire between 2020 and 2039 When patents expire we lose the protection and competitive advantages they provided to us which could negatively impact our operating results however we continue to pursue further intellectual property protection through US and foreign patent applications and nondisclosure agreements We also seek to protect our software documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws We cannot be certain that patents will be issued as a result of any patent application or that patents that have been issued to us or that may be issued in the future will remain valid and enforceable or sufficient to protect our technology or products Our intellectual property rights may not be successfully asserted in the future or may be invalidated circumvented or challenged In addition the laws of various foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as US laws Our inability to protect our proprietary information could harm our business Information 9 regarding risks associated with our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights may be found in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10K under the heading Risk Factors Seasonal Fluctuations General economic conditions impact our business and financial results and we experience seasonal trends within our two operating segments customer channels and the geographic locations that we serve Sales of Invisalign treatments are often weaker in Europe during the summer months due to our customers and their patients being on holiday and seasonally higher in China during the third quarter particularly related to increased teen cases Similarly other international holidays like Chinese New Year can also negatively impact our sales in APAC In North America summer is typically the busiest season for orthodontists with practices that have a high percentage of adolescent and teenage patients as many parents want to get their teenagers started in treatment before the start of the school year however many GPs are on vacation during this time and therefore tend to start fewer cases For our Scanner segment capital equipment sales are often stronger in the fourth calendar quarter Consequently these seasonal trends have caused and may continue to cause fluctuations in our quarterly results including fluctuations in sequential revenue growth rates Backlog All Invisalign treatments are individually unique and prescribed by a doctor so no two cases are alike The period from which a treatment data package or a case is received until the acceptance of the digital ClinCheck treatment plan is dependent on the dental professionals discretion to modify accept or cancel the treatment plan Therefore we consider the case a firm order to manufacture aligners once the dental professional has approved the ClinCheck treatment plan Our Invisalign backlog consists of ClinCheck treatment plans that have been accepted but not yet shipped Because aligners are shipped shortly after the ClinCheck treatment plan has been accepted we believe that backlog is not a good indicator of future clear aligner revenues Our quarterly clear aligner revenues can be impacted by the timing of the ClinCheck treatment plan acceptances and our ability to ship those cases in the same quarter We define our iTero scanner backlog as orders where credit and financing are generally approved and payment is reasonably assured but the scanner has not yet shipped Our Invisalign and iTero scanner backlogs as of December 31 2019 were immaterial Competition Currently our products compete directly against traditional metal brackets and wires and increasingly against products manufactured and distributed by various companies both within and outside the US Although the number of competitors varies by segment geography and customer we encounter a wide variety of competitors including new and wellestablished regional competitors in certain foreign markets as well as larger companies or divisions of larger companies with substantial sales marketing research and financial capabilities Due in part to the expiration of certain of our key patents beginning in 2017 we are facing increased competition in the clear aligner market In addition corresponding foreign patents began expiring in 2018 which has increased competition in markets outside the US These competitors include existing larger companies in certain markets who have the ability to leverage their existing channels in the dental market to compete directly with us directtoconsumer DTC companies that provide clear aligners using a remote teledentistry model requiring little or no inoffice care from trained and licensed physicians and doctors themselves who can manufacture custom aligners in their offices using modern 3D printing technology Unlike our DTC competitors we are committed to a doctor as the core of everything we do and Invisalign Treatment requires a doctors prescription and an inperson physical examination of the patients dentition before treatment can begin Information regarding risks associated with increased competition may be found in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10K under the heading  Risk Factors  Key competitive factors include  Our SmartTrack aligner materials  effectiveness of treatment  price  software features  aesthetic appeal of the treatment method  customer support  customer online interface  brand awareness  innovation  distribution network  comfort associated with the treatment method  oral hygiene  ease of use and 10  dental professionals chair time We believe that our products compare favorably with our competitors products with respect to each of these factors Government Regulation Many countries throughout the world have established regulatory framework for commercialization of medical devices As a designer manufacturer and marketer of medical devices we are obligated to comply with the respective framework of these countries to obtain and maintain access to these global markets The framework often defines requirements for premarket authorizations which vary from country to country Failure to obtain appropriate premarket authorization and to meet all local requirements including specific safety standards in any country in which we currently market our products could cause commercial disruption andor subject us to sanctions and fines Delays in receipt of or a failure to receive such premarket authorizations or the loss of any previously received premarket authorizations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations With regards to premarket authorization in the US our products are classified as medical devices under the US Food Drug and Cosmetic Act FDC Act The FDC Act requires these products when sold in the US to be safe and effective for their intended use and to comply with medical device regulations defined by the FDA This regulatory framework is comparable to the framework established in the European Union EU Within the EU our products are subject to the requirements defined by the Medical Device Directive which is generally consistent with FDA regulations We believe we are in compliance with all state federal and international regulatory requirements that are applicable to our products We are also subject to various laws inside and outside the US concerning our relationships with healthcare professionals and government officials price reporting and regulation the promotion sales and marketing of our products and services the importation and exportation of our products the operation of our facilities and distribution of our products As a global company we are subject to varying degrees of government regulation in the various countries in which we do business and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent oversight and enforcement Initiatives sponsored by government agencies legislative bodies and the private sector to limit the growth of healthcare expenses generally are ongoing in markets where we do business It is not possible to predict at this time the longterm impact of such cost containment measures on our future business Our customers are healthcare providers that may be reimbursed by federal funded programs such as Medicaid or a foreign national healthcare program each of which may offer some degree of oversight Many government agencies both domestic and foreign have increased their enforcement activities with respect to healthcare providers and companies in recent years Enforcement actions and associated defense can be expensive and any resulting findings carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties In addition we must comply with numerous data protection requirements that span from individual state and national laws in the US to multinational requirements in the EU In the US final regulations implementing amendments to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 HIPAA became effective in the latter part of 2013 with the HIPAA Omnibus Rule We are also required to be in compliance with the California Consumer Privacy Act CCPA which went into effect in January 2020 In the EU we must comply with the General Data Protection Regulation GDPR which serves as a harmonization of European dataprivacy laws Further expansion into LATAM markets will require us to prepare for Brazils Lei Geral de Proteo de Dados LGPD scheduled to take effect in August 2020 Meanwhile the APAC and EMEA regions have also seen rapid development of privacy laws including India Russia China South Korea Singapore Hong Kong and Australia We believe we have designed our product and service offerings to be compliant with the requirements of applicable data protection laws and regulations Maintaining systems that are compliant with these laws and regulations is costly and could require complex changes in the way we do business or provide services to our customers and their patients Additionally our success may be dependent on the success of healthcare providers in managing data protection requirements Information regarding risks associated with data security and privacy may be found in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10K under the heading  Risk Factors  Employees As of December 31 2019  we had approximately 14530 employees including 9470 in manufacturing and operations 2880 in sales and marketing which includes customer care 800 in research and development and 1380 in general and administrative functions 11 Available Information Our

two sections The first entitled Risks Relating to our Business discusses some of the risks that may affect our business results of operations and financial condition The second captioned Risks Related to our Common Stock discusses some of the risks relating to owning our common stock You should carefully review both sections as well as our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and other information appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10K for important information regarding these and other risks that may affect us The fact we have chosen to list one section before the other or that we have identified risks in either section earlier than others should not be interpreted to mean we deem any risks to be more or less important or more likely to occur than others or if any do occur that their impact may be any less significant than others These risk factors should be considered in connection with evaluating the forwardlooking statements contained in this report because they could cause our actual results and conditions to differ materially from those statements Before you invest in Align you should know that investing involves risks including those described below The risks below are not the only ones we face If any of the risks actually occur our business financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected the trading price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment Risks Relating to our Business Our net revenues are dependent primarily on our Invisalign System and iTero Scanners and any decline in sales or average selling price of these products for any reason would adversely affect net revenues gross margin and net income Our net revenues are largely dependent on the sales of our Invisalign System of clear aligners and iTero intraoral scanners Of the two we expect net revenues from the sale of the Invisalign System primarily our comprehensive products will continue to account for the vast majority of our net revenues for the foreseeable future Continued and widespread acceptance of the Invisalign System by orthodontists GPs and consumers is critical to our future success Our iTero scanners are used by dental professionals for restorative and orthodontic procedures as well as Invisalign System case submissions Sales of our iTero scanners are continuing to grow becoming a larger percentage of our overall revenues and as a means to further adoption of digital dentistry and the Invisalign System If orthodontists and GPs experience a reduction in consumer demand for orthodontic services if consumers prove unwilling to adopt Invisalign System treatment as rapidly or in the volumes we anticipate and at the prices offered if orthodontists or GPs choose to use wires and brackets or competitive products rather than Invisalign if sales of our iTero scanners decline or fail to grow sufficiently or as expected or if the average selling price of our products decline for any reason particularly in the case of our Invisalign System as a result of a shift in product mix towards lower priced products or as a result of promotions or competition our operating results would be harmed Competition in the markets for our products is increasing and we expect aggressive competition from existing competitors and other companies that may introduce new technologies in the future The dental industry is in a period of immense and rapid transformation involving products technologies distribution channels and business models much of which is based on digital transformation involving information technology data artificial intelligence scanning 3D printing software and algorithms While our clear aligner and iTero scanners facilitate this transition there remains significant uncertainty concerning the technologies that will achieve market acceptance and if adopted whether and when they may become obsolete as new offerings become available Currently our clear aligner products compete directly against traditional metal brackets and wires and increasingly against clear aligner products manufactured and distributed by new market entrants as well as traditional manufacturers of wires and brackets both within and outside the US and from traditional medical device companies laboratories startups and in some cases from doctors themselves Although the number and type of competitors varies by segment geography and customer we encounter a wide variety of competitors including new and wellestablished regional competitors in certain foreign markets as well as larger companies or divisions of larger companies with substantial sales marketing research and financial capabilities Due in part to the expiration of certain of our key patents beginning in 2017 we have faced increased competition in the clear aligner market These competitors include existing larger companies in certain markets who have the ability to leverage their existing channels in the dental market to compete directly with us directtoconsumer DTC companies that provide clear aligners using a remote teledentistry model that requires little or no inoffice care from trained and licensed physicians and doctors themselves who can manufacture custom aligners in their offices using modern 3D printing technology In addition corresponding foreign patents began expiring in 2018 which has resulted in increased competition in markets outside the US Large consumer product companies may also enter the orthodontic supply market The manipulation and movement of teeth and bone is a delicate process with potentially painful and debilitating results if not appropriately performed and monitored Accordingly we remain committed to delivering our solutions primarily through trained and skilled doctors Invisalign Treatment requires a doctors prescription and an in person physical examination of the patients dentition before beginning treatment However with the advent of DTC providers accompanied by significant advertising 14 campaigns there has been some shifting away from traditional practices that may impact our primary selling channels We also believe doctors are sampling alternative products andor taking advantage of wires and brackets bundles that essentially give clear aligners away for free or at reduced prices In addition we may also face competition in the future from new companies that may introduce new technologies We may be unable to compete with these competitors or one or more of these competitors may render our technology obsolete or economically unattractive If we are unable to compete effectively with existing products or respond effectively to any new technologies our business could be harmed Increased competition has resulted in the past and may in the future result in volume discounting and price reductions reduced gross margins and profitability loss of market share and result in the reduction of dental professionals efforts and commitment to use our products any of which could materially adversely affect our net revenues volume growth net income and stock price We cannot assure that we will be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors or that competitive pressures will not have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition We are dependent on our international operations which exposes us to foreign operational political and other risks that may harm our business Our key production steps are performed in operations located outside of the US Technicians use a sophisticated internally developed computermodeling program to prepare digital clinical treatment plans ClinCheck which are then transmitted electronically to our aligner fabrication facilities These digital files form the basis of the ClinCheck treatment plan and are used to manufacture aligner molds and aligners Our digital treatment planning and aligner fabrication are performed in multiple international locations and we are continuing to establish these functions closer to our international customers to improve doctor and patient experiences and our operational efficiency Also in addition to research and development efforts conducted in the US Russia and Israel we have operations in Israel and China where we assemble wands and our intraoral scanner is manufactured Our reliance on international operations exposes us to risks and uncertainties that may affect our business or results of operation including  difficulties in hiring and retaining employees generally as well as difficulties in hiring and retaining employees with the necessary skills to perform the more technical aspects of our operations  difficulties in managing international operations including any travel restrictions on us or our customers such as those recently imposed in China in response to the Novel Coronavirus epidemic  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  import and export controls license requirements and restrictions  controlling production volume and quality of the manufacturing process  political social and economic instability including increased levels of violence in Juarez Mexico Hong Kong or the Middle East We cannot predict the effect on us of any future armed conflict political instability or violence in these regions In addition some of our employees in Israel are obligated to perform annual reserve duty in the Israeli military and may be called for additional active duty under emergency circumstances We cannot predict the full impact of these conditions on us particularly if emergency circumstances or an escalation in political situations occur If many of our employees are called for active duty our operations in Israel and our business may not be able to function at full capacity  acts of terrorism and acts of war  general geopolitical instability and the responses to it such as the possibility of sanctions trade restrictions and changes in tariffs including recent sanctions against China and Russia and tariffs imposed by the US and China and the possibility of additional tariffs or other trade restrictions between the US and Mexico  interruptions and limitations in telecommunication services  product or material transportation delays or disruption including as a result of customs clearance violence protests police and military actions or as a result of natural disasters such as earthquakes or volcanic eruptions  burdens of complying with a wide variety of regional and local laws including competition and antibribery laws  the impact of governmentled initiatives to encourage the purchase or support of domestic vendors which can affect the willingness of customers to purchase products from or collaborate to promote interoperability of products with companies whose headquarters or primarily operations are not domestic  unexpected issues and expenses related to our corporate structure reorganization  reduced intellectual property rights protections as compared to the US  longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection and  potential adverse tax consequences The United Kingdoms UK withdrawal from the EU on January 31 2020 commonly known as Brexit has exacerbated and may further exacerbate many of the risks and uncertainties described above The withdrawal of the UK from the EU could among other potential outcomes adversely affect the tax tax treaty currency operational legal and regulatory regimes to which our businesses in the region are subject The withdrawal could also among other potential outcomes disrupt the free movement of goods services and people between the UK and the EU and significantly disrupt trade between the UK and the EU and other parties Further uncertainty around these and related issues could lead to adverse effects on the economy of the UK EU and the 15 other economies in which we operate As the withdrawal continues to unfold the actual implications of Brexit in their entirety are unlikely to be known for years If any of the risks outlined above materialize in the future we could experience production delays and lost or delayed revenues We earn an increasingly larger portion of our total revenues from international sales and face risks attendant to those operations We earn an increasingly larger portion of our total revenues from international sales generated through our foreign direct and indirect operations Since our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to penetrate international markets and increase the localization of our products and services we expect to continue to increase our sales and presence outside the US particularly in markets we believe to have highgrowth potential Our international operations are subject to risks that are customarily encountered in nonUS operations including  local political and economic instability  the engagement of activities by our employees contractors partners and agents especially in countries with developing economies that are prohibited by international and local trade and labor laws and other laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials including the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act the UK Bribery Act of 2010 and export control laws in spite of our policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  increased expense of developing testing and making localized versions of our products and  health pandemics such as the new coronavirus in China and natural disasters including weather and fires such as those common in California and recently in Australia Any of these factors either individually or in combination could materially impact our international operations and adversely affect our business as a whole Demand for our products may not increase as rapidly as we anticipate due to a variety of factors including a weakness in general economic conditions and resistance to nontraditional treatment methods Consumer spending habits are affected by among other things prevailing economic conditions levels of employment salaries and wage rates consumer confidence and consumer perception of economic conditions A general slowdown in the US economy and certain international economies or an uncertain economic outlook would adversely affect consumer spending habits which may among other things result in a decrease in the number of overall orthodontic case starts reduced patient traffic in dentists offices reduction in consumer spending on elective nonurgent or higher value procedures or a reduction in the demand for dental services generally each of which would have a material adverse effect on our sales and operating results Weakness in the global economy results in a challenging environment for selling dental technologies and dentists may postpone investments in capital equipment such as intraoral scanners In addition Invisalign treatment which currently accounts for the vast majority of our net revenues represents a significant change from traditional orthodontic treatment involving metal brackets and wires and customers and consumers may be reluctant to accept it or may not find it costeffective or preferable to traditional treatment We have generally received positive feedback from orthodontists GPs and consumers regarding Invisalign treatment as both an alternative to braces and as a clinical method for the treatment of malocclusion but a number of dental professionals believe that the Invisalign treatment is appropriate for only a limited percentage of their patients Increased market acceptance of all of our products will depend in part upon the recommendations of dental professionals as well as other factors including effectiveness safety ease of use reliability aesthetics and price compared to competing products and treatment methods Our success may depend on our ability to develop successfully introduce and achieve market acceptance of new products or product offerings Our success depends on our ability to profitably develop manufacture market and obtain regulatory approval or clearance of new products and improvements to existing products There is no assurance we can successfully develop sell and achieve market acceptance of new or improved products and services The extent of and rate at which market acceptance and penetration are achieved by new or future products or offerings is a function of many variables which include among other things our ability to  correctly predict timely develop and cost effectively manufacture or bring to market solutions that meet future customer needs and preferences with the features and functionality they desire or expect  allocate our research and development funding to products with higher growth prospects  ensure compatibility of our computer operating systems and hardware configurations with those of our customers  anticipate and rapidly respond to new competitive products product offerings and technological innovations 16  differentiate our products and product offerings from our competitors as well as other products in our own portfolio and successfully articulate the benefits of those differences to our customers  innovate and develop new technologies and applications  the availability of thirdparty reimbursement of procedures using our products  obtain and protect adequate intellectual property rights and  encourage customers to adopt new technologies If we fail to accurately predict customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenues Even if we successfully innovate and develop new products and product enhancements we may incur substantial costs in doing so and our profitability may suffer In addition even if our new products are successfully introduced it may be difficult to gain market share and acceptance particularly if doctors require education to understand the benefits of the new products or measure their success only after extended periods of time required to treat patients For instance it can take up to 24 months or longer to treat patients using our Invisalign System Similarly we recently introduced our mandibular advancement treatment and expect it will require significant time and effort on our part to educate doctors to the benefits of this treatment method Consequently doctors may be unwilling to rapidly adopt our new products until they successfully complete at least one case or until more historical clinical results are available Our ability to market and sell new products may also be subject to government regulation including approval or clearance by the FDA and foreign government agencies Any failure in our ability to successfully develop and introduce or achieve market acceptance of our new products or enhanced versions of existing products could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and could cause our net revenues to decline We may experience declines in average selling prices of our products which may decrease our net revenues We provide volumebased discount programs to our customers In addition we sell a number of products at different list prices which also differ based on regions and or country If we change volumebased discount programs affecting our average selling prices if we introduce any price reductions or consumer rebate programs if we expand our discount programs or participation in these programs increases if our critical accounting estimates materially differ from actual behavior or results or if our geographic channel or product mix shifts to lower priced products or to products that have a higher percentage of deferred revenue our average selling prices would be adversely affected Moreover we may find that some programs are unsuccessful or even if successful may drive demand in unexpected ways Were any of the foregoing to occur our net revenues gross profit gross margin and net income may be reduced We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations Although the US dollar is our reporting currency a growing portion of our net revenues and net income are generated in foreign currencies Net revenues and net income generated by subsidiaries operating outside of the US are translated into US dollars using constantly fluctuating often substantially exchange rates during the respective period As a result negative movements in exchange rates against the US dollar have and may increasingly adversely affect our net revenues and net income in our consolidated financial statements We enter into currency forward contract transactions in an effort to cover some of our exposure to currency fluctuations but there is no assurance these transactions will fully or effectively hedge our exposure to currency fluctuations and under certain circumstances these transactions could have an adverse effect on our financial condition As we continue to grow we are subject to growth related risks including risks related to excess or constrained capacity and operational inefficiencies at our manufacturing and treat facilities We are subject to growth related risks including excess or constrained capacity and pressure on our internal systems and personnel In order to manage current operations and future growth effectively we will need to continue to implement and improve our operational financial and management information systems and to hire train motivate manage and retain employees We may be unable to manage such growth effectively Any such failure could have a material adverse impact on our business operations and prospects We continue to establish additional order acquisition treatment planning and manufacturing facilities closer to our international customers in order to provide doctors with a better experience improve their confidence in using Invisalign to treat more patients more often and provide redundancy should other facilities be temporarily or permanently unavailable Our ability to plan construct and equip additional order acquisition treatment planning and manufacturing facilities is subject to significant risk and uncertainty including risks inherent in the establishment of a facility such as hiring and retaining employees and delays and cost overruns as a result of a number of factors any of which may be out of our control and may negatively impact our gross margin In addition these facilities may be located in higher cost regions compared to Mexico and Costa Rica which may negatively impact our gross margin If the transition into additional facilities is significantly delayed or demand for our products exceeds our current expectations we may be unable to fulfill orders timely which may negatively impact our financial results reputation and 17 overall business In addition because we cannot immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to changing market conditions our facility capacity may at times exceed or fall short of our production requirements If product demand decreases or we fail to forecast demand accurately we could be required to write off inventory or record excess capacity charges which would lower our gross margin Production of our intraoral scanners may also be limited by capacity constraints due to a variety of factors including our dependency on third party vendors for key components in addition to limited production yields Any or all of these problems could result in the loss of customers provide an opportunity for competing products to gain market acceptance and otherwise harm our business and financial results  If we fail to sustain or increase profitability or revenue growth in future periods our profitability may decline If we are to sustain or increase profitability in future periods we need to continue increasing our net revenues while controlling expenses Because our business is evolving it is difficult to predict our future operating results or levels of growth and we have not in the past and may be unable in the future to sustain our historical growth rates which may cause our profitability to decline Our operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future making it difficult to predict the timing and amount of revenues costs and expenditures Our operating results have fluctuated in the past and we expect our future quarterly and annual operating results to fluctuate for a variety of reasons particularly as we focus on increasing doctor and consumer demand for our products Some of the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include  limited visibility into and difficulty predicting from quarter to quarter the level of activity in our customers practices  changes in geographic channel or product mix  weakness in consumer spending as a result of a slowdown in the global US or other economies  higher manufacturing costs  competition in general and competitive developments in the market  changes in relationships with our dental support organizations and distributors including timing of orders  changes in the timing of when revenues are recognized including as a result of the timing of receipt of product orders and shipments the introduction of new products and software releases product offerings or promotions modifications to our terms and conditions or as a result of new accounting pronouncements or changes to critical accounting estimates including without limitation those estimates based on such matters as our predicted usage of additional aligners  fluctuations in currency exchange rates against the US dollar  our inability to scale suspend or reduce production based on variations in product demand  increased participation in our customer rebate or discount programs could adversely affect our average selling prices  seasonal fluctuations including those related to patient demographics such as teen buying habits in China and Europe as well as the number of doctors in their offices and their availability to take appointments  success of or changes to our marketing programs from quarter to quarter  our reliance on our contract manufacturers for the production of subassemblies for our intraoral scanners  increased advertising or marketing efforts or aggressive price competition from competitors  changes to our effective tax rate  unanticipated delays and disruptions in the manufacturing process caused by insufficient capacity or availability of raw materials turnover in the labor force or the introduction of new production processes power outages or natural or other disasters beyond our control  underutilization of manufacturing and treat facilities  major changes in available technology or the preferences of customers may cause our current product offerings to become less competitive or obsolete  costs and expenditures in connection with litigation  costs and expenditures in connection with the establishment of treatment planning and fabrication facilities in international locations  costs and expenditures in connection with hiring and deployment of direct sales force personnel  unanticipated delays in our receipt of patient records made through intraoral scanners for any reason  disruptions to our business due to political economic or other social instability or any governmental regulatory or similar actions including the impact of an epidemic such as recent developments beginning in China in connection with the Novel Coronavirus any of which results in changes in consumer spending habits consumers unable or unwilling to visit the orthodontist or general practitioners office as well as any impact on workforce absenteeism  inaccurate forecasting of net revenues production and other operating costs  investments in research and development to develop new products and enhancements  material impairments in the value of our privately held companies and  timing of industry tradeshows 18 To respond to these and other factors we may make business decisions that adversely affect our operating results such as modifications to our pricing policy promotions development efforts product releases business structure or operations Most of our expenses such as employee compensation and lease payment obligations are relatively fixed in the short term Moreover our expense levels are based in part on our expectations regarding future revenue levels As a result if our net revenues for a particular period fall below expectations we may be unable to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any shortfall in net revenues Due to these and other factors we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful You should not rely on our results for any one quarter as an indication of our future performance A disruption in the operations of our primary freight carrier or higher shipping costs could cause a decline in our net revenues or a reduction in our earnings We are dependent on commercial freight carriers primarily UPS to deliver our products If the operations of these carriers are disrupted for any reason we may be unable to timely deliver our products to our customers If we cannot deliver our products on time and cost effectively our customers may choose competitive offerings or create their own aligners causing our net revenues and gross margins to decline possibly materially In a rising fuel cost environment our freight costs will increase In addition we earn an increasingly larger portion of our total revenues from international sales International sales carry higher shipping costs which could negatively impact our gross margin and results of operations If freight costs materially increase and we are unable to pass that increase along to our customers for any reason or otherwise offset such increases in our cost of net revenues our gross margin and financial results could be adversely affected If we are unable to accurately predict our volume growth and fail to hire a sufficient number of technicians in advance of such demand or hire technicians faster than our actual growth projections the delivery time of our products could be delayed or our costs may exceed our revenues each of which could adversely affect our results of operations Treatment planning is a key step leading to our manufacturing process which relies on sophisticated computer software This requires new technicians to undergo a relatively long training process often up to 120 days or longer As a result if we are unable to accurately predict our volume growth we may have an insufficient number of trained technicians to deliver our products within the time frame our customers expect Such a delay could cause us to lose existing customers or fail to attract new customers This could cause a decline in our net revenues and net income and could adversely affect our results of operations Conversely if we hire and train technicians in anticipation of volume growth that does not materialize or materializes at a rate we do not anticipate our costs and expenditures may outpace our revenue growth harming our gross margins operating expenses and financial results Our information technology systems are critical to our business System integration and implementation issues and system security risks could disrupt our operations which could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results We rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems All information technology systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources As our business has grown in size and complexity the growth has placed and will continue to place significant demands on such systems To effectively manage this growth our information systems and applications require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology evolving industry and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences We are continuing to transform certain business processes extend established processes to new subsidiaries andor implement additional functionality in our enterprise resource planning ERP software system which entails certain risks including difficulties with changes in business processes that could disrupt our operations such as our ability to track orders and timely ship products manage our supply chain and aggregate financial and operational data System upgrades and enhancements require significant expenditures and allocation of valuable employee resources Delays in integration or disruptions to our business from implementation of these new or upgraded systems could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results Additionally we continuously upgrade our customer facing software applications specifically the ClinCheck software MyAligntech and the Invisalign Doctor Site Software applications frequently contain errors or defects especially when they are first introduced or when new versions are released The discovery of a defect or error in our software applications or information systems or incompatibility with customers computer operating systems and hardware configurations with a new release or upgraded version or the failure of our primary information systems may result in the following consequences among others delay or loss of revenues or delay in market acceptance damage to our reputation loss of market share to competition or increased service costs any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations If the information we rely on to run our businesses were to be found to be inaccurate or unreliable if we fail to properly maintain our information systems and data integrity or if we fail to develop new capabilities to meet our business needs in a timely 19 manner we could suffer operational disruptions have customer disputes fail to produce timely and accurate reports have regulatory or other legal problems experience increases in operating and administrative expenses lose existing customers have difficulty in attracting new customers or in implementing our growth strategies or suffer other adverse consequences In addition experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security or our cloudbased software servers hosted by third parties and misappropriate our confidential information or that of third parties create system disruptions or cause shutdowns Furthermore sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we either internally develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design and manufacture including bugs and other problems that can unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system The costs to eliminate or alleviate security problems viruses and bugs could be significant and the efforts to address these problems could result in interruptions that may have a material adverse impact on our operations net revenues and operating results Furthermore our business requires the secure transmission of confidential patient health information over public networks Because we store and transmit sensitive information including protected patient health information security breaches could expose us to a risk of regulatory action litigation possible liability and loss We have experienced breaches in the past and our security measures may be inadequate to prevent future security breaches and our business operations and profitability would be adversely affected by among other things loss of customers and potential criminal and civil sanctions if they are not prevented There can be no assurance that our process of improving existing systems developing new systems to support our expanding operations integrating new systems protecting confidential patient health information and improving service levels will not be delayed or that additional systems issues will not arise in the future Failure to adequately protect and maintain the integrity of our information systems and data may result in a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows If the security of our customer and patient information is compromised or we are unable to comply with data protection laws patient care could suffer and we could be liable for related damages and our reputation could be impaired We retain confidential customer financial as well as patient health information in our processing centers Therefore it is critical that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure and are also perceived by the marketplace and our customers to be secure Despite the implementation of security measures we have experienced breaches in the past and our infrastructure may be vulnerable to physical breakins computer viruses programming errors or other technical malfunctions hacking or phishing attacks by third parties employee error or malfeasance or similar disruptive problems If we fail to meet our customer and patients expectations regarding the security of customer and patient information we could be liable for damages and our reputation and competitive position could be impaired Affected parties could initiate legal or regulatory action against us which could cause us to incur significant expense and liability or result in orders forcing us to modify our business practices Concerns over our privacy practices could adversely affect others perception of us and deter customers advertisers and partners from using our products In addition patient care could suffer and we could be liable if our systems fail to deliver correct information in a timely manner We have cybersecurity insurance related to a breach event covering expenses for notification credit monitoring investigation crisis management public relations and legal advice The policy also provides coverage for regulatory action defense including fines and penalties potential payment card industry fines and penalties and costs related to cyber extortion however damage and claims arising from such incidents may not be covered or may exceed the amount of any coverage We are also subject to federal state and foreign laws and regulations including ones relating to privacy data protection content regulation and consumer protection We may be or become subject to data localization or data residency laws which generally require that certain types of data collected within a country be stored and processed only within that country or approved countries Some countries including Russia and China have enacted and others are considering enacting data localization or data residency laws If countries in which we have customers adopt data localization or data residency laws we could be required to implement new or expand existing data storage protocols build new storage facilities andor devote additional resources to comply with the requirements of such laws any of which could have significant cost implications We may also be subject to data export restrictions or international transfer laws which prohibit or impose conditions upon the transfer of such data from one country to another These laws and regulations are constantly evolving and may be interpreted applied created or amended in a manner that could adversely affect our business In addition we must comply with numerous data protection requirements that span from individual state and national laws in the US to multinational requirements in the EU In the EU we must comply with the General Data Protection Regulation GDPR which serves as a harmonization of European dataprivacy laws We believe we have designed our product and service offerings to be compliant with the requirements of applicable data protection laws and regulations Maintaining systems that are compliant with these laws and regulations is costly and could require complex changes in the way we do business or provide services to our customers and their patients Additionally our success may be dependent on the success of healthcare providers in managing data protection requirements 20 In order to deepen our market penetration and raise awareness of our brand and products we have increased the amount we spend on marketing activities which may not ultimately prove successful or an effective use of our resources To increase awareness of our products and services domestically and internationally we have increased the amount we spend and anticipate spending in the future on marketing activities Our marketing efforts and costs are significant and include national and regional campaigns involving television print media social media and more recently alliances with professional sports teams and other strategic partners We attempt to structure our advertising campaigns in ways we believe most likely to increase brand awareness and adoption however there is no assurance our campaigns will achieve the returns on advertising spend desired or successfully increase brand or product awareness sufficiently to sustain or increase our growth goals which could have an adverse effect on our gross margin and business overall Our success depends in part on our proprietary technology and if we are unable to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights our competitive position may be harmed Litigating claims of this type is costly and could distract our management and cause a decline in our results of operations and stock price Our success depends in part on our ability to maintain existing intellectual property rights and to obtain and maintain further intellectual property protection for our products both in the US and in other countries Our inability to do so could harm our competitive position For further details concerning our patents and other intellectual property please see Intellectual Property in Part I Item 1 Business of this annual report on Form 10K We intend to rely on our portfolio of issued and pending patent applications in the US and in other countries to protect a large part of our intellectual property and our competitive position however our currently pending or future patent filings may not result in the issuance of patents Additionally any patents issued to us may be challenged invalidated held unenforceable circumvented or may not be sufficiently broad to prevent third parties from producing competing products similar in design to our products In addition any protection afforded by foreign patents may be more limited than that provided under US patents and intellectual property laws Certain of our key patents began to expire in 2017 which have resulted in increased competition and less expensive competitive products We also rely on protection of our copyrights trade secrets knowhow and proprietary information We generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants and our collaborative partners upon commencement of a relationship with us however these agreements may not provide meaningful protection against the unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or other confidential information and adequate remedies may not exist if unauthorized use or disclosure were to occur Our inability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology through patents copyrights or trade secrets would impair our competitive advantages and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and future growth prospects In particular a failure to protect our proprietary rights might allow competitors to copy our technology which could adversely affect our pricing and market share In addition in an effort to protect our intellectual property we are currently have in the past been and may in the future be involved in litigation The potential effects on our business operations resulting from litigation that we may participate in the future whether or not ultimately determined in our favor or settled by us are costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from normal business operations Litigation interferences oppositions reexams inter partes reviews post grant reviews or other proceedings are have been and may in the future be necessary in some instances to determine the validity and scope of certain of our proprietary rights and in other instances to determine the validity scope or noninfringement of certain patent rights claimed by third parties to be pertinent to the manufacture use or sale of our products Litigation interference oppositions reexams inter partes reviews post grant reviews administrative challenges or other similar types of proceedings are unpredictable and may be protracted expensive and distracting to management The outcome of such proceedings could adversely affect the validity and scope of our patent or other proprietary rights hinder our ability to manufacture and market our products require us to seek a license for the infringed product or technology or result in the assessment of significant monetary damages An unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or in cases where injunctive relief is sought an injunction prohibiting us from selling our products Any of these results from our litigation could adversely affect our results of operations and stock price Obtaining approvals and complying with regulations enforced by the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities is an expensive and timeconsuming process and any failure to obtain or maintain approvals for our products or services or failure to comply with regulations could materially harm our sales result in substantial penalties and cause harm to our reputation Our products are considered medical devices and are subject to extensive and widely varying regulations in the US and internationally Before we can sell a new medical device in the US or market a new use of or claim for an existing product we must obtain FDA clearance or approval unless an exemption applies Internationally similar requirements apply on a country by country basis In the US FDA regulations are wide ranging and govern among other things  product design development manufacturing and testing 21  product labeling  product storage  premarket clearance or approval  complaint handling and corrective actions  advertising and promotion and  product sales and distribution It takes significant time effort and expense to obtain and maintain FDA approvals of our products and services In other countries the requirements to obtain and maintain similar approvals may differ materially from those of the FDA Moreover there is no guarantee we will successfully obtain or maintain approvals in all or any of the countries in which we do business now or in the future Even if we are successful the time and effort may take significantly longer and costs may be significantly greater If approvals to market our products or services are delayed whether in the US or other countries we may be unable to market our products or services in markets we deem important to our business Were any of these risks to occur our domestic or international operations may be materially harmed and our business as a whole adversely impacted In addition our failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in enforcement actions in the US and other countries For example enforcement actions by the FDA may include any of the following sanctions  warning letters fines injunctions consent decrees and civil penalties  repair replacement refunds recall or seizure of our products  operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production  refusing our requests for 510k clearance or premarket approval of new products new intended uses or modifications to existing products  withdrawing clearance or premarket approvals that have already been granted and  criminal prosecution We must also comply with facility registration and product listing requirements of the FDA and adhere to applicable Quality System regulations The FDA enforces its Quality System regulations through periodic unannounced inspections Our failure to take satisfactory corrective action in response to an adverse inspection or the failure to comply with applicable manufacturing regulations could result in enforcement action and we may be required to find alternative manufacturers which could be a long and costly process Any enforcement action by the FDA or foreign governments could have a material adverse effect on us The sourcing and availability of metals used in the manufacture of a limited number of parts if any contained in our products may be affected by laws and regulations in the US or internationally regarding the use of minerals obtained from certain regions of the world like the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries These laws and regulations may decrease the number of suppliers capable of supplying our needs for certain metals thereby negatively affecting our ability to obtain products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices We may furthermore suffer financial and reputational harm if customers require and we are unable to deliver certification that our products are conflict free Regardless we will incur additional costs associated with compliance with these laws and regulations including timeconsuming and costly efforts to determine the source of any conflict minerals used in our products We are required to annually assess our internal control over financial reporting and any future adverse results from such assessment could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price We have implemented and routinely assess update and refine our internal control over financial reporting for its effectiveness Pursuant to the SarbanesOxley Act of 2002 and the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC we are required to furnish in our Form 10K a report by our management regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting The report includes among other things an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective This assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management Our internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions including changes in personnel updates and upgrades to existing software including our ERP software system changes in accounting standards or interpretations of existing standards and as a result the degree of compliance of our internal control over financial reporting with the existing policies or procedures may become ineffective Establishing testing and maintaining an effective system of internal control over financial reporting requires significant resources and time commitments on the part of our management and our finance staff may require additional staffing and infrastructure investments and increases our costs of doing business If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective in any future period or if our auditors are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls or conclude that our internal controls are ineffective the timely filing of our financial reports could be delayed or we could be required to restate past reports and cause us to lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness 22 of our financial reports in the future which could have an adverse effect on our stock price If we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain key personnel we may be unable to pursue business opportunities or develop our products We are highly dependent on the key employees in our clinical engineering technology development sales training and marketing personnel and management teams The loss of the services provided by those individuals may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our product development and other business objectives and could harm our business Our future success will also depend on our ability to identify recruit train and retain additional qualified personnel including orthodontists and production technicians in our treatment planning facilities Few orthodontists are accustomed to working in a manufacturing environment since they are generally trained to work in private practices universities and other research institutions Thus we may be unable to attract and retain personnel with the advanced qualifications necessary for the further development of our business Furthermore we may not be successful in retaining our key personnel or their services If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our business could be materially harmed If we infringe the patents or proprietary rights of other parties or are subject to a patent infringement claim our ability to grow our business may be severely limited Extensive litigation over patents and other intellectual property rights is common in the medical device industry We have been sued for infringement of third partys patents in the past and we may be the subject of patent or other litigation in the future We periodically receive and may in the future receive letters from third parties drawing our attention to their patent rights While we do not believe we infringe upon any valid and enforceable rights that have been brought to our attention there may be other more pertinent rights of which we are presently unaware The defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings could result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion of effort by our technical and management personnel An adverse determination of any litigation or interference proceeding to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liabilities An adverse determination of this nature could also put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly or require us to seek licenses from third parties Licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all in which event our business would be materially adversely affected We maintain single supply relationships for certain key machines and materials and our business and operating results could be harmed if supply is restricted or ends or the price of raw materials used in our manufacturing process increases We are highly dependent on manufacturers of specialized scanning equipment rapid prototyping machines resin and other advanced materials as well as the optics electronic and other mechanical components of our intraoral scanners We maintain single supply relationships for many of these machines and materials technologies In particular our CT scanning and stereolithography equipment used in our aligner manufacturing and many of the critical components for the optics of our scanners are provided by single suppliers We are also committed to purchasing the vast majority of our resin and polymer the primary raw materials used in our manufacturing process for clear aligners from a single source If these or other suppliers encounter financial operating or other difficulties or if our relationship with them changes we may be unable to quickly establish or qualify replacement sources of supply and could face production interruptions delays and inefficiencies In addition technology changes by our vendors could disrupt access to required manufacturing capacity or require expensive time consuming development efforts to adapt and integrate new equipment or processes Our growth may exceed the capacity of one or more of these manufacturers to produce the needed equipment and materials in sufficient quantities to support our growth Conversely in order to secure supplies for production of products we sometimes enter into noncancelable minimum purchase commitments with vendors which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to reflect declining market demands If demand for our products is less than we expect we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges and our profitability may suffer In the event of technology changes delivery delays or shortages of or increases in price for these items our business and growth prospects may be harmed We depend on a single contract manufacturer and supplier of parts used in our iTero scanner and any disruption in this relationship may cause us to fail to meet the demands of our customers and damage our customer relationships We rely on a thirdparty manufacturer to supply key subassemblies for our iTero Element scanner As a result if this manufacturer fails to deliver its components if we lose its services or if we fail to negotiate or maintain acceptable terms we may be unable to deliver our products in a timely manner and our business may be harmed Furthermore any difficulties encountered by this manufacturer with respect to hiring personnel and maintaining acceptable manufacturing standards controls procedures and policies could disrupt our ability to timely deliver our products Finding a substitute manufacturer may be expensive timeconsuming or impossible and could result in a significant interruption in the supply of our intraoral scanning products Any failure by our contract manufacturer that results in delays in our fulfillment of customer orders may cause us to lose revenues and suffer damage to our customer relationships 23 We primarily rely on our direct sales force to sell our products and any failure to train and maintain our direct sales force could harm our business Our ability to sell our products and generate revenues primarily depends upon our direct sales force within our Americas and International markets We do not have any longterm employment contracts with our direct sales force and the loss of the services provided by these key personnel may harm our business In order to provide more comprehensive sales and service coverage we continue to increase the size of our sales force to pursue growth opportunities within and outside of our existing geographic markets Moreover as we focus on market penetration we have begun to segregate sales personnel to focus on specific markets such as orthodontists and GPs To adequately train new representatives to successfully market and sell our products and for them to establish strong customer relationships can take up to twelve months or more As a result if we are unable to retain our direct sales personnel or quickly replace them with individuals of equivalent technical expertise and qualifications if we are unable to successfully instill technical expertise in new and existing sales representatives if we fail to establish and maintain strong relationships with our customers or if our efforts at specializing our selling techniques do not prove successful and costeffective our net revenues and our ability to maintain market share could be materially harmed In addition due to our large and fragmented customer base we may not be able to provide all of our customers with product support immediately upon the launch of a new product As a result adoption of new products by our customers may be slower than anticipated and our ability to grow market share and increase our net revenues may be harmed As compliance with healthcare regulations becomes more costly and difficult for us or our customers we may be unable to grow our business Participants in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive and frequently changing regulations under numerous laws administered by governmental entities at the federal state and local levels some of which are and others of which may be applicable to our business Furthermore our healthcare provider customers are also subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations that could affect the nature and scope of their relationships with us The healthcare market itself is highly regulated and subject to changing political economic and regulatory influences Regulations implemented pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act HIPAA including regulations affecting the security and privacy of patient healthcare information held by healthcare providers and their business associates may require us to make significant and unplanned enhancements of software applications or services result in delays or cancellations of orders or result in the revocation of endorsement of our products and services by healthcare participants The effect of HIPAA and newly enforced regulations on our business is difficult to predict and there can be no assurance that we will adequately address the business risks created by HIPAA and its implementation or that we will be able to take advantage of any resulting business opportunities Extensive and changing government regulation of the healthcare industry may be expensive to comply with and exposes us to the risk of substantial government penalties In addition to medical device laws and regulations numerous state and federal healthcarerelated laws regulate our business covering areas such as  storage transmission and disclosure of medical information and healthcare records  prohibitions against the offer payment or receipt of remuneration to induce referrals to entities providing healthcare services or goods or to induce the order purchase or recommendation of our products and  the marketing and advertising of our products Complying with these laws and regulations could be expensive and timeconsuming and could increase our operating costs or reduce or eliminate certain of our sales and marketing activities or our revenues Our business exposes us to potential product liability claims and we may incur substantial expenses if we are subject to product liability claims or litigation Medical devices involve an inherent risk of product liability claims and associated adverse publicity We may be held liable if any product we develop or any product that uses or incorporates any of our technologies causes injury or is otherwise found unhealthy or unsuitable Although we intend to continue to maintain product liability insurance adequate insurance may not be available on acceptable terms if at all and may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities A product liability claim regardless of its merit or eventual outcome could result in significant legal defense costs and damage our reputation These costs would have the effect of increasing our expenses and diverting managements attention away from the operation of our business and could harm our business 24 Business disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses Our global operations may be disrupted by natural or human induced disasters including earthquakes tsunamis floods drought hurricanes typhoons wildfires extreme weather conditions power shortages telecommunications failures materials scarcity and price volatility and medical epidemics or health pandemics Climate change may increase both the frequency and severity of natural disasters and consequently risks to our operations and growth The occurrence of business disruptions could harm our growth and expansion result in significant losses seriously harm our revenue profitability and financial condition adversely affect our competitive position increase our costs and expenses and require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations Our digital dental modeling is primarily processed in our facility located in San Jose Costa Rica The operations team in Costa Rica creates ClinCheck treatment plans using sophisticated computer software In addition our customer facing operations are located in Costa Rica Our aligner molds and finished aligners are fabricated in Juarez Mexico and we have and are building additional facilities in China Both locations in Costa Rica and Mexico are in earthquake zones and may be subject to other natural disasters If there is a major earthquake or any other natural disaster in a region where one of these facilities is located our ability to create ClinCheck treatment plans respond to customer inquiries or manufacture and ship our aligners could be compromised which could result in our customers experiencing significant delays receiving their aligners and a decrease in service levels for a period of time Additionally our sales and operations in China have been impacted and are likely to continue to be disrupted as a result of the Novel Coronavirus outbreak Moreover our corporate headquarters and a portion of our research and development activities are located in California which suffers from earthquakes periodic droughts and wildfires affecting the health and safety of our employees Any such business interruptions could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations Changes in or interpretations of accounting rules and regulations could result in unfavorable accounting charges We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the US GAAP These principles are subject to interpretation by the SEC and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies A change in these policies or in the way these policies are interpreted by us or regulators can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even retroactively affect previously reported transactions If we fail to manage our exposure to global financial and securities market risk successfully our operating results and financial statements could be materially impacted The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal To achieve this objective a majority of our marketable investments are investment grade liquid fixedincome securities and money market instruments denominated in US dollars If the carrying value of our investments exceeds the fair value and the decline in fair value is deemed to be otherthantemporary we will be required to write down the value of our investments which could materially harm our results of operations and financial condition Moreover the performance of certain securities in our investment portfolio correlates with the credit condition of the US financial sector In an unstable credit environment we might incur significant realized unrealized or impairment losses associated with these investments If our goodwill or longlived assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings Under GAAP we review our goodwill and longlived asset group for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable Additionally goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually The qualitative and quantitative analysis used to test goodwill are dependent upon various assumptions and reflect managements best estimates Changes in certain assumptions including revenue growth rates discount rates earnings multiples and future cash flows may cause a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of goodwill or the asset group may be impaired We may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in the financial statements during the period in which any impairment of goodwill or asset group are determined We may experience unexpected issues and expenses associated with our corporate structure reorganization including the relocation of our EMEA regional headquarters to Switzerland We reorganized our corporate structure and intercompany relationships in January 2020 in an effort to more closely align our international business activities and to achieve financial and operational efficiencies The implementation of this reorganization plan included the move of our EMEA regional headquarters from the Netherlands to Switzerland has been timeconsuming and costly may be disruptive to our business and following completion of the reorganization plan may not be more efficient or effective This relocation is accompanied by a number of risks and uncertainties that may affect our results of operations and statement of cash flows including 25  failure to retain key employees who possess specific knowledge or expertise and upon whom we are depending upon for the timely and successful transition  difficulties in hiring employees in Switzerland with the necessary skills and expertise and  increased costs as we transition the operations to Switzerland along with higher costs of doing business in Switzerland If any of these risks materialize in the future our operating results statement of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected Our effective tax rate may vary significantly from period to period Various internal and external factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our future effective tax rate These factors include but are not limited to changes in legal entity structure andor activities performed within our entities changes in tax laws regulations andor rates new or changes to accounting pronouncements changing interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations changes in the relative proportions of revenues and income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates changes in overall levels of pretax earnings the future levels of tax benefits of stockbased compensation settlement of income tax audits and nondeductible goodwill impairments For example our effective tax rate will vary significantly in our first quarter of fiscal 2020 due to the relocation of our EMEA regional headquarters from the Netherlands to Switzerland effective January 1 2020 Also we may continue to experience significant variation in our effective tax rate related to excess tax benefits on stockbased compensation particularly in the first quarter of each year when the majority of our equity awards vest Changes in tax laws or tax rulings could negatively impact our income tax provision and net income As a US multinational corporation we are subject to changing tax laws both within and outside of the US Changes in tax laws or tax rulings or changes in interpretations of existing tax laws could affect our income tax provision and net income or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business In addition governmental tax authorities are increasingly scrutinizing the tax positions of companies Many countries in Europe as well as a number of other countries and organizations have recently proposed or recommended changes to existing tax laws or have enacted new laws For example the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD has been working on a Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project which is focused on a number of issues including the shifting of profits between affiliated entities in different tax jurisdictions The OECD has issued and is expected to continue to issue guidelines and proposals that may change various aspects of the existing framework under which our tax obligations are determined in many of the countries in which we do business We are subject to risks associated with our strategic investments Impairments in the value of our investments and unsecured promissory note could negatively impact our financial results We have invested in privately held companies for strategic reasons and to support key business initiatives and we may not realize a return on our strategic investments Many of such companies generate net losses and the market for their products services or technologies may be slow to develop Further valuations of privately held companies are inherently complex due to the lack of readily available market data If we determine that our investments have experienced a decline in value or are determined to be uncollectible we may be required to record impairments which could be material and could have an adverse impact on our financial results Risks Related to our Common Stock Historically the market price for our common stock has been volatile The market price of our common stock could be subject to wide price fluctuations in response to various factors many of which are beyond our control The factors include  quarterly variations in our results of operations and liquidity or changes in our forecasts and guidance  changes in recommendations by the investment community or in their estimates of our net revenues or operating results  speculation in the press or investment community concerning our business and results of operations  announcements by competitors or new market entrants  strategic actions by us or our competitors such as management changes material transactions or acquisitions  announcements regarding stock repurchases sales of our common stock credit agreements and debt issuances  announcements of technological innovations or new products or product offerings by us our customers or competitors  key decisions in pending litigation  sales of stock by us our officers or directors and  general economic market conditions 26 In addition the stock market in general and the market for technology and medical device companies in particular have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated to or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies These broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance Historically class action litigation is often brought against an issuing company following periods of volatility in the market price of a companys securities and we have not been excepted from such litigation We cannot guarantee we will continue to repurchase our common stock and any repurchases may not achieve our objectives We have a history of recurring stock repurchase programs intended to return capital to our investors Any authorization or continuance of our share repurchase programs is contingent on a variety of factors including our financial condition results of operations business requirements and our board of directors continuing determination that share repurchases are in the best interests of our stockholders and in compliance with all applicable laws and agreements There is no assurance that we will continue to repurchase stock consistent with historical levels or at all or that our stock repurchase programs will have a beneficial impact on our stock price Future sales of significant amounts of our common stock may depress our stock price A large percentage of our outstanding common stock is currently owned by a small number of significant stockholders These stockholders have sold in the past and may sell in the future large amounts of common stock over relatively short periods of time Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market by our existing stockholders may adversely affect the market price of our common stock Such sales could create public perception of difficulties or problems with our business and may depress our stock price ITEM 1B UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None ITEM 2 PROPERTIES We occupy several leased and owned facilities At December 31 2019  the significant facilities occupied were as follows
