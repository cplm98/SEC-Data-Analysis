carrying sales agents and distributors in certain countries In addition we sell directly to Dental Support Organizations DSOs who contract with dental practices to provide critical business management and support including nonclinical operations and we sell products used by dental laboratories who manufacture or customize a variety of products used by licensed dentists to provide oral health care We received 510k clearance from the United States Food and Drug Administration FDA to market the Invisalign System in 1998 The Invisalign System is regulated by the FDA as a Class II medical device In order to provide Invisalign treatment to their patients orthodontists and GPs must initially complete an Invisalign training course Our iTero intraoral scanner is used by dental professionals andor labs and service providers for restorative and orthodontic digital procedures as well as Invisalign case submissions We received 510k clearance from the FDA to market iTero software for expanded indications in 2013 Our Systems and Services products are primarily sold through our direct sales force and through noninventory carrying sales agents and distributors in certain countries and directly to DSOs In April 2020 we completed the acquisition of privatelyheld exocad Global Holdings GmbH exocad a German dental CADCAM software company that offers fully integrated workflows to dental labs and dental practices We acquired exocad for its expertise in restorative dentistry implantology guided surgery and smile design to extend the Invisalign System and iTero digital solutions and pave the way for new crossdisciplinary dentistry in labs and at chairside exocad now has over 200 partners and more than 40000 software licenses installed worldwide Clear Aligner Segment Malocclusion and Traditional Orthodontic Treatment Malocclusion or the misalignment of teeth is one of the most prevalent clinical dental conditions affecting billions of people or approximately 60 to 75 of the global population Annually approximately 15 million people in major developed countries elect treatment by orthodontists worldwide Most orthodontic patients are treated with the use of traditional methods such as metal arch wires and brackets referred to as braces and may be augmented with elastics metal expanders headgear or functional appliances and other ancillary devices as needed Upon completion of the treatment the dental professional may at his or her discretion have the patient use a retainer appliance Of the 15 million annual global orthodontic cases started we estimate that approximately 90 or 135 million could be treated using our Invisalign clear aligners In addition globally approximately 500 million people with malocclusion could benefit from straightening their teeth This represents a significant opportunity for us as we expand the market for orthodontics by training more doctors including GP dentists as well as orthodontists and educating more consumers about the benefits of straighter teeth using the Invisalign System and connecting them with an Invisalign doctor of their choice The Invisalign System The Invisalign System is a proprietary method for treating malocclusion based on a proprietary computersimulated virtual treatment plan and a series of doctorprescribed custom manufactured clear polymer removable aligners The Invisalign System offers a range of treatment options specialized services and access to proprietary software for treatment visualization and is comprised of the following phases Diagnosis and transmission of treatment data  An Invisalign System trained dental professional prepares an online prescription form on our Invisalign Doctor Site and submits the patients records which include a digital intraoral scan or a polyvinylsiloxane PVS impression of the relevant dental arches photographs of the patient and at the dental professionals election xrays of the patients dentition Intraoral digital scans may be submitted through Aligns iTero scanner or certain thirdparty scanners capable of accurately interfacing with our systems and processes See Third Party Scanners and Digital scans More than 79 of Invisalign System case submissions are now submitted via digital scan increasing the accuracy of 4 treatments reducing the time from prescription submission to patient receipt and decreasing the carbon footprint resulting from the shipment of the materials used to form PVS impressions to the doctors and shipping those PVS impressions back to us Computersimulated treatment plan  Using the information certain doctor preferences and digital data provided we generate a proposed custom threedimensional treatment plan called a ClinCheck  treatment plan using proprietary software we have developed through significant ongoing investments over more than 20 years A patients ClinCheck treatment plan simulates desired tooth movement in stages and details the timing and placement of any features or attachments to be used during treatment Attachments are toothcolored buttons that are sometimes used to increase the biomechanical force on a specific tooth or teeth in order to affect the desired movements Review and approval of the treatment plan by an Invisalign trained doctor The patients ClinCheck treatment plan is then made available to the prescribing dental professional via Aligns Invisalign Doctor Site which enables the dental professional to evaluate projected tooth movement from initial position to final position and compare multiple treatment plan options By reviewing modifying as needed and approving the treatment plan the dental professional retains control of the patients treatment Manufacture of custom aligners Following the dental professionals approval of the ClinCheck treatment plan we use the data underlying the simulation as input for the next stage in which we use stereolithography technology a form of 3D printing technology to construct a series of molds depicting the future position of the patients teeth Each mold is a replica of the patients teeth at each stage of the simulated course of treatment From these molds aligners are fabricated by pressureforming polymeric sheets over each mold Aligners are thin clear polymer removable dental appliances that are custom manufactured in a series to correspond to each stage of the patients ClinCheck treatment plan Shipment to the dental professional and patient aligner wear Once manufactured in most countries all the aligners for a patients treatment plan are shipped directly to the dental professional who then dispenses them to the patient at regular checkup intervals Aligners are generally worn for a short period of time corresponding to the stages of the patients approved ClinCheck treatment plan The patient replaces the aligners with the next pair in the series when prescribed advancing tooth movement through each stage At various points in each patients treatment their doctor may place attachments or use other auxiliaries to achieve desired tooth movements per the doctors original prescription and the approved ClinCheck treatment plan At the treating doctors discretion weekly aligner changes are recommended for all Invisalign treatments except for Express packages and may provide shorter treatment time compared with twoweek aligner wear Feature Enhancements We continually introduce enhanced features across our digital platform that includes our Invisalign System iTero intraoral scanners exocad CADCAM solutions and digital workflows to improve treatment outcomes address broader clinical indications or respond to customer demand 2020 saw a number of new innovations intended to enhance the ease by which doctors can diagnose plan and treat patients more efficiently and effectively many of which became critically important to patient care in the wake of limited inperson visits as a result of the COVID19 pandemic In addition to other examples referenced throughout this Annual Report on Form 10K in 2020 Align launched the following products  Invisalign Virtual Appointment and Invisalign Virtual Care  Two continuity of care virtual solutions generally released in May 2020 that offer practice and care transformation to doctors by enabling a range of remote practice services for their patients such as video appointments

of our Invisalign System treatment plans described above provide dental professionals with the option to order additional aligners if the patients treatment deviates from the original treatment plan The number and timing of additional aligner orders are subject to certain requirements noted in our terms and conditions Comprehensive Products  Invisalign Treatment Options Invisalign Comprehensive Packages  The Invisalign Comprehensive Package is used to treat adults and teens for a full spectrum of mild to severe malocclusion and contains a wide variety of Invisalign features to address the doctors treatment goals It also addresses the frequently complex orthodontic needs of teenage or younger patients with advanced features such as mandibular advancement compliance indicators and compensation for tooth eruption These packages include Invisalign Comprehensive Invisalign First Phase 1 and Invisalign First Comprehensive Phase 2 Invisalign First Phase 1 and Invisalign First Comprehensive Phase 2 Packages  Invisalign First Phase 1 Package is designed specifically for younger patients generally between the ages of seven and ten years who frequently have a mixture of primarybaby and permanent teeth Invisalign First Phase 1 treatment provides early interceptive orthodontic treatment traditionally done through arch expanders or partial metal braces before all permanent teeth have erupted Invisalign First Phase 1 clear aligners are designed specifically to address a broad range of younger patients malocclusions including shorter clinical crowns management of erupting dentition and predictable dental arch expansion Our Invisalign First Comprehensive Phase 2 Package is a continuation of Invisalign First Phase 1 and is generally consistent with our Invisalign Comprehensive Package After a patient completes Invisalign First Phase 1 doctors have the option to purchase a discounted Comprehensive Phase 2 Package for that same patient NonComprehensive Products  Invisalign Treatment Options Invisalign Noncomprehensive Packages We offer a variety of lower priced treatment packages for less complex orthodontic cases noncomprehensive relapse cases or straightening prior to restorative or cosmetic treatments such as veneers These treatment packages include Invisalign Express Lite Go Go Plus and Moderate These packages may be offered in select countries andor may differ from region to region Invisalign Go Packages We also offer in various markets Invisalign Go and Invisalign Go Plus streamlined NonComprehensive packages designed for GPs to more easily identify and treat patients with mild malocclusion The Invisalign Go and Invisalign Go Plus packages include case assessment support simplified ClinCheck treatment plans and a progress assessment feature for case monitoring NonCase Products Clear Aligner noncase products include retention products Invisalign training fees and sales of ancillary products such as cleaning material and adjusting tools used by dental professionals during the course of treatment 6 Retention  We offer up to four sets of custom clear aligners called Vivera Retainers made with proprietary material strong enough to maintain tooth position and correct minor relapse if necessary Retainers are generally available for doctors to offer to any of their patients whether they use the Invisalign System or other products including wires and brackets In select markets we also offer single set retainers SmartTrack Aligner Material SmartTrack clear aligner material is a patented customengineered Invisalign clear aligner material that delivers gentle more constant force considered ideal for orthodontic tooth movements Conventional aligner materials relax and lose a substantial percent of their energy in the initial days of wear but SmartTrack material maintains more constant force over time The flexible SmartTrack material also more precisely conforms to tooth morphology attachments and interproximal spaces to improve control of tooth movement throughout treatment In October 2020 we introduced Invisalign G8 with SmartForce Aligner Activation a clear aligner biomechanical innovation that allows doctors to more predictably treat crowding crossbite and deep bite cases through the targeted application of force to teeth through surface contours on the aligners that help control the location direction and intensity of tooth movement Systems and Services Segment Intraoral scanning is a rapidly evolving technology that is having a substantial impact on the practice of dentistry By enabling the dental practitioner to create a 3D image of a patients teeth digital scan using a handheld intraoral scanner digital scanning is faster more efficient precise and comfortable for patients Beginning patient care with the early usage of our iTero intraoral scanners and combining the results with digital workflows designed to assist doctors and patients visualize and evaluate various treatment options with detailed imagery and CADCAM solutions is helping improve treatments outcomes and satisfaction The accuracy of digitally scanned models substantially reduces the rate of restoration remakes meaning patients are recalled less often and the appointment time for the restoration is shorter because of fewer adjustments increasing overall patient satisfaction Digital models also reduce the carbon footprint associated with the shipping of the materials used to create PVS impressions the shipping of those impressions and their disposal Moreover the digital model file can be used for various procedures and services including fabrication of physical dental models for use by labs to create restorative units such as veneers inlays onlays crowns bridges and implant abutments digital records storage aid to caries detection orthodontic diagnosis orthodontic retainers and appliances and Invisalign digital impression submission iTero Scanner  The iTero Element scanner is available as a single hardware platform with software options for restorative or orthodontic procedures The expanded portfolio includes the iTero Element 2 the iTero Element Flex iTero Element 5D Imaging System and iTero Element Plus Series of intraoral scanners which are each available in select regions and countries These products build on the existing high precision fullcolor imaging and fast scan times of the iTero Element portfolio while streamlining orthodontic and restorative workflows The iTero scanner is interoperable with our Invisalign treatment such that a full arch or full mouth digital scan can be submitted as part of the Invisalign System case submission process In February 2019 we launched the iTero Element 5D Imaging system which provides a new comprehensive approach to clinical applications workflows and user experience that expands the suite of existing highprecision fullcolor imagining and fast scan times of the iTero Element scanner portfolio and in March 2020 we received US FDA 501K clearance for the system In addition to offering all of the features and functionality of the iTero Element 2 scanner the iTero Element 5D scanner is the first integrated dental imaging system that simultaneously records 3D intraoral color and nearinfrared NIRI imaging and enables comparison over time using the iTero TimeLapse

chairside milling and laboratory CADCAM systems 7 Orthodontic software for iTero Our iTero s oftware is designed for orthodontists for digital records storage orthodontic diagnosis and for the fabrication of printed models and retainers CADCAM Services and Ancillary Products CADCAM Services The acquisition of exocads CADCAM software in April 2020 broadens Aligns digital platform reach by adding technology that addresses restorative needs in an endtoend digital platform workflow to facilitate orthorestorative and comprehensive dentistry exocad software is licensed and sold separately Ancillary Products  We sell disposable sleeves for the wand and other ancillary products for the iTero scanner iTero Models and Dies An accurate physical model and dies are manufactured based on the digital scan and sent to the laboratory of the dentists choice for completion of the needed restoration The laboratory also has the option to export the digital file for immediate production of coping and fullcontour restorations on their laboratory CADCAM systems The laboratory then completes the ceramic buildup or staining and glazing and delivers the end result  a precisely fitting restoration Third Party Scanners and Digital scans  We accept case submissions for our clear aligner products in two ways 1 physical impressions of the patients teeth or 2 intraoral scans of their teeth With respect to intraoral scans we accept scans from iTero scanners and certain thirdparty scanners that have interoperability relationship with our systems and processes iTero Applications and Tools Invisalign Outcome Simulator  The Invisalign Outcome Simulator is an exclusive chairside and cloudbased application for the iTero scanner that allows doctors to help patients visualize how their teeth may look at the end of Invisalign treatment This is achieved through a dual view layout that shows a prospective patient an image of hisher own current dentition next to hisher simulated final position after Invisalign treatment Invisalign Progress Assessment tool The Invisalign Progress Assessment tool provides the ability to compare a patients new scan with a specific stage of their ClinCheck treatment plan allowing doctors to visually assess and communicate Invisalign treatment progress with an easy to read colorcoded tooth movement report TimeLapse Technology The TimeLapse technology allows doctors or practitioners to compare a patients historic 3D scans to the presentday scan enabling clinicians to identify and measure orthodontic movement tooth wear and gingival recession This highlights areas of diagnostic interest to dental professionals and helps foster a proactive conversation with the patient regarding potential restorative or orthodontic solutions Our iTero Element scanners are offered in a number of software configurations such as Ortho Comprehensive Restorative Comprehensive and Restorative Foundation These software packages are included in the price of the system They enable various orthodontic and restorative workflows as well as provide other applications including Invisalign Outcome Simulator Invisalign Case Assessment tool Invisalign Progress Assessment tool and iTero TimeLapse technology Other proprietary software mentioned in this Annual Report on Form 10K such as ClinCheck and ClinCheck Pro software the Invisalign Doctor Site and feature enhancements are included as part of the Invisalign System and are not sold separately nor do they contribute as individual items to revenues Business Strategy Our goal remains to establish the Invisalign System as the standard method for treating malocclusion and our intraoral scanning platform as the preferred scanning protocol for digital dental scans Our technology and innovations are designed to meet the demands of todays patients with treatment options that are convenient comfortable affordable while helping to improve overall oral health We strive to help our doctors move their practices forward by connecting them with new patients providing digital solutions to help increase practice efficiency and helping them deliver the best possible treatment outcomes and experiences to millions of people around the world We achieve this by focusing on and executing to our strategic growth drivers International Expansion We continue increasing our presence globally by making our products available in more countries to more consumers During 2020 we shipped our Invisalign System to our 2 millionth patient in EMEA and 1 millionth patient in APAC We expect to continue expanding our business by investing in resources infrastructure and initiatives that will drive Invisalign treatment growth in our current and new international markets As our core 8 international countries continue to grow in both number of new Invisalign trained doctors and customer utilization we strive to make sure we can support that growth through investments such as headcount clinical support product improvements technological innovations education and advertising In addition we are scaling and expanding our operations and facilities to better support our

intraoral scanners Our digital treatment planning facilities are located worldwide including in Costa Rica China and other international locations Information regarding risks associated with our manufacturing process and foreign operations may be found in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10K under the heading Risk Factors Our quality system is required to be in compliance with the Quality System regulations enforced by the FDA and similar regulations enforced by other worldwide regulatory authorities We are certified to EN ISO 134852003 an internationally recognized standard for medical device manufacturing We have a formal documented quality system by which quality objectives are defined understood and achieved Systems processes and procedures are implemented to ensure high levels of product and service quality We monitor the effectiveness of the quality system based on internal data and direct customer feedback and strive to continually improve our systems and processes taking corrective action as needed Since the manufacturing process of our products requires substantial and varied technical expertise we believe that our manufacturing capacity and capabilities are important to our success In order to produce our highly customized highly precise medical quality products in volume we have developed a number of proprietary processes and technologies These technologies include complex software algorithms and solutions CT scanning stereolithography and automated aligner fabrication To increase the efficiency of our manufacturing processes we continue to focus our efforts on software development and the improvement of ratelimiting processes or bottlenecks We continuously upgrade our proprietary threedimensional treatment planning software to enhance computer analysis of treatment data and to reduce time spent on manual 9 and judgmental tasks for each case thereby increasing the efficiency of our technicians In addition to improve efficiency and increase the scale of our operations we continue to invest in the development of automated systems for the fabrication and packaging of aligners We are highly dependent on manufacturers of specialized scanning equipment rapid prototyping machines resin and other advanced materials for our aligners as well as the optics electronic and other mechanical components of our intraoral scanners We maintain single supply relationships for many of these machines and materials technologies In particular our CT scanning and stereolithography equipment used in our aligner manufacturing and many of the critical components for the optics of our intraoral scanners are provided by single or sole source suppliers We also currently purchase our resin and polymer the primary raw materials used in our manufacturing process for clear aligners from a single source A discussion of the risks of our supply and manufacturing operations may be found in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10K under the heading  Risk Factors Sales and Marketing Our sales efforts are focused on increasing adoption and utilization of the Invisalign System by orthodontists and GPs worldwide and integrating the iTero scanner and exocad CADCAM products into dental labs and practices The scanner is an important component to the customer experience and is central to a digital approach as well as overall customer utilization of Invisalign treatments In each region we have direct sales and support organizations which include quota carrying sales representatives sales management and sales administration We also have distribution partners in certain markets Our sales and marketing personnel are organized to support orthodontists and GP dentists separately allowing highly trained and specialized personnel to serve each customer category thereby increasing our focus and effectiveness on both We continue to expand in existing markets through targeted investments in sales resources professional marketing and education programs along with consumer marketing in select countries We provide training marketing and clinical support to orthodontists and GPs As of December 31 2020 we had approximately 102000 active Invisalign trained doctors which we define as having submitted at least one case in the prior 12month period Research and Development We are committed to investing in worldclass technology development which we believe is critical to achieving our goal of establishing the Invisalign System as the standard method for treating malocclusion and our intraoral scanning platform as the preferred scanning protocol for digital dental scans Our research and development activities are directed toward developing the technology innovations that we believe will deliver our next generation of products and platforms These activities range from accelerating product and clinical innovation to developing manufacturing process improvements to researching future technologies and products In an effort to demonstrate the broad treatment capabilities of the Invisalign System various clinical case studies and articles have been published that highlight the clinical applicability of Invisalign treatment to malocclusion cases including those of severe complexity We undertake precommercialization trials and testing of our technological improvements to the product and manufacturing process We furthermore fund research in the field of orthodontics and dentistry through initiatives such as our Annual Research Award Program which was in its 11th year in 2020 and our partnership with MedTech Innovator Asia Pacific a nonprofit startup accelerator for the medical technology industry that connects healthcare industry leaders with innovative medical technology startups for mentorship and support Intellectual Property We believe our intellectual property portfolio represents a substantial business advantage As of December 31 2020 we had 553 active US patents 592 active foreign patents and 648 pending global patent applications Our active US patents expire between 2021 and 2039 When patents expire we lose the protection and competitive advantages they provided which could negatively impact our operating results however we continue to pursue further intellectual property protection through US and foreign patent applications and nondisclosure agreements We also seek to protect our software documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws We furthermore have a broad and diverse trademark portfolio that we use to highlight and protect our universally recognized brands Information regarding risks associated with our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights may be found in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10K under the heading Risk Factors 10 Seasonal Fluctuations General economic conditions impact our business and financial results and we have historically experienced seasonal trends within our two operating segments customer channels and the geographic locations that we serve Sales of Invisalign treatments are often weaker in Europe during the summer months due to our customers and their patients being on holiday and seasonally higher in China during the third quarter particularly related to increased teen cases Similarly other international holidays like Lunar New Year can also negatively impact our sales in APAC In North America summer is typically the busiest season for orthodontists with practices that have a high percentage of adolescent and teenage patients as many parents want to get their teenagers started in treatment before the start of the school year however many GPs are on vacation during this time and therefore tend to start fewer cases For our Systems and Services segment capital equipment sales are often stronger in the fourth calendar quarter Consequently these seasonal trends have caused and may continue to cause fluctuations in our quarterly results including fluctuations in sequential revenue growth rates Moreover the COVID19 pandemic has disrupted many seasonal patterns and it remains unclear when or if they will return to historical norms Competition Our clear aligner products compete directly against traditional treatments using metal brackets and wires and increasingly against clear aligner products manufactured and distributed by various companies both within and outside the US We also face competition in the emerging and rapidly evolving markets for intraoral scanners and CADCAM software Although the number of competitors varies by segment product geography and customer they include new and wellestablished regional competitors in certain foreign markets as well as larger companies or divisions of larger companies with substantial sales marketing research and financial capabilities Due in part to the expiration of certain of our clear aligner key patents beginning in 2017 we are facing increased competition in the clear aligner market In addition corresponding foreign patents began expiring in 2018 which has increased competition in the clear aligner markets outside the US These competitors include existing larger companies in certain markets who have the ability to leverage their existing channels in the dental market to compete directly with us directtoconsumer DTC companies that provide clear aligners using a remote teledentistry model requiring little or no inoffice care from trained and licensed doctors and doctors themselves who can manufacture custom aligners in their offices using modern 3D printing technology Unlike our DTC competitors we are committed to doctors being at the core of our business strategy and Invisalign Treatment requires a doctors prescription and an inperson physical examination of the patients dentition before treatment can begin Information regarding risks associated with increased competition may be found in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10K under the heading  Risk Factors  We believe we are well positioned to compete in the markets we target Our significant historical and ongoing investments in research and design in around the movement of teeth SmartTrack aligner materials and design intraoral scanning 3D manufacturing and an in depth understanding of the drivers and motivations within the orthodontic and GP dental markets are among a few of our key competitive factors that compare favorably with our competitors products and services Government Regulation Many countries throughout the world have established regulatory frameworks for commercialization of medical devices As a designer manufacturer and marketer of medical devices we are obligated to comply with the respective framework of these countries to obtain and maintain access to these global markets The framework often defines requirements for marketing authorizations which vary by country Failure to obtain appropriate marketing authorization and to meet all local requirements including specific quality and safety standards in any country in which we currently market our products could cause commercial disruption andor subject us to sanctions and fines Delays in receipt of or a failure to receive such marketing authorizations or the loss of any previously received authorizations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations With regards to premarket authorization in the US many of our products are classified as medical devices under the US Food Drug and Cosmetic Act FDC Act The FDC Act requires these products when sold in the US to be safe and effective for their intended use and to comply with medical device regulations defined by the FDA The regulatory framework depends on a set of written processes for ensuring consistent quality called a Quality Management System QMS coupled with a product marketing authorization which depends on the risk classification of the product This regulatory framework is comparable to the framework established in the European Union EU Within the EU our products are subject to the requirements defined by the Medical Device Regulation EU 2017745 which replaced the Medical Device Directive 9342EEC with a final transition date of May 26 2021 Similar market access regulations exist in Brazil China Japan and other countries Our QMS is routinely audited by certification bodies as well as country regulators for compliance with applicable regulations 11 We believe we are in compliance with all state federal and international regulatory requirements applicable to our products We are also subject to various laws inside and outside the US concerning our relationships with healthcare professionals and government officials price reporting and regulation the promotion sale and marketing of our products and services the importation and exportation of our products the operation of our facilities and distribution of our products As a global company we are subject to varying degrees of government regulation in the various countries in which we do business and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent oversight and enforcement Initiatives sponsored by government agencies legislative bodies and the private sector to limit the growth of healthcare expenses generally are ongoing in markets where we do business It is not possible to predict at this time the longterm impact of such cost containment measures on our future business Our customers are healthcare providers that may be reimbursed by state or federal funded programs such as Medicaid a foreign national healthcare program or private pay insurance each of which may offer some degree of oversight Many government agencies both domestic and foreign have increased their enforcement activities with respect to healthcare providers and companies in recent years Enforcement actions and associated defense can be expensive and any resulting findings carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties In addition we must comply with numerous data protection requirements that span from individual state and national laws in the US and China to multinational requirements in the EU In the US final regulations implementing amendments to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 HIPAA became effective in the latter part of 2013 with the HIPAA Omnibus Rule We are also required to be in compliance with the California Consumer Privacy Act CCPA In the EU we must comply with the General Data Protection Regulation GDPR which serves as a harmonization of European dataprivacy laws With relocation of our EMEA headquarters to Switzerland the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection FADP passed September 25 2020 becomes increasingly important Expansion into LATAM markets requires us to comply with Brazils Lei Geral de Proteo de Dados LGPD

encouraging inclusion in the workplace makes Align a more welcoming and enjoyable place to work Our management team is comprised of a diverse group from around the globe who are committed to promoting and encouraging the health and wellbeing of our employees at work and in society overall Our work culture is designed to create innumerable benefits for our employees customers consumers and organization We believe we are at our best and our success has been driven by different backgrounds orientations beliefs perspectives and capabilities in our workforce Training and Professional Development  Training is an integral part of developing and retaining our employees and creating a culture of leadership within the Company This begins with our Code which was significantly revised in 2020 to emphasize our strong commitment to ethical business practices in all aspects of our operations Every employee and contractor is required to review the Code and confirm they understand it and we routinely reference the Code in presentations and as part of everyday operations As a further part of our standard onboarding program we train employees on important environmental health and safety topics to protect them and our environment as we operate our business As a general practice employees are trained to perform their jobs in accordance with any and all applicable statutoryregulatory requirements and that training is routinely readministered updated and refreshed Employees are encouraged to participate in a variety of Company provided 12 learning resources through our corporate Align University platform including professional development events external training programs based on individual needs businessled enterprise leader learning events diversity and inclusion online business skills courses and onsite classroom events This is in addition to opportunities offered for job development such as management skills training and trainings that improve their opportunities for advancement Compensation and Benefits  Our commitment to our employees starts with benefit and compensation programs that reflect the value and the contributions our employees make In addition to competitive base pay we offer an assortment of benefits that vary by country including health and welfare benefit plans retirement planning services and benefits holiday and leave policies equity participation programs such as our Incentive Plan and Employee Stock Purchase Plan and charitable and community service opportunities Besides these we also offer discounts to our employees and their dependents when they undergo Invisalign treatment Importantly during the initial onset of the pandemic in early 2020 we committed to protect our employees financially by declaring that we did not intend to furlough lay off or cut employee pay We believe our strong operational performance in the second half of 2020 is directly attributable to that decision along with the exceptional efforts of our employees throughout the pandemic Health and Safety  Our employees are essential to us as a business and their health and wellbeing is critical to our success and their continuing achievements We therefore offer a wide variety of robust programs and initiatives designed to promote the overall health and welfare of all our employees and their families In addition to the compensation and benefits listed above we offer family support services healthcare initiatives and career services support among many others In response to the COVID19 pandemic and the impacts of remote working we have encouraged employees to take time away from work to be with their families and implemented initiatives to promote better worklife balance In addition we have several health and safety programs in place to help protect our employees For instance we have training programs and courses that employees exposed to particular risks are required to take and update periodically Examples include hazardous material training emergency response and evacuation training ergonomics training biohazard and personal protective equipment training and more recently COVID19 related safety training We also invest to ensure our facilities and equipment are safe by complying with OSHA or other statutory standards Charitable and Community Services We provide opportunities for and actively encourage employees to support local charities through volunteerism team building and donation and matching programs and are extremely proud of the generosity and dedication of our employees especially during our annual Month of Smiles initiative in October In addition through our Align Foundation we support businesses with complementary missions including Operation Smile and Americas ToothFairy as well as provide product donations to the dental community to help patients in need of a healthy beautiful smile For example in 2020 we pledged a 1 million donation to support COVID19 global relief efforts This was in addition to a 1 million renminbi donation to the Chinese Red Cross to support its COVID19 prevention and control efforts and donations of personal protective equipment to hospitals and healthcare providers treating patients with COVID19 For more information on our charitable and community efforts please refer to the Corporate Social Responsibility portion of our website located at

business results of operations and financial condition The second captioned General Risk Factors discusses some of the risks that apply generally to companies and to owning our common stock in particular You should carefully review both sections as well as our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and other information appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10K for important information regarding these and other risks that may affect us The order we have chosen to list the risks below or the sections in which we have identified them should not be interpreted to mean we deem any risks to be more or less important or likely to occur or if any do occur that their impact may be any less significant than others These risk factors should be considered in connection with evaluating the forwardlooking statements contained in this report because they could cause our actual results and conditions to differ materially from those statements Before you invest in Align you should know that investing involves risks including those described below The risks below are not the only ones we face If any of the risks actually occur our business financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected the trading price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 14 Summary of Risk Factors The following is a summary of the risks that are more fully described below in this Risk Factors section Risks Relating to our Business Operations and Strategy  Our results of operations have been materially adversely affected by global and regional efforts to mitigate the spread of COVID19 and we expect this will continue in as yet unknown ways and to varying degrees in the future  Our net revenues are dependent primarily on our Invisalign System and iTero Scanners and any decline in sales or average selling price of these products for any reason may adversely affect net revenues gross margin and net income  Competition in the markets for our products is increasing and we expect aggressive competition from existing competitors other companies that may introduce new technologies in the future and customers who create aligners or retainers in house  An increasingly larger portion of our total revenues are derived from international sales and we are dependent on our international operations which exposes us to foreign operational political and other risks that may harm our business  Demand for our products may not increase as rapidly as we anticipate or may decrease due to a variety of factors including a weakness in general economic conditions and resistance to nontraditional treatment methods  Our success depends on our ability to develop successfully introduce and achieve market acceptance of new products and services  We may not achieve the anticipated benefits from our recent acquisition of exocad in the timeframe expected or at all which may have an adverse effect on our business and our financial results  As we continue to grow we are subject to growth related risks including risks related to excess or constrained capacity and operational inefficiencies at our manufacturing and treat facilities  If we fail to sustain or increase revenue growth while controlling expenses our profitability may decline  Our operating results have and will fluctuate in the future which makes predicting the timing and amount of our revenues costs and expenditures difficult  A disruption in the operations of a primary freight carrier or higher shipping costs could cause a decline in our net revenues or a reduction in our earnings  If we fail to accurately predict our volume growth and hire too many or too few technicians the delivery time of our products could be delayed or our costs may exceed our revenues each of which could adversely affect our results of operations  Our information technology systems are critical to our business System integration and implementation issues and system security risks could disrupt our operations which could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results  If the security of our customer and patient information is compromised or we are unable to comply with data protection laws our operations may be severely adversely impacted patient care could suffer we could be liable for related damages and our reputation could be impaired  In order to deepen our market penetration and raise awareness of our brand and products we may increase the amount we spend on marketing activities which may not ultimately prove successful or an effective use of our resources  Our success depends in part on our proprietary technology and if we fail to successfully obtain or enforce our intellectual property rights our competitive position may be harmed Litigating claims of this type are costly and could distract our management and cause a decline in our results of operations and stock price  Obtaining approvals and complying with governmental regulations particularly healthcare and data privacy compliance is expensive and timeconsuming and any failure to obtain or maintain approvals or comply with regulations regarding our products or services or the products and services of our suppliers or customers could materially harm our sales result in substantial penalties and cause harm to our reputation  If we or any vendors on whose products or services we rely for our products and service infringe the patents or IP rights of other parties or are subject to a patent infringement claim our ability to grow our business may be severely limited 15  We maintain single supply relationships for certain key machines and materials and our business and operating results could be harmed if supply is restricted or ends or the price of raw materials used in our manufacturing process increases  We primarily rely on our direct sales force to sell our products and any failure to train and maintain our key sales force personnel could harm our business  We use distributors for a portion of the importation marketing and sales efforts related to our products and services which exposes us to risks that may be harmful to our sales and operations  Our business exposes us to potential liability for the quality and safety of our products and services how we advertise and market those products and services and how and to whom we sell them and we may incur substantial expenses or be liable for substantial damages or penalties if we are subject to claims or litigation  We are subject to risks associated with our strategic investments Impairments in the value of our investments could negatively impact our financial results General Risk Factors  If we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain key personnel we may be unable to pursue business opportunities or develop our products  Business disruptions could seriously harm our financial condition  Changes in or interpretations of accounting rules and regulations could result in unfavorable accounting charges  We are required to annually assess our internal control over financial reporting and any adverse results from such assessment may result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price  We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations  If we fail to manage our exposure to global financial and securities market risk successfully our operating results and financial statements could be materially impacted  If our goodwill or longlived assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings  Our effective tax rate may vary significantly from period to period  Changes in tax laws or tax rulings could negatively impact our income tax provision and net income  We may acquire other businesses products or technologies in the future which could require significant management attention disrupt our business dilute shareholder value and adversely affect our results of operations  Historically the market price for our common stock has been volatile  We cannot guarantee we will repurchase our common stock again in the future and any repurchases may not achieve our objectives  Future sales of significant amounts of our common stock may depress our stock price Risks Relating to our Business Operations and Strategy Our results of operations have been materially adversely affected by global and regional efforts to mitigate the spread of COVID19 and we expect this will continue in as yet unknown ways and to varying degrees in the future The broad and extensive impact of the COVID19 pandemic on virtually all aspects of our business and society generally has exacerbated many of the preexisting risks to our business by making some or many of them more likely to occur or more impactful when they do occur Accordingly you should consider the risks in this risk factor in addition to and not in lieu of the risks identified throughout this section discussing the risks related to our business COVID19 created significant widespread and unprecedented volatility uncertainty and economic instability disrupting broad aspects of the global economy our operations and the businesses of our customers and suppliers Renewed outbreaks of COVID19 may harm recovering consumer confidence or renew implementation of harsh preventative measures Because COVID19 spreads readily through airways in nasal passages and the mouth our principal customers dental and orthodontic practices were an initial focus leading to the complete or substantial closures of their operations materially harming our sales and sales efforts While practices across all regions have largely reopened many have not returned to prepandemic capacities 16 In response to COVID19 we implemented measures aimed at limiting its spread for the health and safety of our employees customers patients and the communities in which we live and work as well as in accordance with orders and decrees of governmental agencies These measures included diagnostic screenings at our facilities increased social distancing mandates closures of physical offices manufacturing and treatment planning facilities including our US corporate headquarters and regional facilities worldwide implementing remote working where feasible prohibiting nonessential travel and converting underutilized manufacturing capacity to produce personal protective equipment Many of these actions remain in effect and we may implement new or revise existing requirements as circumstances require some of which may be highly disruptive to our business and may ultimately prove wholly or partially ineffective Even if effective if employees perceive them to be inadequate or overly burdensome or they prove difficult to maintain over extended periods of time productivity may decline or we may experience employee unrest slowdowns stoppages or other demands we may fail to timely meet customer demand or fulfill orders the costs to maintain or implement protective measures or deliver our products may increase and we may be subject to increased litigation including product liability and occupational safety and condition claims As the economic and societal impact of the pandemic continues to unfold we are continually evaluating macroeconomic as well as industryspecific factors including the extent our business and financial results are or may be impacted as well as those of our customers and suppliers and the financial health and stability of businesses and consumers overall depends on numerous evolving factors many of which we cannot control nor accurately predict Examples include  the duration scope and severity of governmental business and societal actions in response to the pandemic  the time in which dental practices return to prepandemic operating capacities and our ability to timely and effectively respond to decreases or increases in demand  the impact on worldwide economic activity employment rates and actions taken by central banks and governments  changes in product and services demand particularly for products or services that may be deemed discretionary or that can be delayed or cancelled  the liquidity and financial stability of consumers customers and patients including their willingness to purchase our products and services delays paying for products or services requests for extended payment terms or payment defaults  travel restrictions including those that adversely impair or prohibit patients from visiting their doctors and our sales personnel from interacting with customers  diversion of management as they focus on the short and longterm ramifications of the pandemic  actions by us or our competitors such as price reductions aggressive product promotions changes in or the launch or termination of products or product lines and mergers consolidations and liquidations  the confidence of our customers and patients that our products and solutions are sanitary and safe to use  customer and consumer purchasing behavior changes as pandemicrelated restrictions are curtailed or lifted remote working declines and travel and discretionary spending patterns shift  data privacy and cybersecurity risks from new or expanded use of remote working andor teledentistry by our suppliers customers and us including new or expanded use of online service platforms products and solutions such as video conferencing applications doctor consumer and patient apps inadequately secured computing networks or servers overheard telephone conversations viewable computer screens stolen passwords or access information increased phishing and other cyber threats and  the impact of remote working arrangements on our financial reporting systems and internal control over financial reporting including our ability to ensure information required to be disclosed is timely and accurately recorded processed summarized reported and communicated to management including our Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officers as appropriate to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure The impact of the pandemic continues to evolve and we cannot predict the future impact on our business or results of operations although it may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and stock price as well as the businesses of our customers and economic activity generally Our net revenues are dependent primarily on our Invisalign System and iTero Scanners and any decline in sales or average selling price of these products for any reason may adversely affect net revenues gross margin and net income Our net revenues are largely dependent on sales of our Invisalign System of clear aligners an d iTero intraoral scanners Of the two we expect net revenues from the sale of the Invisalign System primarily our comprehensive products will continue to account for the majority of our net revenues making the continued and widespread acceptance of the Invisalign System by orthodontists GPs and consumers critical to our future success Sales of our iTero scanners are becoming a larger percentage of our overall revenues and we expect the acquisition of exocad to complement the adoption of digital dentistry If orthodontists and GPs experience a reduction in consumer demand for orthodontic services if consumers prove unwilling to adopt Invisalign System treatment as rapidly or in the volumes we anticipate and at the prices offered if orthodontists or GPs choose to continue 17 using wires and brackets or competitive products rather than the Invisalign System if sales of our iTero scanners decline or fail to grow sufficiently or as expected if the acquisition of exocad does not produce the results expected or if the average selling price of our products declines for any reason our operating results could be harmed The average selling price of our products particularly our Invisalign System are influenced by numerous factors including the type and timing of products sold price increases and reductions product mix product and services bundling promotions and foreign exchange rates We provide volumebased discount programs to our customers In addition we sell a number of products at different list prices which may differ based on country and season If we change volumebased discount programs that affect our average selling prices if we introduce price reductions or consumer rebate programs if we implement new or expand existing discount programs or participation in these programs increases if our critical accounting estimates materially differ from actual behavior or results or if our geographic channel or product mix shifts to lower priced products or to products that have a higher percentage of deferred revenue our average selling prices would be adversely affected Moreover some programs may be unsuccessful or may drive demand in unexpected ways Were any of the foregoing to occur our net revenues gross profit gross margin and net income may decline Competition in the markets for our products is increasing and we expect aggressive competition from existing competitors other companies that may introduce new technologies in the future and customers who create aligners or retainers in house The dental industry is in a period of immense and rapid digital transformation involving products technologies distribution channels and business models While our clear aligner and iTero scanners facilitate this transition whether our technologies will achieve market acceptance and if adopted whether and when they may become obsolete as new offerings become available remains unclear Currently our clear aligner system competes directly against traditional metal wires and brackets and increasingly against clear aligners manufactured and distributed by new market entrants and traditional manufacturers of wires and brackets both within and outside the US and from traditional medical device companies laboratories startups and in some cases doctors themselves Due in part to market opportunities and the expiration of certain of our key patents beginning in 2017 competition in the clear aligner market is increasing The number and types of competitors are diverse and vary by segment geography and customers including new and wellestablished regional competitors as well as larger companies or divisions of larger companies with substantial sales marketing research and financial capabilities including the ability to leverage existing dental market channels to compete directly with us Our competitors also include directtoconsumer DTC companies that provide clear aligners using a remote teledentistry model requiring little or no inoffice care from trained and licensed doctors and doctors themselves who can manufacture custom aligners in their offices using modern 3D printing technology Large consumer product companies may also enter the orthodontic supply market The manipulation and movement of teeth and bone is a delicate process with potentially painful and debilitating results if not appropriately performed and monitored Accordingly we are committed to delivering our Invisalign System solutions primarily through trained and skilled doctors Invisalign System treatment requires a doctors prescription and an in person physical examination of the patients dentition before beginning treatment however with the advent of DTC providers accompanied by significant advertising campaigns there has been a shift away from traditional practices that may impact our primary selling channels We also believe doctors are sampling alternative products andor taking advantage of competitive promotions and sale opportunities In addition we may face competition from companies that introduce new technologies and we may be unable to compete with these competitors or they may render our technology obsolete or economically unattractive If we are unable to compete effectively with existing products or respond effectively to any new technologies our business could be harmed To stimulate product and services demand we have a history of offering volume discounts price reductions and other promotions to targeted customers and consumers Whether or not successful these promotional campaigns can have unexpected and unintended consequences including reduced gross margins profitability and average selling prices loss of market share and may discourage dental professionals efforts and commitment to use our products any of which could materially adversely affect our net revenues volume growth net income and stock price We cannot assure that we will be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors or that competitive pressures will not have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition An increasingly larger portion of our total revenues are derived from international sales and we are dependent on our international operations which exposes us to foreign operational political and other risks that may harm our business We earn an increasingly larger portion of our total revenues from international sales generated through our foreign direct and indirect operations and we expect to increase our sales and presence outside the US particularly in markets we believe have highgrowth potential Moreover many of our key production steps are performed in locations outside of the US For instance technicians use a sophisticated internally developed computermodeling program to prepare digital treatment plans 18 ClinCheck which are approved by licensed doctors before being transmitted electronically for to our aligner fabrication facilities These digital files form the basis of the ClinCheck treatment plan and are used to manufacture our aligners Our digital treatment planning and aligner fabrication are performed in multiple international locations including largescale operations in Mexico Costa Rica and China and we continue to establish additional sites closer to our international customers Also we maintain significant regional sales and marketing operations in Switzerland Singapore and China along with research and development operations globally including in the US Russia Israel and Germany Our reliance on international operations exposes us to risks and uncertainties that may affect our business or results of operations including  difficulties managing international operations including any travel restrictions on us or our customers  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  import and export risks penalties controls license requirements and restrictions  controlling production volume and quality of the manufacturing process  difficulties hiring and retaining employees particularly employees with software and technological design and development backgrounds necessary to create develop and perform the more technical aspects of our operations as well as to service market and sell complex medical devices and technologies  the engagement in activities by our employees contractors partners and agents prohibited by international and local trade labor and other laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials including the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act the UK Bribery Act of 2010 and export control laws in spite of our policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws  increased expense of developing testing making and marketing localized versions of our products  political military social economic or business instability acts of terrorism and acts of war including increased levels of violence and protests in various regions of the world including regions in which we operate such as the United States Mexico Hong Kong the Middle East and Africa In addition some of our employees in Israel are obligated to perform annual reserve duty in the Israeli military and may be called for additional active duty under emergency circumstances which may materially impair all or a portion of our business operations critical to our iTero operations Were any of these events or conditions to occur the impact to us our employees and customers is uncertain particularly if emergency circumstances armed conflicts or an escalation in political instability or violence were to occur  general geopolitical instability and the responses to it such as the possibility threat of imposition of or changes in sanctions trade restrictions and tariffs particularly in key customer or manufacturing markets such as China Mexico or other countries  interruptions and limitations in telecommunication services or critical systems or applications reliant on a stable and uninterrupted communications infrastructure  production or material transportation delays or disruption including as a result of customs clearance workforce unrest slowdowns or stoppages unionization efforts or as a result of disasters whether as a natural forces or human caused  burdens of complying with a wide variety of regional and local laws including antitrust and competition laws  the impact of governmentled initiatives to encourage the purchase or support of domestic vendors which can affect the willingness of customers to purchase products from or collaborate to promote interoperability of products with companies whose headquarters or primarily operations are not domestic  reduced intellectual property rights protections as compared to the protections afforded under the laws of the US  longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection and  potential adverse tax consequences The potential impacts of the United Kingdoms UK withdrawal from the European Union EU is still unfolding and could among other potential outcomes adversely affect the tax tax treaty currency operational legal and regulatory regimes to which our businesses are subject including those involving data privacy and the regulation of medical devices The withdrawal could also among other potential outcomes disrupt the free movement of goods services people data and information and significantly disrupt trade Further uncertainty around these and related issues could lead to adverse effects on the economies of the UK EU and the other economies in which we operate Should any of these factors either individually or in combination occur they could materially impact our international operations and adversely affect our business as a whole Demand for our products may not increase as rapidly as we anticipate or may decrease due to a variety of factors including a weakness in general economic conditions and resistance to nontraditional treatment methods Consumer spending habits are affected by among other things pandemics prevailing economic conditions levels of employment salaries and wage rates debt obligations discretionary income consumer confidence and consumer perception of current and future economic conditions A decrease in US or certain international economies or an uncertain economic outlook both of which have or are occurring as a result of the COVID19 pandemic would adversely affect consumer spending 19 habits which may among other things result in a decrease in the number of overall orthodontic case starts reduced patient traffic in dentists offices reduction in consumer spending on elective nonurgent or higher value procedures or a reduction in the demand for dental services generally any of which would materially adversely affect our sales and operating results Conversely the pandemic may have temporarily limited options for consumer discretionary spending and demand for our products may be harmed once travel and other restrictions are eased Weakness in the global economy results in a challenging environment for selling dental technologies and dentists may postpone investments in capital equipment such as intraoral scanners and CADCAM software In addition Invisalign treatment which accounts for the vast majority of our net revenues represents a significant change from traditional metal brackets and wires orthodontic treatment and customers and consumers may not find it costeffective or preferable to traditional treatment For instance a number of dental professionals continue to believe the Invisalign treatment is appropriate for only a limited percentage of patients Increased market acceptance of our products depends in part upon the recommendations of dental professionals as well as other factors including effectiveness safety ease of use reliability aesthetics and price compared to competing products and treatment methods Our success depends on our ability to develop successfully introduce and achieve market acceptance of new products and services Our success depends on our ability to profitably and quickly develop manufacture market and obtain regulatory approval or clearance of new products and services along with improvements to existing products and services There is no assurance we can successfully develop sell and achieve market acceptance of our products and services The extent of and rate at which market acceptance and penetration are achieved by any products or offerings is a function of many variables including our ability to  correctly predict timely develop and cost effectively manufacture or bring to market solutions that meet future customer needs and preferences with the features and functionality they desire or expect  allocate our research and development funding to products with higher growth prospects  ensure compatibility of our technology services and systems with those of our customers  anticipate and rapidly respond to new competitive products product offerings and technological innovations  differentiate our products and product offerings from our competitors as well as other products in our own portfolio and successfully articulate the benefits of those differences to our customers  innovate and develop new technologies and applications and timely obtain approval or clearance by government agencies such as the FDA and analogous agencies in other countries   qualify for thirdparty reimbursement for procedures using our products  successfully identify timely develop and market products and services to new and evolving target markets and  encourage customers to adopt new technologies If we fail to accurately predict customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenues If we successfully innovate and develop new products and product enhancements we may incur substantial costs doing so and our profitability may suffer Even if our new products are successfully introduced it may be difficult to gain market share and acceptance particularly if doctors require education to understand the benefits of the new products or measure their success only after extended periods of time required to treat patients For instance it can take up to 24 months or longer to treat patients using our Invisalign System Consequently doctors may be unwilling to adopt our new products until they successfully complete one or more cases or until more historical clinical results are available Any failure to successfully develop and introduce or achieve market acceptance of new products or enhancements to existing products could materially adversely affect our operating results and cause our net revenues to decline We may not achieve the anticipated benefits from our recent acquisition of exocad in the timeframe expected or at all which may have an adverse effect on our business and our financial results We closed our acquisition of exocad on April 1 2020 There is no guarantee that the acquisition will achieve the desired benefits and synergies or that the exocad CADCAM software will continue to succeed in the marketplace In addition we do not have a history of significant acquisitions and integrating exocad during the COVID19 pandemic poses challenges which may make it difficult to achieve the expected financial technical or strategic benefits of the acquisition in the time frames anticipated if at all Potential risks we may experience include  difficulties integrating the business of exocad in the timeframes expected or as anticipated and without adversely impacting our existing operations or the operations of exocad 20  slower adoption of or technological difficulties uniting our product and service offerings to produce solutions that efficiently and effectively integrate with the workflows between doctors laboratories and other market participants  diversion of management resources  the inability to retain or attract key personnel  the failure to accurately estimate the potential markets and market shares for the companies products the nature and extent of competitive responses to the acquisition and the ability to achieve or exceed projected market growth rates  difficulties costeffectively integrating and dealing with tax employment logistics and other related issues unique to international operations particularly when travel restrictions make collaboration efforts more difficult  the potential that our due diligence did not uncover risks and potential liabilities that we fail to adequately mitigate or control them or that new risks and potential liabilities associated with exocad arise  the failure to successfully manage relationships with Align and exocads historic customers suppliers and strategic partners and develop new relationships  product development delays and errors  possible inconsistencies in standards internal controls procedures and policies which may make it more difficult to implement and harmonize companywide financial reporting forecasting and budgeting accounting billing information technology and other systems  all or material portions of the expected synergies and benefits of the acquisition may change or disappear or may take longer to realize  negative impact on our GAAP results of operations financial condition and liquidity from acquisitionrelated costs charges amortization of intangible assets andor asset or goodwill impairment charges  outcomes or rulings in known or as yet to be discovered regulatory enforcement intellectual property and other litigation antibribery and corruption or other similar matters that are alone or in the aggregate materially adverse and  our ability to protect our intellectual property rights as well as protect our IT networks from cybersecurity threats and ensure customer and sensitive personal and health data remain secure If we cannot successfully integrate exocad with our existing business our results of operations and financial condition could be harmed As we continue to grow we are subject to growth related risks including risks related to excess or constrained capacity and operational inefficiencies at our manufacturing and treat facilities We are subject to growth related risks including excess or constrained capacity and pressure on our internal systems and personnel In order to manage current operations and future growth effectively we will need to continue to implement and improve our operational financial and management information systems and to hire train motivate manage and retain employees We may be unable to manage such growth effectively Any such failure could have a material adverse impact on our business operations and prospects We continue to establish additional order acquisition treatment planning and manufacturing facilities closer to our international customers in order to provide doctors with better experiences improve their confidence in using the Invisalign System and iTero intraoral scanners to treat more patients and provide redundancy should other facilities be temporarily or permanently unavailable Our ability to obtain regulatory clearance and certifications for move into plan construct and equip additional order acquisition treatment planning and manufacturing facilities is subject to significant risk and uncertainty including risks related to establishing facilities such as hiring and retaining employees and delays and cost overruns any of which may be out of our control and may negatively impact our gross margin In addition these facilities may be located in higher cost regions compared to Mexico China and Costa Rica which may negatively impact our gross margin If the transition into additional facilities is significantly delayed if a facility is required to temporarily or permanently partially or fully shut down or demand for our products increases we may be unable to fulfill orders timely or at all which may negatively impact our financial results reputation and overall business In addition because adapting production capacity and related cost structures to changing market conditions takes time our facility capacity may at times exceed or fall short of our production requirements For instance as a result of the COVID19 pandemic sales in the final weeks of the first quarter of 2020 declined substantially and operations at our manufacturing facilities declined shortly thereafter Thereafter as dental practices reopened we experienced a rapid increase in demand If product demand decreases or increases more than forecast we could be required to write off inventory or record excess capacity charges we may be required to purchase or lease additional or larger facilities and additional equipment or we may be unable to fulfill customer demand in the time frames and with the quantities they require any of which may take time to accomplish lower our gross margin inhibit sales or harm our reputation or if we are required to implement additional protective measures to safeguard our employees productivity could decline Production of our clear aligners and intraoral scanners may also be limited by capacity constraints due to a variety of factors including our dependency on third party vendors for key components 21 in addition to limited production yields Any or all of these problems could result in the loss of customers provide an opportunity for competing products to gain market acceptance and otherwise harm our business and financial results  If we fail to sustain or increase revenue growth while controlling expenses our profitability may decline If we are to sustain or increase profitability in future periods we need to continue increasing our net revenues while controlling expenses Because our business and the markets we target are evolving it is difficult to predict our future operating results or levels of growth or declines and we have not in the past and may be unable in the future to sustain or regain our historical growth rates which may cause our profitability to decline Our operating results have and will continue to fluctuate in the future which makes predicting the timing and amount of our revenues costs and expenditures difficult Our quarterly and annual operating results have and will continue to fluctuate for a variety of reasons including as a result of changing doctor and consumer product demand Some of the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include  limited visibility into and difficulty predicting from quarter to quarter the level of activity in our customers practices  changes in geographic channel or product mix  weakness in consumer spending and confidence or a slowdown in domestic or international economies  higher manufacturing delivery and inventory costs  competition in general and competitive developments in the market  changes in relationships with our dental support organizations and distributors including timing of orders  changes in the timing of revenue recognition and changes in our average selling prices including as a result of the timing of receipt of product orders and shipments product and services mix geographic mix product and services deferrals the introduction of new products and software releases product pricing bundling and promotions modifications to our terms and conditions such as payment terms or as a result of new accounting pronouncements or changes to critical accounting estimates including without limitation those estimates based on such matters as our predicted usage of additional aligners  the creditworthiness liquidity and solvency of our customers and their ability to timely make payments when due  fluctuations in currency exchange rates against the US dollar  our inability to scale suspend or reduce production based on variations in product demand  seasonal fluctuations including those related to patient demographics such as teen buying habits in the US China and Europe as well as the number of doctors in their offices and their availability to take appointments  success of or changes to our marketing programs from quarter to quarter  timing and fluctuation of spending around marketing and brand awareness campaigns and industry trade shows  our reliance on our contract manufacturers for the production of subassemblies for our intraoral scanners  increased advertising or marketing efforts or aggressive price competition from competitors  changes to our effective tax rate  unanticipated delays and disruptions in the manufacturing process caused by insufficient capacity or availability of raw materials turnover in the labor force or the introduction of new production processes power outages natural or other disasters pandemics or general economic conditions impacting the solvency of vendors in our supply chain  underutilization of manufacturing and treat facilities  major changes in available technology or the preferences of customers may cause our current product offerings to become less competitive or obsolete  costs and expenditures in connection with such things as the establishment of treatment planning and fabrication facilities the hiring and deployment of personnel and litigation  unanticipated delays in our receipt of patient records made through intraoral scanners for any reason  disruptions to our business due to political economic or other social instability or any governmental regulatory or similar actions including the impact of epidemics and pandemics such as COVID19 any of which results in changes in consumer spending habits limiting or restricting patient visits to orthodontists or general practitioners as well as any impact on workforce absenteeism  inaccurate forecasting of net revenues production and other operating costs  investments in research and development to develop new products and enhancements and  material impairments of goodwill longlived assets or notes receivable To respond to these and other factors we may make business decisions that adversely affect our operating results such as modifications to our pricing policy and payment terms promotions development efforts product releases business structure or operations Most of our expenses such as employee compensation and lease obligations are relatively fixed in the short term Moreover our expense levels are based in part on our expectations for future revenues As a result if our net revenues for a 22 particular period fall below expectations we may be unable to reduce spending to offset any shortfall in net revenues Due to these and other factors we do not believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our operating results are meaningful A disruption in the operations of a primary freight carrier or higher shipping costs could cause a decline in our net revenues or a reduction in our earnings We are dependent on commercial freight carriers primarily UPS to deliver our products If the operations of these carriers are disrupted for any reason we may be unable to timely deliver our products to our customers If we cannot deliver our products on time and cost effectively customers may choose alternative products causing our net revenues and gross margins to decline possibly materially If fuel costs increase so do our freight costs In addition we earn an increasingly larger portion of our total revenues from international sales International sales carry higher shipping costs which could negatively impact our gross margin and results of operations If freight costs materially increase and we are unable to pass that increase along to our customers or otherwise offset such increases in our cost of net revenues our gross margin and financial results could be adversely affected If we fail to accurately predict our volume growth and hire too many or too few technicians the delivery time of our products could be delayed or our costs may exceed our revenues each of which could adversely affect our results of operations Treatment planning is a key step leading to our manufacturing process which relies on sophisticated computer software This requires new technicians to undergo a relatively long training process often 120 days or longer As a result if we are unable to accurately predict our volume growth we may have an insufficient number of trained technicians to ensure products are manufactured and delivered within the time frame our customers expect Such a delay could cause us to lose existing customers or fail to attract new customers This could cause a decline in our net revenues and net income and could adversely affect our results of operations Conversely if we hire and train too many technicians in anticipation of volume growth that does not materialize materializes at a rate slower than anticipated or if volumes decline our costs and expenditures may outpace our revenue growth harming our gross margins operating expenses and financial results Our information technology systems are critical to our business System integration and implementation issues and system security risks could disrupt our operations which could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results We rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems IT systems All IT systems are vulnerable to damage attack or interruption from a variety of sources As our business has grown in size and complexity the growth has placed and will continue to place significant demands on such systems To effectively manage this growth our IT systems and applications require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology evolving industry and regulatory standards increasingly sophisticated cyber threats and changing customer preferences Expanded remote working and increased customer usage of online technology platforms by us our customers and suppliers as a means to mitigate the spread of COVID19 have increased the demands on and risks to our IT systems and personnel Moreover we continue to transform certain business processes extend established processes to new subsidiaries andor implement additional functionality in our enterprise resource planning ERP software system which entails certain risks including disruption of our operations such as our ability to track orders and timely ship products manage our supply chain and aggregate financial and operational data System upgrades new releases and enhancements require significant expenditures and allocation of valuable employee resources Delays in integration or disruptions to our business from implementation of these new or upgraded systems could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results Additionally we continuously upgrade and issue new releases of our customer facing software applications such as my iTero our ClinCheck software MyAligntech and the Invisalign Doctor Site as well as our internal software applications upon which customer facing manufacturing and treatment planning operations are dependent Software applications frequently contain errors or defects especially when first introduced or when new versions are released The discovery of a defect error or security vulnerability in our software applications or IT systems incompatibility with customers computer operating systems and hardware configurations with a new release or upgraded version or the failure of our primary IT systems may cause adverse consequences including delay or loss of revenues delay in market acceptance damage to our reputation loss of market share or increased service costs any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 23 A significant portion of our clear aligner production is dependent on digital scans from our iTero and third party intraoral scanners A failure of all or any portion of ours or third party software or other components or systems to interoperate with iTero or third party scanners termination of interoperability with third party scanners or a system outage for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our ability to accept scans manufacture clear aligners or otherwise service our customers which may amongst other things harm our sales damage our reputation or result in litigation If the information we rely on to run our businesses is inaccurate or unreliable if we fail to properly maintain our IT systems and data integrity or if we fail to develop new capabilities to meet our business needs in a timely manner we could suffer operational disruptions have customer disputes and fail to produce timely and accurate reports We may also be required to respond to regulatory inquiries or actions forced to defend against litigation or pay damages penalties or fines experience increases in operating and administrative expenses find it necessary to rebuild networks or systems lose existing customers experience difficulties attracting new customers or implementing our growth strategies or suffer other adverse consequences In addition experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security or our cloudbased software servers hosted by third parties and misappropriate our confidential information or that of third parties expose personal and financial data of our customers and their patients create system disruptions or cause shutdowns Furthermore sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we either internally develop or procure from third parties may contain defects or present risks in design development manufacture or distribution including bugs security vulnerabilities and other problems that can unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system or compromise or exploit the safety and security of our networks The costs to eliminate or mitigate security problems viruses and bugs could be significant and depending on the nature and extent of the problem and the networks or products impacted may result in network or systems interruptions that may have a material adverse impact on our operations net revenues and operating results There can be no assurance that our process of improving existing or developing new IT systems integrating new IT systems protecting confidential patient health information and improving service levels will not be delayed or that additional IT systems issues will not arise in the future Failure to adequately protect and maintain the integrity of our IT systems and data may result in a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows If the security of our customer and patient information is compromised or we are unable to comply with data protection laws our operations may be severely adversely impacted patient care could suffer we could be liable for related damages and our reputation could be impaired We retain confidential customer financial as well as patient health information Therefore it is critical that the facilities and infrastructure on which we depend to run our business remain secure and are also perceived by the marketplace and our customers to be secure Despite the implementation of security measures we have experienced breaches in the past and the infrastructure and systems on which we depend may be vulnerable to physical breakins computer viruses programming errors or other technical malfunctions hacking or phishing attacks by third parties ransomware employee error or malfeasance or similar disruptive problems For example some companies have experienced an increase in phishing and social engineering attacks from third parties in connection with the COVID19 pandemic If we fail to meet our customer and patients expectations regarding the security of their information we could be liable for damages and our reputation and competitive position could be impaired Affected parties could initiate legal or regulatory action against us which could cause us to incur significant expense and liability or result in judicial or governmental orders forcing us to cease operations or modify our business practices in ways that could materially limit or restrict the products and services we provide Concerns over our privacy practices could adversely affect others perception of us and deter customers advertisers and partners from using our products In addition patient care could suffer and we could be liable if our IT systems fail to deliver correct information in a timely manner We have cybersecurity and other forms of insurance coverage related to a breach event covering expenses for notification credit monitoring investigation crisis management public relations and legal advice The policy also provides coverage for regulatory action defense including fines and penalties potential payment card industry fines and penalties and costs related to cyber extortion however damage and claims arising from such incidents may not be covered or may exceed the amount of any coverage We are also subject to federal state and foreign laws and regulations including ones relating to privacy data protection content regulation and consumer protection We may be or become subject to data localization or data residency laws which generally require that certain types of data collected within a country be stored and processed only within that country or approved countries Some countries including Brazil Russia and China have enacted and others are considering enacting data localization or data residency laws and we could be required to implement new or expand existing data storage protocols build new storage facilities andor devote additional resources to comply with the requirements of such laws any of which could have significant cost implications We may also be subject to data export restrictions or international transfer laws which prohibit or impose conditions upon the transfer of such data from one country to another These laws and regulations are constantly evolving and may be interpreted applied created or amended in a manner that could adversely affect our business 24 In addition we must comply with numerous data protection requirements that span from individual state and national laws in the US and China to multinational requirements in the EU For instance China has enacted new complex and highly restrictive cybersecurity data localization and cross border data transfer laws In the EU we must comply with the General Data Protection Regulation which serves as a harmonization of EU dataprivacy laws Maintaining compliance with these laws and regulations is costly and could require complex changes in the way we do business or provide services to our customers and their patients Additionally our success may be dependent on the success of healthcare providers in managing data protection requirements In order to deepen our market penetration and raise awareness of our brand and products we may increase the amount we spend on marketing activities which may not ultimately prove successful or an effective use of our resources Our marketing efforts and costs are significant and include national and regional campaigns involving television print media social media and more recently alliances with professional sports teams and other strategic partners We attempt to structure our advertising campaigns to increase brand awareness and adoption however there is no assurance our campaigns will achieve the returns on advertising spend desired or successfully increase brand or product awareness sufficiently to sustain or increase our growth goals which could have an adverse effect on our gross margin and business overall In addition various countries restrict direct to consumer advertising of our products and we could run afoul of restrictions and be ordered to stop certain marketing activities Our success depends in part on our proprietary technology and if we fail to successfully obtain or enforce our intellectual property rights our competitive position may be harmed Litigating claims of this type are costly and could distract our management and cause a decline in our results of operations and stock price Our success depends in part on our ability to maintain existing intellectual property IP rights and to obtain and maintain further IP protection for our products Our inability to do so could harm our competitive position We rely on our portfolio of issued and pending patent applications in the US and in other countries to protect a large part of our IP and our competitive position however our currently pending or future patent filings may not result in the issuance of patents Additionally any patents issued to us may be challenged invalidated held unenforceable circumvented or may not be sufficiently broad to prevent third parties from producing competing products similar in design to our products In addition any protection afforded by foreign patents may be more limited than that provided under US patents and IP laws Moreover our foreign patent portfolio is less extensive than our US portfolio We also rely on protection of our copyrights trademarks trade secrets knowhow and proprietary information We generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants and our collaborative partners upon commencement of a relationship with us however these agreements may not provide meaningful protection against the unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or other confidential information and adequate remedies may not exist if unauthorized use or disclosure were to occur Our inability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology through patents copyrights or trade secrets would impair our competitive advantages and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and future growth prospects In particular a failure to protect our proprietary rights might allow competitors to copy our technology which could adversely affect our pricing and market share In addition in an effort to protect our IP we are currently involved in litigation and expect to be in the future The potential effects on our business operations resulting from litigation whether or not ultimately determined in our favor or settled by us are costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from normal business operations Litigation interferences oppositions reexams inter partes reviews post grant reviews or other proceedings have been necessary and likely will be needed in the future to determine the validity and scope of certain of our IP rights and the IP rights claimed by third parties to determine the validity scope or noninfringement of certain patent rights pertinent to the manufacture use or sale of our products Any of these proceedings are unpredictable and may be protracted expensive and distracting to management The outcome of such proceedings could adversely affect the validity and scope of our patent or other proprietary rights hinder our ability to manufacture and market our products require us to seek a license for the infringed product or technology or result in the assessment of significant monetary damages An unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or in cases where injunctive relief is sought an injunction prohibiting us from selling our products Any of these results from our litigation could adversely affect our results of operations and stock price 25 Obtaining approvals and complying with governmental regulations particularly healthcare and data privacy compliance is expensive and timeconsuming and any failure to obtain or maintain approvals or comply with regulations regarding our products or services or the products and services of our suppliers or customers could materially harm our sales result in substantial penalties and cause harm to our reputation As a medical device company Align and many of our suppliers and customers are subject to extensive and frequently changing regulations under numerous federal state local and foreign laws Our healthcare provider customers and distributors are also subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations that affect the nature and scope of their relationships with us The healthcare market itself is highly regulated and subject to changing political economic and regulatory influences For instance regulations affecting the security and privacy of patient healthcare information held by healthcare providers and their business associates such as the US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act HIPAA may require us to make significant and unplanned enhancements of software applications or services result in delays or cancellations of orders or result in the revocation of endorsement of our products and services by healthcare participants Our critical vendors and service providers are similarly subject to various regulations Our failure or the failure of our suppliers or customers to strictly adhere to clearances or approvals in the labeling marketing and sales of our products and services could subject us to claims or litigation including actions alleging false or misleading advertising unfair or anticompetitive business practices or other violations of laws or regulations which may result in costly investigations fines penalties as well as material judgments settlements or decrees There can be no assurance that we will adequately address the business risks associated with the implementation and compliance with such laws or that we will be able to take advantage of any resulting business opportunities Furthermore in general before we can sell a new medical device or market a new use of or claim for an existing product we must obtain clearance or approval unless an exemption applies For instance in the US FDA regulations are wide ranging and govern among other things  product design development manufacturing and testing  product labeling  product storage  premarket clearance or approval  complaint handling and corrective actions  advertising and promotion and  product sales and distribution It takes significant time effort and expense to obtain and maintain FDA clearances or approvals of products and services In other countries the requirements to obtain and maintain similar approvals may differ materially from those of the FDA Moreover there is no guarantee we will successfully obtain or maintain approvals in all or any of the countries in which we do business now or in the future Even if successful the time and effort required may be significant and costly The impact of COVID19 on normal governmental operations may delay our efforts to obtain and maintain approvals possibly significantly If approvals to market our products or services are delayed whether in the US or other countries we may be unable to market our products or services in markets we deem important to our business Were any of these risks to occur our domestic or international operations may be materially harmed and our business as a whole adversely impacted In addition our failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in enforcement actions in the US and other countries For example enforcement actions by the FDA may include one or more of the following sanctions  warning letters fines injunctions consent decrees and civil penalties  repair replacement refunds recall or seizure of our products  operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production  refusing our requests for 510k clearance or premarket approval of new products new intended uses or modifications to existing products  withdrawing clearance or premarket approvals previously granted and  criminal prosecution We and certain of our vendors must also comply with facility registration and product listing requirements of the FDA and adhere to applicable Quality System regulations The FDA enforces its Quality System regulations through periodic unannounced inspections Our failure to satisfactorily correct an adverse inspection finding or to comply with applicable manufacturing regulations could result in enforcement actions and we may be required to find alternative manufacturers which could be a long and costly process Any enforcement action by the FDA or foreign governments could have a material adverse effect on us 26 In addition numerous foreign state and federal healthcarerelated laws regulate our business and the businesses of our customers suppliers and service providers covering areas such as  the storage transmission and disclosure of medical information and healthcare records  prohibitions against the offer payment or receipt of remuneration to induce referrals to entities providing healthcare services or goods or to induce the order purchase or recommendation of our products and  the marketing and advertising of our products The sourcing and availability of metals that may be used in the manufacture of or contained in our products may be affected by laws and regulations in the US or internationally regarding the use of minerals obtained from certain regions of the world like the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries These laws and regulations may decrease the number of suppliers capable of supplying our needs for certain metals thereby negatively affecting our ability to manufacture products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices We may furthermore suffer financial and reputational harm if customers require and we are unable to deliver certification that our products are conflict free Regardless compliance with these laws and regulations will require time and effort by our personnel and others and we will incur additional costs If we or any vendors on whose products or services we rely for our products and service infringe the patents or IP rights of other parties or are subject to a patent infringement claim our ability to grow our business may be severely limited Extensive litigation over patents and other IP rights is common in the medical device software 3D printing and other technologies and industries on which our products and services and based We have been sued for infringement of third partys patents in the past and we may be the subject of patent or other litigation in the future We periodically receive letters from third parties drawing our attention to their patent rights While we do not believe we infringe upon any valid and enforceable rights that have been brought to our attention there may be other more pertinent rights of which we are presently unaware The defense and prosecution of IP suits interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings could result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion of effort by our technical and management personnel An adverse determination of any litigation or interference proceeding to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liabilities exclusion orders or injunctions that may prevent or limit our rights to sell or import our products in one or more countries An adverse determination of this nature could also put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly or require us to seek licenses from third parties Licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all in which event our business would be materially adversely affected We maintain single supply relationships for certain key machines and materials and our business and operating results could be harmed if supply is restricted or ends or the price of raw materials used in our manufacturing process increases We are highly dependent on manufacturers of specialized scanning equipment rapid prototyping machines resin and other advanced materials as well as the optics electronic and other mechanical components of our intraoral scanners We maintain single supply relationships for many of these machines and materials In particular our CT scanning and stereolithography equipment used in our aligner manufacturing and many of the critical components for the optics of our scanners are provided by single suppliers We purchase the vast majority of our resin and polymer the primary raw materials used in our manufacturing process for clear aligners from a single source Moreover we rely on a thirdparty manufacturer to supply key subassemblies for our iTero Element scanner If these or other suppliers encounter financial operating or other difficulties are unable to hire or maintain personnel cannot timely obtain supplies are unable to maintain manufacturing standards or controls fail to timely deliver materials parts or components or if our relationship or the terms by which we contract with any of them changes we may be unable to quickly establish or qualify replacement sources of supply and could face production interruptions delays and inefficiencies Finding substitute manufacturers may be expensive timeconsuming or impossible and could result in a significant interruption in the supply of one or more products including our intraoral scanners causing us to lose revenues and suffer damage to our customer relationships In addition technology changes by our vendors could disrupt access to required manufacturing capacity or require expensive time consuming development efforts to adapt and integrate new equipment or processes Our growth may exceed the capacity of one or more of these manufacturers to produce the needed equipment and materials in sufficient quantities to support our growth Conversely in order to secure supplies for production of products we sometimes enter into noncancelable minimum purchase commitments with vendors which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to reflect declining market demands If demand for our products is less than we expect we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges and our profitability may suffer In the event of technology changes delivery delays or shortages of or increases in price for these items our business and growth prospects may be harmed 27 We primarily rely on our direct sales force to sell our products and any failure to train and maintain our key sales force personnel could harm our business Our ability to sell our products and generate revenues primarily depends upon our direct sales force within our Americas and International markets We do not have any longterm employment contracts with our direct sales force and the loss of the services of key personnel or groups of employees may harm our business In order to provide more comprehensive sales and service coverage and pursue growth opportunities we continue to increase the size of our sales force domestically and internationally Moreover as we focus on market penetration we have begun to segregate sales personnel to focus on specific markets such as orthodontists and GPs It can take up to twelve months or more to train sales representatives to successfully market and sell our products and for them to establish strong customer relationships If we are unable to expand our sales force retain our key sales personnel or quickly replace them with individuals of equivalent technical expertise and qualifications if we are unable to successfully instill technical expertise in new and existing sales representatives if we fail to establish and maintain strong relationships with our customers or if our efforts at specializing our selling techniques prove unsuccessful or not costeffective our net revenues and our ability to maintain market share could be materially harmed In addition due to our large and fragmented customer base we may not be able to provide all of our customers with product support immediately upon the launch of a new product As a result adoption of new products by our customers may be slower than anticipated and our ability to grow market share and increase our net revenues may be harmed We use distributors for a portion of the importation marketing and sales efforts related to our products and services which exposes us to risks that may be harmful to our sales and operations In addition to our direct sales force we have and expect to continue to use distributors to import market sell service andor support our products Our agreements with these distributors may be nonexclusive and terminable by either party with little notice If any of these relationships are terminated and alternative distributors are not quickly found and trained in the use marketing and sales of our products and services our revenues and ability to sell or service our products in markets key to our growth and expansion could be adversely affected These distributors may also choose to sell alternative or competing products or services In addition we may be held responsible for the actions of these distributors and their employees and agents for compliance with laws and regulations including competition bribery and corruption and medical device and services marketing and sales activities A distributor may also affect our ability to effectively market our products in certain foreign countries or regulatory jurisdictions if it holds the regulatory authorization in such countries or within such regions and causes by action or inaction the suspension of such marketing authorization or sanctions for noncompliance It may be difficult expensive and timeconsuming for us to reestablish market access or regulatory compliance in such cases Our business exposes us to potential liability for the quality and safety of our products and services how we advertise and market those products and services and how and to whom we sell them and we may incur substantial expenses or be liable for substantial damages or penalties if we are subject to claims or litigation Our products and services involve an inherent risk of claims concerning their design manufacture safety and performance how they are marketed and advertised in a complex framework of highly regulated domestic and international laws and regulations and how we package bundle or and sell them to customers who may be private individuals or companies or public entities such as hospitals and clinics Moreover consumer products and services are routinely subject to claims of false deceptive or misleading advertising consumer fraud and unfair business practices Additionally we may be held liable if any product we develop or manufacture or services we offer or perform causes injury or is otherwise found unhealthy or unsuitable Even if our products are safe if they are promoted for use or used in unintended or unexpected ways or for which we have not obtained clearance or approvals offlabel usage we may be investigated fined or have our products or services enjoined or clearances rescinded by administrative agencies or we may be required to defend ourselves in litigation Although we intend to continue to maintain insurance for product liability business practices and other types of activities we make or offer coverage may not be available on acceptable terms if at all and may not be sufficient against potential liabilities Any claim for product liability sales advertising and business practices regardless of its merit or eventual outcome could result in significant legal defense costs and damage our reputation increase our expenses and diverting managements attention away from the operation of our business We are subject to risks associated with our strategic investments Impairments in the value of our investments could negatively impact our financial results We have and expect to continue to make investments in promising research and technology primarily through privately held companies for strategic reasons and to support key business initiatives and we may not realize a return on our strategic investments Of the companies in which we invest they may generate net losses and the market for their products services or technologies may be slow to develop if at all Furthermore valuations of privately held companies are inherently complex due 28 to the lack of readily available market data If we determine that our investments have declined in value we may be required to record impairments which could be material and could have an adverse impact on our financial results General Risk Factors If we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain key personnel we may be unable to pursue business opportunities or develop our products We are highly dependent on the key employees in our clinical engineering technology development manufacturing sales training and marketing personnel and management teams The loss of the services provided by those individuals may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our product development and other business objectives and could harm our business Our future success also depends on our ability to identify recruit train and retain additional qualified personnel including orthodontists and production technicians in our treatment planning facilities Few orthodontists are accustomed to working in a manufacturing environment since they are generally trained to work in private practices universities and other research institutions Thus we may be unable to attract and retain personnel with the advanced qualifications necessary for the further development of our business Furthermore we may not be successful in retaining our key personnel or their services If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our business could be materially harmed Business disruptions could seriously harm our financial condition Our global operations may be disrupted by natural or human induced disasters including earthquakes tsunamis floods drought hurricanes typhoons wildfires extreme weather conditions power shortages telecommunications failures materials scarcity and price volatility and medical epidemics or health pandemics For instance the COVID19 pandemic and subsequent recovery materially adversely impacted our sales and business operations in 2020 the operations of our customers and the global economy overall Climate change may increase both the frequency and severity of natural disasters and consequently risks to our operations and growth The occurrence of business disruptions could harm our growth and expansion result in significant losses seriously harm our revenue profitability and financial condition adversely affect our competitive position increase our costs and expenses and require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations Our digital dental modeling is primarily processed in our facility located in San Jose Costa Rica The operations teams in Costa Rica and other global locations create ClinCheck treatment plans using sophisticated computer software In addition certain of our customer facing operations are located in Costa Rica Our aligner molds and finished aligners are fabricated in Mexico and China Both locations in Costa Rica and Mexico as well as others are in earthquake zones and may be subject to other natural disasters If there is a major earthquake or any other natural disaster in a region where one of these facilities is located our ability to create ClinCheck treatment plans respond to customer inquiries or manufacture and ship our aligners could be compromised which could result in our customers experiencing significant delays receiving their aligners and a decrease in service levels for a period of time Moreover a significant portion of our research and development activities are located in California which suffers from earthquakes periodic droughts and wildfires affecting the health and safety of our employees Any such business interruptions could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations Changes in or interpretations of accounting rules and regulations could result in unfavorable accounting charges We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP These principles are subject to interpretation by the SEC and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies A change in these policies or in the way these policies are interpreted by us or regulators can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even retroactively affect previously reported transactions We are required to annually assess our internal control over financial reporting and any adverse results from such assessment may result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price We routinely assess update and refine our internal control over financial reporting for its effectiveness Pursuant to the SarbanesOxley Act of 2002 and rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC we are required to furnish in our Form 10K a report by our management regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting The report includes among other things an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective This assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management Our internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions including changes in personnel updates and upgrades to existing software including our ERP software system changes in accounting standards or interpretations of existing standards and as a result the degree of compliance of our internal control over financial reporting with the existing policies or procedures may become ineffective Establishing testing and maintaining an effective system of internal control over financial 29 reporting requires significant resources and time commitments on the part of our management and our finance staff may require additional staffing and infrastructure investments and increases our costs of doing business If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective in any future period or if our auditors are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls or conclude that our internal controls are ineffective the timely filing of our financial reports could be delayed or we could be required to restate past reports and cause us to lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports in the future which could have an adverse effect on our stock price We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations Although the US dollar is our reporting currency a growing portion of our net revenues and net income are generated in foreign currencies Net revenues and net income generated by subsidiaries operating outside of the US are translated into US dollars using constantly fluctuating often substantially exchange rates As a result negative movements in exchange rates against the US dollar have and may increasingly adversely affect our net revenues and net income in our consolidated financial statements We enter into currency forward contract transactions in an effort to cover some of our exposure to currency fluctuations but there is no assurance these transactions will fully or effectively hedge our exposure to currency fluctuations and under certain circumstances these transactions could have an adverse effect on our financial condition If we fail to manage our exposure to global financial and securities market risk successfully our operating results and financial statements could be materially impacted The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal To achieve this objective a majority of our marketable investments are investment grade liquid fixedincome securities and money market instruments denominated in US dollars If the carrying value of an investment exceeds the fair value and the decline in fair value is deemed to be otherthantemporary we are required to write down the value of the investment which could materially harm our results of operations and financial condition Moreover the performance of certain securities in our investment portfolio correlates with the credit condition of the US financial sector In an unstable credit or economic environment it is necessary to assess the value of our investments more frequently and we might incur significant realized unrealized or impairment losses associated with these investments If our goodwill or longlived assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings Under GAAP we review our goodwill and longlived asset group for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable Additionally goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually The qualitative and quantitative analysis used to test goodwill are dependent upon various assumptions and reflect managements best estimates Changes in certain assumptions including revenue growth rates discount rates earnings multiples and future cash flows may cause a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of goodwill or the asset group may be impaired and assessing these assumptions and predicting and forecasting future events can be difficult Large acquisitions such as our acquisition of exocad in 2020 require ongoing fair value assessments of goodwill and purchased assets to determine if they have become impaired Consequently we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in the financial statements during the period in which any impairment of goodwill or longlived asset group is determined Our effective tax rate may vary significantly from period to period Various internal and external factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our future effective tax rate These factors include but are not limited to changes in global economic environment changes in legal entity structure or activities performed within our entities changes in tax laws regulations andor rates new or changes to accounting pronouncements changing interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations changes in the relative proportions of revenues and income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates changes in overall levels of pretax earnings the future levels of tax benefits of stockbased compensation settlement of income tax audits and nondeductible goodwill impairments For example our effective tax rate varied significantly in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 due to the relocation of our EMEA regional headquarters from the Netherlands to Switzerland Our effective tax rate is also dependent in part on forecasts of full year results which can vary materially Furthermore we may continue to experience significant variation in our effective tax rate related to excess tax benefits on stockbased compensation particularly in the first quarter of each year when the majority of our equity awards vest Changes in tax laws or tax rulings could negatively impact our income tax provision and net income As a US multinational corporation we are subject to changing tax laws both within and outside of the US Changes in tax laws or tax rulings or changes in interpretations of existing tax laws could affect our income tax provision and net income 30 or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business In addition governmental tax authorities are increasingly scrutinizing the tax positions of companies Many countries in Europe as well as a number of other countries and organizations have recently proposed or recommended changes to existing tax laws or have enacted new laws For example the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD has been working on a Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project which is focused on a number of issues including the shifting of profits between affiliated entities in different tax jurisdictions The OECD has issued and is expected to continue to issue guidelines and proposals that may change various aspects of the existing framework under which our tax obligations are determined in many of the countries in which we do business We may acquire other businesses products or technologies in the future which could require significant management attention disrupt our business dilute shareholder value and adversely affect our results of operations Periodically we may acquire or make investments in complementary companies products or technologies like our acquisition of exocad in 2020 Alternatively we may be unable to find suitable acquisition targets in the future and we may not be able to complete acquisitions on favorable terms if at all If we do complete acquisitions we may not ultimately strengthen our competitive position or achieve our goals or desired synergies and any acquisitions we complete could be viewed negatively by our customers securities analysts and investors Additionally as an organization we do not have a history of significant acquisitions or integrating their operations and cultures with our own If we fail to successfully integrate any acquisitions or the technologies acquired our revenue and results of operations could be adversely affected or we may inherit or fail to uncover material issues of the acquired company or assets including litigation or ongoing investigations accounting irregularities or improprieties failure to comply with regulations governmental orders or decrees and IT security and privacy compliance issues Any integration process may require significant time and resources and we may not successfully evaluate or utilize the acquired technology or we may fail to retain key personnel or accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquired business We may have to pay cash incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any acquisition any of which could adversely affect our liquidity financial condition or the value of our common stock The sale of equity or issuance of debt to finance any acquisition could result in dilution to our shareholders The occurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could also include covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations Moreover opposition to one of more acquisitions could lead to negative ratings by analysts or investors give rise objections by one or more stockholders or result in shareholder activism any of which could harm our stock price Acquisitions can also lead to large noncash charges that can have an adverse effect on our results of operations as a result of writeoffs for items such as future impairments of intangible assets and goodwill or the recording of stockbased compensation Historically the market price for our common stock has been volatile The market price of our common stock is subject to wide price fluctuations in response to various factors many of which are beyond our control The factors include  the impact on global and regional economies as a result of the COVID19 pandemic  quarterly variations in our results of operations and liquidity or changes in our forecasts and guidance  changes in recommendations by the investment community or their estimates of our net revenues or operating results  speculation in the press or investment community concerning our business and results of operations  announcements by us or our competitors or new market entrants including strategic actions management changes and material transactions or acquisitions  technical factors in the public trading market for our stock that may produce price movements that may or may not comport with macro industry or companyspecific fundamentals including without limitation the sentiment of retail investors including as it may be expressed on financial trading and other social media sites the amount and status of short interest in our securities access to margin debt trading in options and other derivatives on our common stock fractional share trading and other technical trading factors or strategies  announcements regarding stock repurchases sales of our common stock credit agreements and debt issuances  announcements of technological innovations or new products or product offerings by us our customers or competitors  key decisions in pending litigation  sales of stock by us our officers or directors and  general economic market conditions In addition the stock market in general and the market for technology and medical device companies in particular have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated to or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies These broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance Historically class action litigation is often brought against an issuing company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities and we have not been excepted from such litigation 31 We cannot guarantee we will repurchase our common stock again in the future and any repurchases may not achieve our objectives Although we have not repurchased any of our common stock recently we have a history of recurring stock repurchase programs intended to return capital to our investors Any authorization or continuance of our share repurchase programs is contingent on a variety of factors including our financial condition results of operations business requirements and our board of directors continuing determination that share repurchases are in the best interests of our stockholders and in compliance with all applicable laws and agreements There is no assurance that we will resume repurchases of our common stock or continue repurchasing our common stock if we do resume consistent with historical levels or at all or that our stock repurchase programs will have a beneficial impact on our stock price Future sales of significant amounts of our common stock may depress our stock price A large percentage of our outstanding common stock is currently owned by a small number of significant stockholders These stockholders have sold in the past and may sell in the future large amounts of common stock over relatively short periods of time Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market by existing stockholders may adversely affect the market price of our common stock by creating the perception of difficulties or problems with our business that may depress our stock
