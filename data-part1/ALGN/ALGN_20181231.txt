management and support including nonclinical operations and we sell directly to dental laboratories who manufacture or customize a variety of products to assist in the provision of oral health care by a licensed dentist Our Clear Aligner operating segment includes revenues from nonInvisalign aligners supplied to SmileDirectClub LLC SDC Refer to Supply Agreement with SmileDirectClub LLC section We received 510k clearance from the United States Food and Drug Administration FDA to market the Invisalign System in 1998 The Invisalign System is regulated by the FDA as a Class II medical device In order to provide Invisalign treatment to their patients orthodontists and GPs must initially complete an Invisalign training course The Invisalign System is sold primarily through a direct sales force in North America Asia Pacific APAC Europe Middle East and Africa EMEA and Latin America To date over 61 million people worldwide have been treated with our Invisalign System Our iTero scanner is used by dental professionals andor labs and service providers for restorative and orthodontic digital procedures as well as Invisalign case submission We received 510k clearance from the FDA to market iTero software for expanded indications in 2013 Scanners and computeraided designcomputeraided manufacturing CADCAM services are primarily sold through our direct sales force and a few distributors in North America Europe and certain Asia Pacific countries and through distribution partners in smaller noncore international country markets 3 Clear Aligner Segment Malocclusion and Traditional Orthodontic Treatment Malocclusion or the misalignment of teeth is one of the most prevalent clinical dental conditions affecting billions of people or approximately 60 to 75 of the population Annually approximately 12 million people in major developed countries elect treatment by orthodontists worldwide Most orthodontic patients are treated with the use of traditional methods such as metal arch wires and brackets referred to as braces and may be augmented with elastics metal expanders headgear or functional appliances and other ancillary devices as needed Upon completion of the treatment the dental professional may at his or her discretion have the patient use a retainer appliance Of the 12 million annual orthodontic cases started approximately 75 or 84 million are applicable to Invisalign treatment our served market In addition approximately 300 million people with malocclusion could benefit from straightening their teeth but are unlikely to seek treatment through a doctors office This represents an incremental opportunity for us as we expand the market for orthodontics by educating more consumers about the benefits of straighter teeth using Invisalign clear aligners and connect them with an Invisalign doctor of their choice The Invisalign System The Invisalign System is a proprietary method for treating malocclusion based on a proprietary computersimulated virtual treatment plan and a series of doctorprescribed custom manufactured clear plastic removable aligners The Invisalign System offers a range of treatment options specialized services and proprietary software for treatment visualization and is comprised of the following phases Orthodontic diagnosis and transmission of treatment data to us  The Invisaligntrained dental professional prepares and sends us a patients treatment data package which consists of a prescription form a digital scan or a polyvinylsiloxane or PVS impression of the relevant dental arches photographs of the patient and at the dental professionals election xrays of the patients dentition Intraoral digital scans may be submitted through either Aligns iTero scanner or a few qualified thirdparty scanners See Third Party Scanners and Digital scans for Invisalign treatment submission More than 63 of Invisalign case submissions are submitted via digital scan instead of a physical PVS impression Preparation of computersimulated treatment plan  Using propriety software which we do not sell we generate a proposed custom threedimensional treatment plan called a ClinCheck treatment plan The ClinCheck treatment plan simulates appropriate tooth movement in stages and details timing and placement of any features or attachments that will be used during treatment Attachments are toothcolored buttons that are sometimes used to increase the biomechanical force on a specific tooth or teeth in order to effect the desired movements Review and approval of the treatment plan by an Invisaligntrained doctor The patients ClinCheck treatment plan is then made available to the prescribing dental professional via the Invisalign Doctor Site which enables the dental professional to project tooth movement with a level of accuracy not previously possible with metal arch wires and brackets By reviewing modifying as needed and approving the treatment plan the dental professional retains control over the treatment plan Manufacture of custom aligners Upon the dental professionals approval of the ClinCheck treatment plan we use the data underlying the simulation in conjunction with stereolithography technology a form of 3D printing technology to construct a series of molds depicting the future position of the patients teeth Each mold is a replica of the patients teeth at each stage of the simulated course of treatment From these molds aligners are fabricated by pressureforming polymeric sheets over each mold Aligners are thin clear plastic removable dental appliances that are custom manufactured in a series to correspond to each stage of the ClinCheck treatment plan Shipment to the dental professional and patient aligner wear All the aligners for a patient are shipped directly to the dental professional who then dispenses them to the patient at regular checkup intervals throughout the treatment Aligners are generally worn for a period of time which correspond to the stages of the approved ClinCheck treatment plan The patient replaces the aligners with the next pair in the series when prescribed advancing tooth movement with each aligner stage Throughout treatment the doctor may place attachments or use other auxiliaries to achieve desired tooth movements per the doctors original prescription and resulting ClinCheck treatment plan In October 2016 we introduced oneweek aligner wear At the treating doctors discretion weekly aligner changes are recommended for all Invisalign treatments for Invisalign Comprehensive Invisalign First Comprehensive Invisalign Lite Invisalign Assist and Invisalign Go packages thereby reducing treatment time by up to 50 compared to two week aligner wear Additional aligners  Should the dental professional determine that the treatment is not tracking for various reasons such as patient compliance certain teeth movement not tracking to plan or they need to extend the treatment a few stages further to 4 achieve their treatment goals the dental professional can request additional aligners at any point during the treatment subject to certain requirements in our terms and conditions Clear Aligner Products Comprehensive Products  Invisalign Treatment Options Invisalign Comprehensive  Invisalign Comprehensive Package replaces both Invisalign Full and Invisalign Teen treatments and includes the Mandibular Advancement feature launched in March 2017 Used for a wide range of malocclusion the Invisalign Comprehensive treatment plans each consist of the number of aligners necessary to achieve the doctors treatment goals The Invisalign Comprehensive treatment includes all the features of Invisalign treatment plus additional features that address the orthodontic needs of teenage patients such as compliance indicators compensation for tooth eruption Aligners for Invisalign Comprehensive treatments are manufactured and then delivered to the dental professionals in a single

simultaneously aligning the teeth without the need for elastics typically used to treat teen Class II patients In 2017 it was available in Canada core country markets in EMEA and certain country markets in APAC and Latin America In October 2018 Invisalign Treatment with mandibular advancement was approved by the FDA and became commercially available in the US in November 2018 In November 2018 we introduced enhancements designed to improve clinical outcomes and user experience including wing overlap and engagement in deep bite cases with anterior intrusion new options to set up mandibular advancement cases beyond edgetoedge an option to prescribe symmetrical advancement of the left and right side new default protocol of 2 mm incremental advancement and improvements to support leveling the curve of Spee in deep bite cases SmartTrack  Aligner Material SmartTrack is a patented customengineered Invisalign clear aligner material that delivers gentle more constant force considered ideal for orthodontic tooth movements Conventional aligner materials relax and lose a substantial percent of energy in the initial days of aligner wear but SmartTrack maintains more constant force over the period of time the patient wears the aligners The flexible SmartTrack material also more precisely conforms to tooth morphology attachments and interproximal spaces to improve control of tooth movement throughout treatment NonInvisalign Aligners Supplied to SmileDirectClub LLC SmileDirectClub Aligners On July 25 2016 we entered into a supply agreement with SmileDirectClub LLC SDC to manufacture nonInvisalign clear aligners for SDCs doctorled athome program for simple teeth straightening In October 2016 we became SDCs exclusive thirdparty supplier and began supplying aligners directly to SDC SDC aligners include up to 20 stages without attachments or interproximal reduction IPR Align manufactures the aligners per SDCs specifications for minor tooth movement using EX30 a nonproprietary aligner material used prior to the introduction of SmartTrack aligner material Align does not market or sell SDC products and ships supply of aligners directly to SDC when requested While we are SDCs only thirdparty supplier SDC also manufactures their own aligners The supply agreement terminates by its terms December 31 2019 and we do not intend on renewing it  Refer to Note 8 Legal Proceedings of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for details on SDC dispute Scanner Segment Intraoral scanning is an emerging technology that we believe will have substantial impact on the future of dentistry By enabling the dental practitioner to create a 3D image of the patients teeth digital scan using a handheld intraoral scanner inside the mouth digital scanning is more efficient and precise and more comfortable for patients compared to the discomfort and subjective nature of taking physical impressions The digitally scanned model is more accurate than a physical impression and substantially reduces the rate of restoration remakes so patients are recalled less often and the appointment time for the restoration is shorter because of fewer adjustments which results in greater overall patient satisfaction The digital model file can be used for various procedures and services including fabrication of physical dental models for use by labs to create restorative units such as veneers inlays onlays crowns bridges and implant abutments digital records storage orthodontic diagnosis orthodontic retainers and appliances and Invisalign digital impression submission iTero Scanner  The iTero Element scanner launched in September 2015 is available as a single hardware platform with software options for restorative or orthodontic procedures The expanded portfolio launched in May 2018 includes the iTero Element 2 and the iTero element Flex scanners These additions build on the existing high precision fullcolor imaging and fast scan times of the iTero Element portfolio The nextgeneration iTero Element 2 is designed for greater performance with 2X faster startup and 25 faster scan processing time compared to the iTero Element The iTero Element Flex is a wandonly device that transforms compatible laptop computers into a highly portable scanner that works anywhere  its ideal for practices with multiple locations who need a scanner that is convenient and easy to transport We market and sell the iTero Element in North America and in select international markets iTero Element 2 and iTero Element Flex scanners are available in the US Canada the majority of European countries including France Germany Italy Spain and the United Kingdom as well as select Asia Pacific markets The iTero scanner is interoperable with our Invisalign treatment such that a full arch digital scan can be submitted as part of the Invisalign case submission process In addition the Invisalign Outcome Simulator and Invisalign Assessment tool are exclusive to the iTero scanner Prior to the launch of iTero Element 2 and iTero Element Flex we sold and continue to sell iTero Element and prior to that we sold the iTero 29 scanner On February 18 2019 we launched the iTero Element 5D Imaging system which provides a new comprehensive approach to clinical applications workflows and user experience that expands the suite of existing highprecision

Products  We also sell other ancillary products for the iTero scanner such as disposable sleeves for the wand Third Party Scanners and Digital scans for Invisalign treatment submission  We support an open systems approach to digital scans and other intraoral scanning companies interested in qualifying their scanners to submit a digital impression in place of a traditional PVS impression as part of the Invisalign case submission process We have qualified third party scanners for digital scan submission including 3M True Definition scanner and the Sirona CEREC Omnicam scanner Information regarding legal proceedings associated with the scanner may be found in Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10K under the heading Legal Proceedings iTero Applications and Tools Invisalign Outcome Simulator  The Invisalign Outcome Simulator is an exclusive chairside and cloudbased application for the iTero scanner that allows doctors to help patients visualize how their teeth may look at the end of Invisalign treatment through a dual view layout that shows a prospective patient an image of hisher own current dentition next to hisher simulated final position after Invisalign treatment Invisalign 3D Assessment tool The Invisalign Progress Assessment tool provides the ability to compare a patients new scan with a specific stage of their ClinCheck treatment plan to visually assess and communicate Invisalign treatment progress with an easy to read colorcoded tooth movement report that allows the doctor to know how each tooth is tracking TimeLapse TimeLapse technology allows doctors or practitioners to compare a patients historic 3D scans to the presentday scan enabling clinicians to identify and measure orthodontic movement tooth wear and gingival recession This highlights areas of diagnostic interest to dental professionals and helps foster a proactive conversation with the patient regarding potential restorative or orthodontic solutions Our iTero Element iTero Element 2 and iTero Element Flex scanners include the Invisalign Outcome Simulator Invisalign 3D Assessment tool and Timelapse as well as the orthodontic software andor restorative software The orthodontic or restorative software may also be purchased subsequently for an upgrade fee Additional applications such as the Invisalign Outcome Simulator are not available for sale separately 7 Other proprietary software mentioned in this Annual Report on Form 10K such as ClinCheck and ClinCheck Pro software the Invisalign Doctor Site and feature enhancements are included as part of the Invisalign System and are not sold separately nor do they contribute as individual items to revenue Business Strategy Our goal is to establish the Invisalign System as the standard method for treating malocclusion and our intraoral scanning platform as the preferred scanning protocol for digital scans Our technology and innovations are designed to meet the demands of todays patients with treatment options that are convenient comfortable affordable while helping to improve overall oral health We strive to help our doctors move their practices forward by connecting them with new patients providing digital solutions to help increase practice efficiency and helping them deliver the best possible treatment outcomes and experiences to millions of people around the world We achieve this by continued focus and execution of our strategic growth drivers 1 International Expansion In order to provide the millions of consumers access to a better smile we continue increasing our presence globally by making our products available in more countries We expect to continue to grow and expand our business by investing in resources infrastructure and initiatives that will drive Invisalign treatment growth in our current and new international markets As our core countries within the EMEA and APAC regions continue to grow in both number of new Invisalign trained doctors and customer utilization we strive to make sure we can support that growth through investments such as headcount clinical support education and advertising We have transitioned most of our smaller country markets from an indirect to a direct sales model and while we do not expect a material impact from these countries for some time in the near term we will leverage our existing infrastructure in adjacent country markets as we build local sales organizations to drive longterm market penetration In addition we are scaling and expanding our operations and facilities to better support our customers across the globe In 2018 we opened new treatment planning facilities in Madrid Spain to support our customers within this region and we expanded our facilities in Costa Rica to support our growth 2 Orthodontist Utilization We continue to innovate and increase the product applicability and predictability to address a wide range of cases from simple to complex thereby enabling doctors to confidently treat teenagers and adults with the Invisalign System Over the last several years we launched clinical innovations such as Invisalign G6 and Invisalign G7 In March 2017 we launched Invisalign Comprehensive with Mandibular Advancement the first clear aligner solution for Class II correction in growing tween and teen patients in Canada and certain country markets in EMEA and APAC This offering combines the benefits of our clear aligner system with features for moving the lower jaw forward while simultaneously aligning the teeth Approximately 30 to 45 of teen cases need Class II correction In October 2018 we received 510k approval for Invisalign with Mandibular Advancement in the US and began its commercial launch in November 2018 We also continue to make improvements to our Invisalign treatment software ClinCheck Pro designed to deliver an exceptional user experience and increase treatment control to help our doctors achieve their treatment goals 3 GP Dentist Treat  Refer We want to enable GPs who have access to a large patient base to more easily identify Invisalign cases they can treat monitor patient progress or if needed help refer cases to an orthodontist while providing highquality restorative orthodontic and dental hygiene care In 2018 we continued to commercialize Invisalign Go a simplified and streamlined solution designed for GPs and trained over 3000 new iGo doctors primarily in EMEA In the EMEA region we segmented sales and marketing for certain country markets into two separate organizations to serve each customer segment orthodontists and GP dentists separately thereby increasing our focus and effectiveness on GP dentists In the first quarter of 2019 we plan to add 50 new sales representatives in EMEA to cover the GP dentist channel The iTero scanner is an important component to that customer experience and is central to a digital approach as well as overall customer utilization of Invisalign treatment The iTero scanner is optimized for Invisalign treatment with the Invisalign Outcome Simulator and Progress Assessment tool In June 2017 we launched TimeLapse technology that allows doctors or practitioners to compare a patients 3D historic scans to the presentday scan enabling clinicians to identify and measure orthodontic movement tooth wear and gingival recession This highlights areas of diagnostic interest to dental professionals and helps foster a proactive conversation with the patient regarding potential restorative or orthodontic solutions In 2018 we announced multiyear agreements with Heartland Dental and Aspen Dental two large dental support organizations to extend iTero Element intraoral scanners to their supported dentists and teams nationwide 8 4 Patient Demand  Conversion Our goal is to make Invisalign a highly recognized name brand worldwide by creating awareness for Invisalign treatment among consumers and motivating potential patients to seek Invisalign treatment We accomplish this objective through an integrated consumer marketing strategy that includes television media social networking and event marketing as well as educating patients on treatment options and directing them to high volume Invisalign doctors In January 2017 we launched a new Smile Concierge program with the objective to help more US consumers start Invisalign treatment and improve their overall experience by shortening their research cycles and utilizing consumer insights to help our doctors better engage with consumers Our Smile Concierge program educates consumers on the benefits of Invisalign treatment answers their questions and helps them schedule an appointment with an Invisalign doctor In addition the Invisalign Experience program reflects the Companys overarching approach to engaging consumers through brand experiences in consumerbased settings and environments Through the Invisalign Experience program were learning more than ever about reducing barriers to treatment for potential patients so that they are excited about getting a better smile with an Invisalign doctor In 2018 we expanded the interactive brand experience that was piloted in 2017 and finished the year with twelve Invisalign Experience locations in major US cities The program expansion is designed to address the rapidly evolving consumer market for clear aligners and connects consumers interested in Invisalign treatment with Invisalign doctors in their communities We also partnered with a few Invisalign doctors in select US cities piloting doctorowned Invisalign Experience centers to test new ways to reach consumers and connect them directly with doctors to start Invisalign treatment This pilot is intended to help doctors integrate consumerfriendly design and consultation workflow into their practices and test the new Invisalign Experience branding and a consumerfocused approach to consultations and Invisalign treatment starts It includes an initial digital scan and smile visualization with a scanner and immediate appointments for walkins In addition to providing potential leads to participating Invisalign practices we are seeing a positive halo effect and increased growth rates for all of the Invisalign practices in the surrounding area whether they participate in the location network or not While we are still early in the development of our Invisalign Experience locations and the overarching Invisalign Experience program we believe it will have a positive impact on demand creation for Invisalign practices by engaging directly with consumers Refer to Note 8 Legal Proceedings of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a communication received from SDC on the Invisalign Experience program Manufacturing and Suppliers Our manufacturing facilities are located in Juarez Mexico and Ziyang China where we conduct our aligner fabrication distribute and repair our scanners and perform our CADCAM services and in Or Yehuda Israel where we produce our handheld intraoral scanner wand and perform the final assembly of our iTero scanner Our Invisalign digital treatment planning and interpretation for iTero restorative cases are conducted at our facilities located in San Jose Costa Rica Chengdu China Cologne Germany and Madrid Spain Information regarding risks associated with our manufacturing process and foreign operations may be found in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10K under the heading Risk Factors Our quality system is required to be in compliance with the Quality System regulations enforced by the FDA and similar regulations enforced by other worldwide regulatory authorities We are certified to EN ISO 134852003 an internationally recognized standard for medical device manufacturing We have a formal documented quality system by which quality objectives are defined understood and achieved Systems processes and procedures are implemented to ensure high levels of product and service quality We monitor the effectiveness of the quality system based on internal data and direct customer feedback and strive to continually improve our systems and processes taking corrective action as needed Since the manufacturing process of our products requires substantial and varied technical expertise we believe that our manufacturing capabilities are important to our success In order to produce our highly customized highly precise medical quality products in volume we have developed a number of proprietary processes and technologies These technologies include complex software algorithms and solutions CT scanning stereolithography and automated aligner fabrication To increase the efficiency of our manufacturing processes we continue to focus our efforts on software development and the improvement of ratelimiting processes or bottlenecks We continuously upgrade our proprietary threedimensional treatment planning software to enhance computer analysis of treatment data and to reduce time spent on manual and judgmental tasks for each case thereby increasing the efficiency of our technicians In addition to improve efficiency and increase the scale of our operations we continue to invest in the development of automated systems for the fabrication and packaging of aligners We are highly dependent on manufacturers of specialized scanning equipment rapid prototyping machines resin and other advanced materials for our aligners as well as the optics electronic and other mechanical components of our intraoral scanners We maintain single supply relationships for many of these machines and materials technologies In particular our CT scanning and stereolithography equipment used in our aligner manufacturing and many of the critical components for the optics of our intraoral scanners are provided by single suppliers We are also committed to purchasing all of our resin and polymer the primary raw 9 materials used in our manufacturing process for clear aligners from a single source The need to replace one of our single source suppliers could cause a disruption in our ability to timely deliver certain of our products or increase costs See Item 1A Risk Factors  We maintain single supply relationships for certain of our key machines and materials technologies and our business and operating results could be harmed if supply is restricted or ends or the price of raw materials used in our manufacturing process increases Sales and Marketing Our sales efforts are focused primarily on the Invisalign System and continuing to increase adoption and utilization by orthodontists and GPs worldwide In North America Europe certain Asia Pacific country markets and more recently in Brazil and certain countries in the Middle East and Africa we have direct sales and support organizations which includes quota carrying sales representatives sales management and sales administration We also have distribution partners that sell the Invisalign System in smaller noncore international country markets We continued to expand in our existing markets through targeted investments in sales resources professional marketing and education programs along with consumer marketing in select country markets For the iTero scanner we have a small team of direct sales representatives and a few distributors in North America who leverage leads generated by our Invisalign sales and marketing resources including customer events and industry tradeshows We sell the iTero scanner in select country markets internationally and will expand to additional markets over time to grow the scanner business We provide training marketing and clinical support to orthodontists and GPs As of December 31 2018  we had approximately 69940 active Invisalign trained doctors which is defined as having submitted at least one case in the prior 12 month period Research and Development We are committed to investing in worldclass technology development which we believe is critical to achieving our goal of establishing the Invisalign System as the standard method for treating malocclusion and our intraoral scanning platform as the preferred scanning protocol for digital scans Our research and development activities are directed toward developing the technology innovations that we believe will deliver our next generation of products and platforms These activities range from accelerating product and clinical innovation to developing manufacturing process improvements to researching future technologies and products In an effort to demonstrate Invisaligns broad treatment capabilities various clinical case studies and articles have been published that highlight the clinical applicability of Invisalign to malocclusion cases including those of severe complexity We undertake precommercialization trials and testing of our technological improvements to the product and manufacturing process Intellectual Property We believe our intellectual property position represents a substantial business advantage As of December 31 2018  we had 449 active US patents 423 active foreign patents and 486 pending global patent applications Our active US patents expire between 2019 and 2037 When patents expire we lose the protection and competitive advantages they provided to us which could negatively impact our operating results however we continue to pursue further intellectual property protection through US and foreign patent applications and nondisclosure agreements We also seek to protect our software documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws We cannot be certain that patents will be issued as a result of any patent application or that patents that have been issued to us or that may be issued in the future will be found to be valid and enforceable and sufficient to protect our technology or products Our intellectual property rights may not be successfully asserted in the future or may be invalidated circumvented or challenged In addition the laws of various foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as US laws Our inability to protect our proprietary information could harm our business Information regarding risks associated with failing to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights may be found in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10K under the heading Risk Factors 10 Seasonal Fluctuations General economic conditions impact our business and financial results and we experience seasonal trends within our two operating segments customer channels and the geographic locations that we serve Sales of Invisalign treatments are often weaker in Europe during the summer months due to our customers and their patients being on holiday Similarly other international holidays like Chinese New Year can also negatively impact our sales In North America summer is typically the busiest season for orthodontists with practices that have a high percentage of adolescent and teenage patients as many parents want to get their teenagers started in treatment before the start of the school year however many GPs are on vacation during this time and therefore tend to start fewer cases For our Scanner segment capital equipment sales are often stronger in the fourth calendar quarter Consequently these seasonal trends have caused and may continue to cause fluctuations in our quarterly results including fluctuations in sequential revenue growth rates Backlog All Invisalign treatments are individually unique and prescribed by a doctor so no two cases are alike The period from which a treatment data package or a case is received until the acceptance of the digital ClinCheck treatment plan is dependent on the dental professionals discretion to modify accept or cancel the treatment plan Therefore we consider the case a firm order to manufacture aligners once the dental professional has approved the ClinCheck treatment plan Our Invisalign backlog consists of ClinCheck treatment plans that have been accepted but not yet shipped Because aligners are shipped shortly after the ClinCheck treatment plan has been accepted we believe that backlog is not a good indicator of future Invisalign revenues Our quarterly Invisalign revenues can be impacted by the timing of the ClinCheck treatment plan acceptances and our ability to ship those cases in the same quarter We define our intraoral scanner backlog as orders where credit and financing is approved and payment is reasonably assured but the scanner has not yet shipped Our intraoral scanner backlog as of December 31 2018 was not material to the business as a whole Competition Currently our products compete directly against products manufactured and distributed by various companies both within and outside the US Although the number of competitors varies by segment geography and customer we encounter a wide variety of competitors including wellestablished regional competitors in certain foreign markets as well as larger companies or divisions of larger companies with substantial sales marketing research and financial capabilities Due in part to the expiration of certain key patents owned by us beginning in 2017 we are facing increased competition in the clear aligner market markets as a result of the entry of new large companies into certain markets who have the ability to leverage their existing channels in the dental market to compete directly with us In addition corresponding foreign patents started to expire in 2018 and will likely result in increased competition in some of the markets outside the US Furthermore we also face competition from companies that now offer clear aligners directly to the consumer and do not require the consumer to see a doctor before or during orthodontic treatment Unlike these direct to consumer competitors we are committed to a doctor in the core of everything we do and Invisalign Treatment requires a doctors prescription and an in person physical examination of the patients dentition before treatment can begin Information regarding risks associated with increased competition may be found in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10K under the heading  Risk Factors  Key competitive factors include  effectiveness of treatment  price  software features  aesthetic appeal of the treatment method  customer support  customer online interface  brand awareness  innovation  distribution network  comfort associated with the treatment method  oral hygiene 11  ease of use and  dental professionals chair time We believe that our products compare favorably with our competitors products with respect to each of these factors Government Regulation In order for us to market our products we must obtain regulatory authorization and comply with extensive product and quality system regulations both within and outside the US These regulations including the requirements for approvals or clearance and the time required for regulatory review vary from country to country Failure to obtain regulatory approval and to meet all local requirements including language and specific safety standards in any country in which we currently market or plan to market our products could prevent us from marketing products in such countries or subject us to sanctions and fines The approval by government authorities is unpredictable and uncertain and may not be granted on a timely basis if at all Delays in receipt of or a failure to receive such approvals or clearances or the loss of any previously received approvals or clearances could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations Certain of our products are classified as medical devices under the US Food Drug and Cosmetic Act FDCA The FDCA requires these products when sold in the US to be safe and effective for their intended use and to comply with the regulations administered by the FDA Our products may also be regulated by comparable agencies in nonUS countries in which they are produced or sold In the European Union EU our products are subject to the medical devices laws of the various member states which are based on a Directive of the European Commission which was updated in April 2017 to the Medical Device Regulation Such laws generally regulate the safety of the products in a similar way to the FDA regulations We believe we are in compliance with all FDA federal and state laws and international regulatory requirements that are applicable to our products and manufacturing operations We are also subject to various laws inside and outside the US concerning our relationships with healthcare professionals and government officials price reporting and regulation the promotion sales and marketing of our products and services the importation and exportation of our products the operation of our facilities and distribution of our products As a global company we are subject to varying degrees of government regulation in the various countries in which we do business and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent oversight and enforcement Initiatives sponsored by government agencies legislative bodies and the private sector to limit the growth of healthcare expenses generally are ongoing in markets where we do business It is not possible to predict at this time the longterm impact of such cost containment measures on our future business Our customers are healthcare providers that may be reimbursed by federal funded programs such as Medicaid or a foreign national healthcare program each of which may offer some degree of oversight Many government agencies both domestic and foreign have increased their enforcement activities with respect to healthcare providers and companies in recent years Enforcement actions and associated defense can be expensive and any resulting findings carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties In addition we must comply with numerous data protection requirements that span from individual state and national laws in the US to multinational requirements in the EU In the US final regulations implementing amendments to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 HIPAA became effective in the latter part of 2013 with the HIPAA Omnibus Rule Align is also preparing for compliance with the recently passed California Consumer Privacy Act CCPA scheduled to take effect in January 2020 In the EU Align must comply with the General Data Protection Regulation GDPR which serves as a harmonization of European dataprivacy laws The GDPR went into effect May 25 2018 Further expansion into Latin American markets require Align to prepare for Brazils Lei Geral de Proteo de Dados LGPD scheduled to take effect in August 2020 Meanwhile the Asia Pacific region has also seen rapid development of privacy laws including Russia China South Korea Singapore Hong Kong and Australia We believe we have designed our product and service offerings to be compliant with the requirements of applicable data protection laws and regulations Maintaining systems that are compliant with these laws and regulations is costly and could require complex changes in the way we do business or provide services to our customers and their patients Additionally our success may be dependent on the success of healthcare providers in managing data protection requirements 12 Employees As of December 31 2018  we had approximately 11660 employees including 7580 in manufacturing and operations 2320 in sales and marketing which includes customer care 700 in research and development and 1060 in general and administrative functions Available Information Our website is

Process Development for Metra Biosystems Inc ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS We depend on the sale of the Invisalign System for the vast majority of our net revenues and any decline in sales of Invisalign treatment for any reason or a decline in average selling prices would adversely affect net revenues gross margin and net income We expect that net revenues from the sale of the Invisalign System primarily our comprehensive products will continue to account for the vast majority of our total net revenues for the foreseeable future Continued and widespread market acceptance of Invisalign by orthodontists GPs and consumers is critical to our future success If orthodontists and GPs experience a reduction in consumer demand for orthodontic services if consumers prove unwilling to adopt Invisalign as rapidly as we anticipate or in the volume that we anticipate if orthodontists or GPs choose to use a competitive product rather than Invisalign or if the average selling price of our product declines for any reason including as a result of a shift in product mix towards lower priced products our operating results would be harmed Competition in the markets for our products is increasing and we expect aggressive competition from existing competitors and other companies that may introduce new technologies in the future Currently our products compete directly against products manufactured and distributed by various companies both within and outside the US Although the number of competitors varies by segment geography and customer we encounter a wide variety of competitors including wellestablished regional competitors in certain foreign markets as well as larger companies or divisions of larger companies with substantial sales marketing research and financial capabilities Due in part to the expiration of certain key patents owned by us beginning in 2017 we are facing increased competition in the clear aligner market as a result of the entry of new large companies into certain markets who have the ability to leverage their existing channels in the dental market to compete directly with us In addition corresponding foreign patents started to expire in 2018 and will likely result in increased competition in some of the markets outside the US Large consumer product companies may also enter the orthodontic supply market Furthermore we also face competition from companies that now offer clear aligners directly to the consumer and do not require the consumer to see a doctor before or during orthodontic treatment Unlike these direct to consumer competitors we are committed to a doctor in the core of everything we do and Invisalign Treatment requires a doctors prescription and an in person physical examination of the patients dentition before treatment can begin In addition we may also face competition in the future from new companies that may introduce new technologies We may be unable to compete with these competitors and one or more of these competitors may render our technology obsolete or economically unattractive If we are unable to compete effectively with existing products or respond effectively to any products developed by new or existing competitors our business could be harmed Increased competition has resulted in the past and may in the future result in volume discounting and price reductions reduced gross margins reduced profitability and loss of market share and reduce dental professionals efforts and commitment to expand their use of our products any of which could have a material adverse effect on our net revenues volume growth net income and stock price We cannot assure that we will be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors or that competitive pressures will not have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition We are dependent on our international operations which exposes us to foreign operational political and other risks that may harm our business Our key production steps are performed in operations located outside of the US Technicians use a sophisticated internally developed computermodeling program to prepare digital treatment plans which are then transmitted electronically to our aligner fabrication facilities These digital files form the basis of the ClinCheck treatment plan and are used to manufacture aligner molds and aligners Our digital treatment planning and aligner fabrication are performed in multiple international locations We will continue to establish treatment planning and aligner fabrication facilities closer to our international customers in order to improve our operational efficiency In addition to the research and development efforts conducted in our North America facilities we also carry out research and development in Moscow Russia We also have operations in Israel where we design and assemble wands 15 and our intraoral scanner is manufactured Our reliance on international operations exposes us to risks and uncertainties that may affect our business or results of operation including  difficulties in hiring and retaining employees generally as well as difficulties in hiring and retaining employees with the necessary skills to perform the more technical aspects of our operations  difficulties in managing international operations including any travel restrictions to or from our facilities  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  import and export controls license requirements and restrictions  controlling production volume and quality of the manufacturing process  political social and economic instability including increased levels of violence in Juarez Mexico or the Middle East We cannot predict the effect on us of any future armed conflict political instability or violence in these regions In addition some of our employees in Israel are obligated to perform annual reserve duty in the Israeli military and are subject to being called for additional active duty under emergency circumstances We cannot predict the full impact of these conditions on us in the future particularly if emergency circumstances or an escalation in the political situation occurs If many of our employees are called for active duty our operations in Israel and our business may not be able to function at full capacity  acts of terrorism and acts of war  general geopolitical instability and the responses to it such as the possibility of additional sanctions against China and Russia which continue to bring uncertainty to these regions  interruptions and limitations in telecommunication services  product or material transportation delays or disruption including as a result of customs clearance increased levels of violence acts of terrorism acts of war or health epidemics restricting travel to and from our international locations or as a result of natural disasters such as earthquakes or volcanic eruptions  burdens of complying with a wide variety of local country and regional laws including the risks associated with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local antibribery compliance  trade restrictions and changes in tariffs including the recent tariffs imposed by the US and China and the possibility of additional tariffs or other trade restrictions related to trade between the two countries and  potential adverse tax consequences If any of these risks materialize in the future we could experience production delays and lost or delayed revenue We earn an increasingly larger portion of our total revenues from international sales and face risks attendant to those operations We earn an increasingly larger portion of our total revenues from international sales generated through our foreign direct and indirect operations Since our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to further penetrate markets outside the US and increase the localization of our products and services we expect to continue to increase our sales and presence outside the US particularly in the highgrowth markets Our international operations are subject to risks that are customarily encountered in nonUS operations including  local political and economic instability  the engagement of activities by our employees contractors partners and agents especially in countries with developing economies that are prohibited by international and local trade and labor laws and other laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act the United Kingdom UK Bribery Act of 2010 and export control laws in spite of our policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws  fluctuations in currency exchange rates and  increased expense of developing testing and making localized versions of our products 16 Any of these factors either individually or in combination could materially impact our international operations and adversely affect our business as a whole We face risks related to our international sales including the need to obtain necessary foreign regulatory clearance or approvals We currently sell our products outside of North America As a result we are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country The time required to obtain clearances or approvals required by other countries may be longer than that required for US Food and Drug Administration FDA clearance or approval and requirements for such approvals may differ from FDA requirements We may be unable to obtain regulatory approvals in one or more of the other countries in which we do business or in which we may do business in the future We may also incur significant costs in attempting to obtain and maintain foreign regulatory approvals If we experience delays in receipt of approvals to market our products outside of the US or if we fail to receive these approvals we may be unable to market our products or enhancements in international markets in a timely manner if at all which could materially impact our international operations and adversely affect our business as a whole Demand for our products may not increase as rapidly as we anticipate due to a variety of factors including a weakness in general economic conditions Consumer spending habits are affected by among other things prevailing economic conditions levels of employment salaries and wage rates gas prices consumer confidence and consumer perception of economic conditions A general slowdown in the US economy and certain international economies or an uncertain economic outlook would adversely affect consumer spending habits which may among other things result in a decrease in the number of overall orthodontic case starts reduced patient traffic in dentists offices reduction in consumer spending on elective or higher value procedures or a reduction in the demand for dental services generally each of which would have a material adverse effect on our sales and operating results Weakness in the global economy results in a challenging environment for selling dental technologies and dentists may postpone investments in capital equipment such as intraoral scanners In addition Invisalign treatment which currently accounts for the vast majority of our net revenues represents a significant change from traditional orthodontic treatment and customers and consumers may be reluctant to accept it or may not find it preferable to traditional treatment We have generally received positive feedback from orthodontists GPs and consumers regarding Invisalign treatment as both an alternative to braces and as a clinical method for the treatment of malocclusion but a number of dental professionals believe that the Invisalign treatment is appropriate for only a limited percentage of their patients Increased market acceptance of all of our products will depend in part upon the recommendations of dental professionals as well as other factors including effectiveness safety ease of use reliability aesthetics and price compared to competing products Our future success may depend on our ability to develop successfully introduce and achieve market acceptance of new products or product offerings Our future success may depend on our ability to develop manufacture market and obtain regulatory approval or clearance of new products or product offerings There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop sell and achieve market acceptance of these and other new products and applications and enhanced versions of our existing product or software The extent of and rate at which market acceptance and penetration are achieved by new or future products or offerings is a function of many variables which include among other things our ability to  correctly identify customer needs and preferences and predict future needs and preferences  include functionality and features that address customer requirements  ensure compatibility of our computer operating systems and hardware configurations with those of our customers  allocate our research and development funding to products with higher growth prospects  anticipate and respond to our competitors development of new products product offerings and technological innovations  differentiate our products and product offerings from our competitors  innovate and develop new technologies and applications  the availability of thirdparty reimbursement of procedures using our products  obtain adequate intellectual property rights and  encourage customers to adopt new technologies 17 If we fail to accurately predict customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenue Even if we successfully innovate and develop new products and product enhancements we may incur substantial costs in doing so and our profitability may suffer In addition even if our new products are successfully introduced it is unlikely that they will rapidly gain market share and acceptance primarily due to the relatively long period of time it takes to successfully treat a patient with Invisalign Since it typically takes approximately 12 to 24 months to treat a patient our customers may be unwilling to rapidly adopt our new products until they successfully complete at least one case or until more historical clinical results are available Our ability to market and sell new products may also be subject to government regulation including approval or clearance by the FDA and foreign government agencies Any failure in our ability to successfully develop and introduce or achieve market acceptance of our new products or enhanced versions of existing products could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and could cause our net revenues to decline The frequency of use of the Invisalign System by orthodontists or GPs may not increase at the rate that we anticipate or at all One of our key objectives is to continue to increase utilization or the adoption and frequency of use of the Invisalign System by new and existing customers If utilization of the Invisalign System by our existing and newly trained orthodontists or GPs does not occur or does not occur as quickly as we anticipate our operating results could be harmed We may experience declines in average selling prices of our products which may decrease our net revenues We provide volumebased discount programs to our doctors In addition we sell a number of products at different list prices If we change the volumebased discount programs affecting our average selling prices if we introduce any price reductions or consumer rebate programs if we expand our discount programs in the future or participation in these programs increases or if our product mix shifts to lower priced products or to products that have a higher percentage of deferred revenue our average selling prices would be adversely affected and our net revenues gross profit gross margin and net income may be reduced We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations Although the US dollar is our reporting currency a portion of our net revenues and net income are generated in foreign currencies Net revenues and net income generated by subsidiaries operating outside of the US are translated into US dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period and are affected by changes in exchange rates As a result negative movements in currency exchange rates against the US dollar will adversely affect our net revenues and net income in our consolidated financial statements The exchange rate between the US dollar and foreign currencies has fluctuated substantially in recent years and may continue to fluctuate substantially in the future As a result we enter into currency forward contract transactions in an effort to cover some of our exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations These transactions may not operate to fully or effectively hedge our exposure to currency fluctuations and under certain circumstances these transactions could have an adverse effect on our financial condition As we continue to grow we are subject to growth related risks including risks related to excess or constrained capacity and operational efficiencies at our manufacturing and treat facilities We are subject to growth related risks including excess or constrained capacity and pressure on our internal systems and personnel In order to manage current operations and future growth effectively we will need to continue to implement and improve our operational financial and management information systems and to hire train motivate manage and retain employees We may be unable to manage such growth effectively Any such failure could have a material adverse impact on our business operations and prospects We are establishing additional order acquisition treatment planning and manufacturing facilities closer to our international customers in order to improve our operational efficiency and provide doctors with a better experience to further improve their confidence in using Invisalign to treat more patients more often Our ability to plan construct and equip additional order acquisition treatment planning and manufacturing facilities is subject to significant risk and uncertainty including risks inherent in the establishment of a facility such as hiring and retaining employees and delays and cost overruns as a result of a number of factors any of which may be out of our control and may negatively impact our gross margin In addition these new facilities are located in higher cost regions compared to Mexico and Costa Rica which may negatively impact our gross margin If the transition into these additional facilities is significantly delayed or demand for our product exceeds our current expectations we may not be able to fulfill orders timely which may negatively impact our financial results and overall business In addition because we cannot immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to changing market conditions our facility capacity may at times exceed or fall short of our production requirements In addition if product demand decreases or we fail to forecast demand 18 accurately we could be required to write off inventory or record excess capacity charges which would lower our gross margin Production of our intraoral scanners may also be limited by capacity constraints due to a variety of factors including our dependency on third party vendors for key components in addition to limited production yields Any or all of these problems could result in the loss of customers provide an opportunity for competing products to gain market acceptance and otherwise harm our business and financial results  We are subject to risks associated with leasing retail space subject to longterm and noncancelable leases We may be unable to renew leases at the end of their terms If we close a leased retail space we remain obligated under the applicable lease We have recently increased the number of retail locations leased by us as we continue to expand our Invisalign Experience program We do not own any of our retail locations We currently lease the majority of our Invisalign locations under longterm noncancelable leases which usually have initial terms ranging from three to ten years We believe that the majority of the leases we enter into in the future will likely be longterm and noncancelable Generally our leases are net leases which require us to pay our proportionate share of the cost of insurance taxes maintenance and utilities If we determine that it is no longer economical to operate a retail location subject to a lease and decide to or are otherwise required to close it for any reason including as a result of an adverse ruling in the SDC dispute see Item 3 Legal Proceedings  SDC Dispute we may remain obligated under the applicable lease for among other things payment of the base rent for the balance of the lease term In addition as each of our leases expire we may be unable to negotiate renewals either on commercially acceptable terms or at all which could cause us to close retail spaces in desirable locations Our inability to secure desirable retail space or favorable lease terms could impact our ability to grow our Invisalign Experience program as desired Likewise our obligation to continue making lease payments in respect of leases for closed retail spaces could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations If we fail to sustain or increase profitability or revenue growth in future periods the market price for our common stock may decline If we are to sustain or increase profitability in future periods we will need to continue to increase our net revenues while controlling our expenses Because our business is evolving it is difficult to predict our future operating results or levels of growth and we have not in the past and may not in the future be able to sustain our historical growth rates If we do not increase profitability Invisalign volume and revenue growth or otherwise meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors the market price of our common stock will likely decline Our financial results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future which may cause volatility in our stock price Our operating results have fluctuated in the past and we expect our future quarterly and annual operating results to fluctuate as we focus on increasing doctor and consumer demand for our products These fluctuations could cause our stock price to decline or significantly fluctuate Some of the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include  limited visibility into and difficulty predicting from quarter to quarter the level of activity in our customers practices including limited visibility into the number of aligners purchased by SmileDirectClub LLC SDC under the supply agreement  weakness in consumer spending as a result of a slowdown in the global US or other economies  changes in product mix  higher manufacturing costs driven by an increase in the numbers of aligners per case  changes in relationships with our dental support organizations including timing of orders  changes in the timing of receipt of Invisalign case product orders during a given quarter which given our cycle time and the delay between case receipts and case shipments could have an impact on which quarter revenues can be recognized  fluctuations in currency exchange rates against the US dollar  our inability to scale production of our iTero Element scanner to meet customer demand  if participation in our customer rebate or discount programs increases our average selling price will be adversely affected  seasonal fluctuations in the number of doctors in their offices and their availability to take appointments  success of or changes to our marketing programs from quarter to quarter 19  our reliance on our contract manufacturers for the production of subassemblies for our intraoral scanners  timing of industry tradeshows  changes in the timing of when revenues are recognized including as a result of the introduction of new products product offerings or promotions modifications to our terms and conditions or as a result of changes to critical accounting estimates or new accounting pronouncements  changes to our effective tax rate  unanticipated delays in production caused by insufficient capacity or availability of raw materials  any disruptions in the manufacturing process including unexpected turnover in the labor force or the introduction of new production processes power outages or natural or other disasters beyond our control  underutilization of manufacturing and treat facilities  the development and marketing of directly competitive products by existing and new competitors  changes in relationships with our distributors  impairments in the value of our investments in SDC and other privately held companies could be material  major changes in available technology or the preferences of customers may cause our current product offerings to become less competitive or obsolete  aggressive price competition from competitors  costs and expenditures in connection with litigation  costs and expenditures in connection with establishment of treatment planning and Aligner fabrication in international locations  costs and expenditures in connection with hiring and deployment of direct sales force personnel  the timing of new product introductions by us and our competitors as well as customer order deferrals in anticipation of enhancements or new products  unanticipated delays in our receipt of patient records made through an intraoral scanner for any reason  disruptions to our business due to political economic or other social instability including the impact of an epidemic any of which results in changes in consumer spending habits consumers unable or unwilling to visit the orthodontist or general practitioners office as well as any impact on workforce absenteeism  inaccurate forecasting of net revenues production and other operating costs  investments in research and development to develop new products and enhancements  disruptions to our business as a result of our agreement to manufacture clear aligners for SDC including market acceptance of the SDC business model and product possible adverse customer reaction and negative publicity about us and our products  changes in accounting standards policies and estimates including changes made by our equity investee and  our ability to successfully hedge against a portion of our foreign currencydenominated assets and liabilities To respond to these and other factors we may need to make business decisions that could adversely affect our operating results such as modifications to our pricing policy business structure or operations Most of our expenses such as employee compensation and lease payment obligations are relatively fixed in the short term Moreover our expense levels are based in part on our expectations regarding future revenue levels As a result if our net revenues for a particular period fall below our expectations whether caused by changes in consumer spending consumer preferences weakness in the US or global economies changes in customer behavior related to advertising and prescribing our product or other factors we may be unable to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any shortfall in net revenues Due to these and other factors we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our 20 operating results may not be meaningful You should not rely on our results for any one quarter as an indication of our future performance A disruption in the operations of our primary freight carrier or higher shipping costs could cause a decline in our net revenues or a reduction in our earnings We are dependent on commercial freight carriers primarily UPS to deliver our products to our customers If the operations of these carriers are disrupted for any reason we may be unable to deliver our products to our customers on a timely basis If we cannot deliver our products in an efficient and timely manner our customers may reduce their orders from us and our net revenues and gross margin could materially decline In a rising fuel cost environment our freight costs will increase In addition we earn an increasingly larger portion of our total revenues from international sales International sales carry higher shipping costs which could negatively impact our gross margin and results of operations If freight costs materially increase and we are unable to pass that increase along to our customers for any reason or otherwise offset such increases in our cost of net revenues our gross margin and financial results could be adversely affected If we are unable to accurately predict our volume growth and fail to hire a sufficient number of technicians in advance of such demand the delivery time of our products could be delayed which could adversely affect our results of operations Treatment planning is a key step leading to our manufacturing process which relies on sophisticated computer technology requiring new technicians to undergo a relatively long training process Training production technicians takes approximately 90 to 120 days As a result if we are unable to accurately predict our volume growth we may not have a sufficient number of trained technicians to deliver our products within the time frame our customers expect Such a delay could cause us to lose existing customers or fail to attract new customers This could cause a decline in our net revenues and net income and could adversely affect our results of operations Our headquarters digital dental modeling processes and other manufacturing processes are principally located in regions that are subject to earthquakes and other natural disasters Our digital dental modeling is primarily processed in our facility located in San Jose Costa Rica The operations team in Costa Rica creates ClinCheck treatment plans using sophisticated computer software In addition our customer facing operations are located in Costa Rica Our aligner molds and finished aligners are fabricated in Juarez Mexico Both locations in Costa Rica and Mexico are in earthquake zones and may be subject to other natural disasters If there is a major earthquake or any other natural disaster in a region where one of these facilities is located our ability to create ClinCheck treatment plans respond to customer inquiries or manufacture and ship our aligners could be compromised which could result in our customers experiencing a significant delay in receiving their completed aligners and a decrease in service levels for a period of time In addition our corporate headquarters in California is located in the San Francisco Bay Area An earthquake or other natural disaster in this region could result in a disruption in our operations Any such business interruption could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations Our information technology systems are critical to our business System integration and implementation issues and system security risks could disrupt our operations which could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results We rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems All information technology systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources As our business has grown in size and complexity the growth has placed and will continue to place significant demands on our information technology systems To effectively manage this growth our information systems and applications require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology evolving industry and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences We are continuing to transform certain business processes extend established processes to new subsidiaries andor implement additional functionality in our enterprise resource planning ERP software system which entails certain risks including difficulties with changes in business processes that could disrupt our operations such as our ability to track orders and timely ship products manage our supply chain and aggregate financial and operational data System upgrades and enhancements require significant expenditures and allocation of valuable employee resources Delays in integration or disruptions to our business from implementation of these new or upgraded systems could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results Additionally we continuously upgrade our customer facing software applications specifically the ClinCheck and MyAligntech software Software applications frequently contain errors or defects especially when they are first introduced or when new versions are released The discovery of a defect or error or the incompatibility with the computer operating system and hardware configurations 21 of customers in a new upgraded version or the failure of our primary information systems may result in the following consequences among others loss of revenues or delay in market acceptance damage to our reputation or increased service costs any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations If the information we rely upon to run our businesses were to be found to be inaccurate or unreliable if we fail to properly maintain our information systems and data integrity or if we fail to develop new capabilities to meet our business needs in a timely manner we could have operational disruptions have customer disputes lose our ability to produce timely and accurate reports have regulatory or other legal problems have increases in operating and administrative expenses lose existing customers have difficulty in attracting new customers or in implementing our growth strategies or suffer other adverse consequences In addition experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security or our cloudbased software servers hosted by third party and misappropriate our confidential information or that of third parties create system disruptions or cause shutdowns Furthermore sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we either internally develop or procure from third parties which we depend upon may contain defects in design and manufacture including bugs and other problems that can unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system The costs to eliminate or alleviate security problems viruses and bugs could be significant and the efforts to address these problems could result in interruptions that may have a material adverse impact on our operations net revenues and operating results Furthermore our business requires the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks Because of the confidential health information we store and transmit security breaches could expose us to a risk of regulatory action litigation possible liability and loss We have experienced breaches in the past and our security measures may be inadequate to prevent security breaches and our business operations and profitability would be adversely affected by among other things loss of customers and potential criminal and civil sanctions if they are not prevented There can be no assurance that our process of improving existing systems developing new systems to support our expanding operations integrating new systems protecting confidential patient information and improving service levels will not be delayed or that additional systems issues will not arise in the future Failure to adequately protect and maintain the integrity of our information systems and data may result in a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows If the security of our customer and patient information is compromised patient care could suffer and we could be liable for related damages and our reputation could be impaired We retain confidential customer and patient information in our processing centers Therefore it is critical that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure and are also perceived by the marketplace and our customers to be secure Despite the implementation of security measures we have experienced breaches in the past and our infrastructure may be vulnerable to physical breakins computer viruses programming errors or other technical malfunctions hacking or phishing attacks by third parties employee error or malfeasance or similar disruptive problems If we fail to meet our customer and patients expectations regarding the security of healthcare information we could be liable for damages and our reputation and competitive position could be impaired Affected parties could initiate legal or regulatory action against us which could cause us to incur significant expense and liability or result in orders forcing us to modify our business practices Concerns over our privacy practices could adversely affect others perception of us and deter customers advertisers and partners from using our products In addition patient care could suffer and we could be liable if our systems fail to deliver correct information in a timely manner We have cybersecurity insurance related to a breach event covering expenses for notification credit monitoring investigation crisis management public relations and legal advice The policy also provides coverage for regulatory action defense including fines and penalties potential payment card industry fines and penalties and costs related to cyber extortion however damage and claims arising from such incidents may not be covered or may exceed the amount of any insurance available We are also subject to several federal state and foreign laws and regulations including ones relating to privacy data protection content regulation and consumer protection These laws and regulations are constantly evolving and may be interpreted applied created or amended in a manner that could adversely affect our business In addition we must comply with numerous data protection requirements that span from individual state and national laws in the US to multinational requirements in the EU In the EU Align must comply with the General Data Protection Regulation GDPR which became effective on May 25 2018 and serves as a harmonization of European dataprivacy laws We believe we have designed our product and service offerings to be compliant with the requirements of applicable data protection laws and regulations Maintaining systems that are compliant with these laws and regulations is costly and could require complex changes in the way we do business or provide services to our customers and their patients Additionally our success may be dependent on the success of healthcare providers in managing data protection requirements 22 Our success depends in part on our proprietary technology and if we are unable to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights our competitive position may be harmed Litigating claims of this type is costly and could distract our management and cause a decline in our results of operations and stock price Our success will depend in part on our ability to maintain existing intellectual property and to obtain and maintain further intellectual property protection for our products both in the US and in other countries Our inability to do so could harm our competitive position As of December 31 2018  we had 449 active US patents 423 active foreign patents and 486 pending global patent applications We intend to rely on our portfolio of issued and pending patent applications in the US and in other countries to protect a large part of our intellectual property and our competitive position however our currently pending or future patent filings may not result in the issuance of patents Additionally any patents issued to us may be challenged invalidated held unenforceable circumvented or may not be sufficiently broad to prevent third parties from producing competing products similar in design to our products In addition any protection afforded by foreign patents may be more limited than that provided under US patents and intellectual property laws Certain of our key patents began to expire in 2017 which may result in increased competition or less expensive alternatives to our products We also rely on protection of our copyrights trade secrets knowhow and proprietary information We generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants and our collaborative partners upon commencement of a relationship with us however these agreements may not provide meaningful protection against the unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or other confidential information and adequate remedies may not exist if unauthorized use or disclosure were to occur Our inability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology through patents copyrights or trade secrets would impair our competitive advantages and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and future growth prospects In particular a failure to protect our proprietary rights might allow competitors to copy our technology which could adversely affect our pricing and market share In addition in an effort to protect our intellectual property we have in the past been and may in the future be involved in litigation The potential effects on our business operations resulting from litigation that we may participate in the future whether or not ultimately determined in our favor or settled by us are costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from normal business operations Litigation interferences oppositions reexams inter partes reviews post grant reviews or other proceedings are have been and may in the future be necessary in some instances to determine the validity and scope of certain of our proprietary rights and in other instances to determine the validity scope or noninfringement of certain patent rights claimed by third parties to be pertinent to the manufacture use or sale of our products Litigation interference oppositions reexams inter partes reviews post grant reviews administrative challenges or other similar types of proceedings are unpredictable and may be protracted expensive and distracting to management The outcome of such proceedings could adversely affect the validity and scope of our patent or other proprietary rights hinder our ability to manufacture and market our products require us to seek a license for the infringed product or technology or result in the assessment of significant monetary damages An unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or in cases where injunctive relief is sought an injunction prohibiting us from selling our products Any of these results from our litigation could adversely affect our results of operations and stock price While we believe we currently have adequate internal control over financial reporting we are required to assess our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis and any future adverse results from such assessment could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price Pursuant to the SarbanesOxley Act of 2002 and the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC we are required to furnish in our Form 10K a report by our management regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting The report includes among other things an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective This assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management While we believe our internal control over financial reporting is currently effective the effectiveness of our internal controls in future periods is subject to the risk that our controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions including our transition of further business operations into our ERP software system and as a result the degree of compliance of our internal control over financial reporting with the existing policies or procedures may become ineffective Establishing testing and maintaining an effective system of internal control over financial reporting requires significant resources and time commitments on the part of our management and our finance staff may require additional staffing and infrastructure investments and would increase our costs of doing business If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective in any future period or if our auditors are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls or conclude that our internal controls are ineffective we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which could have an adverse effect on our stock price 23 If we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain key personnel we may be unable to pursue business opportunities or develop our products We are highly dependent on the key employees in our clinical engineering technology development sales training and marketing personnel and management teams The loss of the services provided by those individuals may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our product development and other business objectives and could harm our business Our future success will also depend on our ability to identify recruit train and retain additional qualified personnel including orthodontists and production technicians in our treat facilities Few orthodontists are accustomed to working in a manufacturing environment since they are generally trained to work in private practices universities and other research institutions Thus we may be unable to attract and retain personnel with the advanced qualifications necessary for the further development of our business Furthermore we may not be successful in retaining our key personnel or their services If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our business could be materially harmed If we infringe the patents or proprietary rights of other parties or are subject to a patent infringement claim our ability to grow our business may be severely limited Extensive litigation over patents and other intellectual property rights is common in the medical device industry We have been sued for infringement of third partys patents in the past and we may be the subject of patent or other litigation in the future From time to time we have received and may in the future receive letters from third parties drawing our attention to their patent rights While we do not believe that we infringe upon any valid and enforceable rights that have been brought to our attention there may be other more pertinent rights of which we are presently unaware The defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings could result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion of effort by our technical and management personnel An adverse determination of any litigation or interference proceeding to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liabilities An adverse determination of this nature could also put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly or require us to seek licenses from third parties Licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all in which event our business would be materially adversely affected We maintain single supply relationships for certain of our key machines and materials technologies and our business and operating results could be harmed if supply is restricted or ends or the price of raw materials used in our manufacturing process increases We are highly dependent on manufacturers of specialized scanning equipment rapid prototyping machines resin and other advanced materials as well as the optics electronic and other mechanical components of our intraoral scanners We maintain single supply relationships for many of these machines and materials technologies In particular our CT scanning and stereolithography equipment used in our aligner manufacturing and many of the critical components for the optics of our scanners are provided by single suppliers We are also committed to purchasing the vast majority of our resin and polymer the primary raw materials used in our manufacturing process for clear aligners from a single source If these or other suppliers encounter financial operating or other difficulties or if our relationship with them changes we might not be able to quickly establish or qualify replacement sources of supply and could face production interruptions delays and inefficiencies In addition technology changes by our vendors could disrupt access to required manufacturing capacity or require expensive time consuming development efforts to adapt and integrate new equipment or processes Our growth may exceed the capacity of one or more of these manufacturers to produce the needed equipment and materials in sufficient quantities to support our growth Conversely in order to secure supplies for production of products we sometimes enter into noncancelable minimum purchase commitments with vendors which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to reflect declining market demands If demand for our products is less than we expect we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges and our profitability may suffer In the event of technology changes delivery delays or shortages of or increases in price for these items our business and growth prospects may be harmed We depend on a single contract manufacturer and supplier of parts used in our iTero scanner and any disruption in this relationship may cause us to fail to meet the demands of our customers and damage our customer relationships We rely on a third party manufacturer to supply key subassemblies for our iTero Element scanner As a result if this third party manufacturer fails to deliver its components if we lose its services or if we fail to negotiate acceptable terms we may be unable to deliver our products in a timely manner and our business may be harmed Any difficulties encountered by the third party manufacturer with respect to hiring personnel and maintaining acceptable manufacturing standards controls procedures and policies could disrupt our ability to deliver our products in a timely manner Finding a substitute manufacturer may be expensive timeconsuming or impossible and could result in a significant interruption in the supply of our intraoral scanning products Any failure by our contract manufacturer that results in delays in our fulfillment of customer orders may cause us to lose revenues and suffer damage to our customer relationships 24 We primarily rely on our direct sales force to sell our products and any failure to maintain our direct sales force could harm our business Our ability to sell our products and generate revenues primarily depends upon our direct sales force within our Americas and International markets We do not have any longterm employment contracts with the members of our direct sales force The loss of the services provided by these key personnel may harm our business We recently hired approximately 100 sales personnel in the Americas and plan on hiring 50 in the EMEA region in the first quarter of 2019 To adequately train and successfully deploy new representatives into these regions and to establish strong customer relationships takes approximately six to twelve months As a result if we are unable to retain our direct sales force personnel or replace them with individuals of equivalent technical expertise and qualifications or if we are unable to successfully instill such technical expertise in recently hired sales representatives or if we fail to establish and maintain strong relationships with our customers within a relatively short period of time our net revenues and our ability to maintain market share could be materially harmed In addition due to our large and fragmented customer base we may not be able to provide all of our customers with product support immediately upon the launch of a new product As a result adoption of new products by our customers may be slower than anticipated and our ability to grow market share and increase our net revenues may be harmed Complying with regulations enforced by the FDA and other regulatory authorities is an expensive and timeconsuming process and any failure to comply could result in substantial penalties Our products are considered medical devices and are subject to extensive regulation in the US and internationally FDA regulations are wide ranging and govern among other things  product design development manufacturing and testing  product labeling  product storage  premarket clearance or approval  complaint handling and corrective actions  advertising and promotion and  product sales and distribution Our failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in enforcement action by the FDA or state agencies which may include any of the following sanctions  warning letters fines injunctions consent decrees and civil penalties  repair replacement refunds recall or seizure of our products  operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production  refusing our requests for 510k clearance or premarket approval of new products new intended uses or modifications to existing products  withdrawing clearance or premarket approvals that have already been granted and  criminal prosecution If any of these events were to occur they could harm our business We must comply with facility registration and product listing requirements of the FDA and adhere to applicable Quality System regulations The FDA enforces its Quality System regulations through periodic unannounced inspections Our failure to take satisfactory corrective action in response to an adverse inspection or the failure to comply with applicable manufacturing regulations could result in enforcement action and we may be required to find alternative manufacturers which could be a long and costly process Any FDA enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us Before we can sell a new medical device in the US or market a new use of or claim for an existing product we must obtain FDA clearance or approval unless an exemption applies Obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals can be a lengthy and timeconsuming process Even though the devices we market have obtained the necessary clearances from the FDA we may be unable 25 to maintain such clearances in the future Furthermore we may be unable to obtain the necessary clearances for new devices that we intend to market in the future Our inability to maintain or obtain regulatory clearances or approvals could materially harm our business In addition as part of the DoddFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act the SEC adopted disclosure requirements regarding the use of certain minerals known as conflict minerals which are mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries as well as procedures regarding a manufacturers efforts to identify and discourage the sourcing of such minerals and metals produced from those minerals Additional reporting obligations are being proposed by the European Union The US requirements and any additional requirements in Europe could affect the sourcing and availability of metals used in the manufacture of a limited number of parts if any contained in our products For example these disclosure requirements may decrease the number of suppliers capable of supplying our needs for certain metals thereby negatively affecting our ability to obtain products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices Our material sourcing is broad based and multitiered and we may be unable to conclusively verify the origins for all metals used in our products We may suffer financial and reputational harm if customers require and we are unable to deliver certification that our products are conflict free Regardless we will incur additional costs associated with compliance with these disclosure requirements including timeconsuming and costly efforts to determine the source of any conflict minerals used in our products If compliance with healthcare regulations becomes costly and difficult for our customers or for us we may not be able to grow our business Participants in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive and frequently changing regulations under numerous laws administered by governmental entities at the federal state and local levels some of which are and others of which may be applicable to our business Furthermore our healthcare provider customers are also subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations that could affect the nature and scope of their relationships with us The healthcare market itself is highly regulated and subject to changing political economic and regulatory influences Regulations implemented pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act HIPAA including regulations affecting the security and privacy of patient healthcare information held by healthcare providers and their business associates may require us to make significant and unplanned enhancements of software applications or services result in delays or cancellations of orders or result in the revocation of endorsement of our products and services by healthcare participants The effect of HIPAA and newly enforced regulations on our business is difficult to predict and there can be no assurance that we will adequately address the business risks created by HIPAA and its implementation or that we will be able to take advantage of any resulting business opportunities Extensive and changing government regulation of the healthcare industry may be expensive to comply with and exposes us to the risk of substantial government penalties In addition to medical device laws and regulations numerous state and federal healthcarerelated laws regulate our business covering areas such as  storage transmission and disclosure of medical information and healthcare records  prohibitions against the offer payment or receipt of remuneration to induce referrals to entities providing healthcare services or goods or to induce the order purchase or recommendation of our products and  the marketing and advertising of our products Complying with these laws and regulations could be expensive and timeconsuming and could increase our operating costs or reduce or eliminate certain of our sales and marketing activities or our revenues Our business exposes us to potential product liability claims and we may incur substantial expenses if we are subject to product liability claims or litigation Medical devices involve an inherent risk of product liability claims and associated adverse publicity We may be held liable if any product we develop or any product that uses or incorporates any of our technologies causes injury or is otherwise found unsuitable Although we intend to continue to maintain product liability insurance adequate insurance may not be available on acceptable terms if at all and may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities A product liability claim regardless of its merit or eventual outcome could result in significant legal defense costs These costs would have the effect of increasing our expenses and diverting managements attention away from the operation of our business and could harm our business 26 Historically the market price for our common stock has been volatile The market price of our common stock could be subject to wide price fluctuations in response to various factors many of which are beyond our control The factors include  quarterly variations in our results of operations and liquidity  changes in recommendations by the investment community or in their estimates of our net revenues or operating results  speculation in the press or investment community concerning our business and results of operations  strategic actions by our competitors such as product announcements or acquisitions  announcements of technological innovations or new products or product offerings by us our customers or competitors  key decisions in pending litigation and  general economic market conditions In addition the stock market in general and the market for technology and medical device companies in particular have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated to or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies These broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance Historically class action litigation is often brought against an issuing company following periods of volatility in the market price of a companys securities Future sales of significant amounts of our common stock may depress our stock price A large percentage of our outstanding common stock is currently owned by a small number of significant stockholders These stockholders have sold in the past and may sell in the future large amounts of common stock over relatively short periods of time Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market by our existing stockholders may adversely affect the market price of our common stock Such sales could create public perception of difficulties or problems with our business and may depress our stock price We are subject to risks associated with our strategic investments Impairments in the value of our investments and receivables could negatively impact our financial results We have invested in SDC and other privately held companies for strategic reasons and to support key business initiatives and we may not realize a return on our strategic investments Many of such companies generate net losses and the market for their products services or technologies may be slow to develop Further valuations of privately held companies are inherently complex due to the lack of readily available market data If we determine that our investments and receivables in SDC or investments in other privately held companies have experienced a decline in value we may be required to record impairments which could be material and could have an adverse impact on our financial results In addition SDC is seeking through the arbitration described below under Item 3 Legal Proceedings  SDC Dispute the right to repurchase all of the Companys SDC membership interests for a purchase price equal to the current capital account balance as defined by the Internal Revenue Service which likely is significantly below the current fair market value of such investment Changes in or interpretations of accounting rules and regulations could result in unfavorable accounting charges We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the US GAAP These principles are subject to interpretation by the SEC and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies A change in these policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even retroactively affect previously reported transactions Our accounting policies that recently have been or may be affected by changes in the accounting rules relate to revenue recognition and leases If we fail to manage our exposure to global financial and securities market risk successfully our operating results and financial statements could be materially impacted The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal To achieve this objective a majority of our marketable investments are investment grade liquid fixedincome securities and money market instruments denominated in US dollars If the carrying value of our investments exceeds the fair value and the decline in fair value is deemed to be otherthantemporary we will be required to write down the value of our investments which could materially harm our results of operations and financial condition Moreover the performance of certain securities in our investment portfolio correlates with the credit condition of the 27 US financial sector In an unstable credit environment we might incur significant realized unrealized or impairment losses associated with these investments If our goodwill or longlived assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings Under GAAP we review our goodwill and longlived asset group for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable Additionally goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually The qualitative and quantitative analysis used to test goodwill are dependent upon various assumptions and reflect managements best estimates Changes in certain assumptions including revenue growth rates discount rates earnings multiples and future cash flows may cause a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of goodwill or the asset group may be impaired We may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in the financial statements during the period in which any impairment of goodwill or asset group are determined Our effective tax rate may vary significantly from period to period Various internal and external factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our future effective tax rate These factors include but are not limited to changes in tax laws such as the TCJA enacted into law on December 22 2017 regulations andor rates new or changes to accounting pronouncements nondeductible goodwill impairments changing interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations changes in the relative proportions of revenues and income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates the future levels of tax benefits of stockbased compensation settlement of income tax audits and changes in overall levels of pretax earnings As a result of the adoption of Accounting Standards Update ASU 201609 in 2017 we anticipate our effective tax rate to vary significantly in our first quarter due to the timing of when the majority of our equity compensation vests each year Other quarters can also be impacted depending on the timing of equity vests Changes in tax laws or tax rulings could negatively impact our income tax provision and net income As a US multinational corporation we are subject to changing tax laws both within and outside of the US Changes in tax laws or tax rulings or changes in interpretations of existing tax laws could affect our income tax provision and net income or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business In addition governmental tax authorities are increasingly scrutinizing the tax positions of companies Many countries in Europe as well as a number of other countries and organizations have recently proposed or recommended changes to existing tax laws or have enacted new laws For example the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD has been working on a Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project which is focused on a number of issues including the shifting of profits between affiliated entities in different tax jurisdictions In 2015 the OECD issued and is expected to continue to issue guidelines and proposals that may change various aspects of the existing framework under which our tax obligations are determined in many of the countries in which we do business ITEM 1B UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None ITEM 2 PROPERTIES We occupy several leased and owned

a class action lawsuit against Align and three of our executive officers was filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of California on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of our common stock between July 25 2018 and October 24 2018 The complaint generally alleges claims under the federal securities laws and seeks monetary damages in an unspecified amount and costs and expenses incurred in the litigation On December 12 2018 a similar lawsuit was filed in the same court on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of our common stock between April 25 2018 and October 24 2018 together with the first lawsuit the Securities Actions Motions for appointment as lead plaintiff were filed on January 4 2019 Align believes the plaintiffs claims are without merit and intends to vigorously defend itself Align is currently unable to predict the outcome of these lawsuits and therefore cannot determine the likelihood of loss nor estimate a range of possible loss Shareholder Derivative Lawsuit In January 2019 three derivative lawsuits were also filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of California purportedly on behalf of Align naming as defendants the members of our Board of Directors along with certain of our executive officers The allegations in the complaints are similar to those presented in the Securities Action but the complaints assert various state law causes of action including for breaches of fiduciary duty insider trading and unjust enrichment among others The complaints seek unspecified monetary damages on behalf of Align which is named solely as a nominal defendant against whom no recovery is sought as well as disgorgement and the costs and expenses associated with the litigation including attorneys fees Align is currently unable to predict the outcome of these lawsuits and therefore cannot determine the likelihood of loss nor estimate a range of possible loss Patent Infringement and Related Lawsuits On November 14 2017 Align filed six patent infringement lawsuits asserting 26 patents against 3Shape a Danish corporation and a related US corporate entity asserting that 3Shapes Trios intraoral scanning system and Dental System software infringe Align patents Align filed two Section 337 complaints with the US International Trade Commission ITC alleging that 3Shape violates US trade laws by selling for importation and importing its infringing Trios intraoral scanning system and Dental System software Aligns ITC complaints seek cease and desist orders and exclusion orders prohibiting the importation of 3Shapes Trios scanning system and Dental System software products into the US Align also filed four separate complaints in the US District Court for the District of Delaware alleging patent infringement by 3Shapes Trios intraoral scanning system and Dental System software On May 9 2018 3Shape filed a complaint in the US District Court for the District of Delaware alleging patent infringement by Aligns iTero Element scanner of a single 3Shape patent On June 14 2018 3Shape filed another complaint in the US District Court for the District of Delaware alleging patent infringement by Aligns iTero Element scanner of a single 3Shape patent On August 28 2018 3Shape filed a complaint against Align in the US District Court for the District of Delaware alleging antitrust violations and seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief relating to Aligns market activities including Aligns assertion of its patent portfolio in the clear aligner and intraoral scanning markets On December 10 2018 Align filed three additional patent infringement lawsuits asserting 10 additional patents against 3Shape Align filed one Section 337 complaint with the ITC alleging that 3Shape violates US trade laws through unfair competition by selling for importation and importing the infringing TRIOS intraoral scanning system Trios Lab Scanners and TRIOS software TRIOS Module software Dental System software and Ortho System Software On December 11 2018 Align filed two separate complaints in the US District Court for the District of Delaware alleging patent infringement by 3Shapes Trios intraoral scanning system Lab Scanners and Dental and Ortho System Software Except for 3Shapes antitrust complaint each of the District Court complaints seek monetary damages and injunctive relief against further infringement We are currently unable to predict the outcome of this dispute and therefore cannot determine the likelihood of loss if any nor estimate a range of possible loss SDC Dispute In February 2018 we received a communication on behalf of SDC Financial LLC SmileDirectClub LLC and the Members of SDC Financial LLC other than the Company collectively the SDC Entities alleging that the launch and operation of the 29 Invisalign locations pilot program constitutes a breach of noncompete provisions applicable to the members of SDC Financial LLC including Align As a result of this alleged breach SDC Financial LLC notified us that its members other than Align seek to exercise a right to repurchase all of Aligns SDC Financial LLC membership interests for a purchase price equal to the current capital account balance The SDC Entities communication also alleged that we breached confidentiality provisions applicable to the SDC Financial LLC members and demanded that we cease all activities related to the Invisalign pilot project close existing Invisalign locations and cease using SDCs confidential information In April 2018 the SDC Entities served a Demand for Arbitration alleging that we breached the noncompete clause and confidentiality clause misused the SDC Entities alleged trade secrets and violated fiduciary duties to SDC Financial LLC The SDC Entities seek through the arbitration the rights to repurchase all of Aligns SDC Financial LLC membership interests for a purchase price equal to the current capital account balance as defined by the Internal Revenue Service which likely is significantly below the current fair market value of such investment an injunction requiring us to close our Invisalign locations and to cease using the SDC Entities confidential information and financial damages in an unspecified amount We filed a response in which we denied the SDC Entities allegations and denied that the SDC Entities are entitled to any relief In April 2018 the SDC Entities also filed a motion for preliminary injunction in the Tennessee Court of Chancery seeking to enjoin Align from opening additional Invisalign locations until the arbitration is completed In June 2018 the Tennessee court denied the SDC Entities motion for a preliminary injunction In December 2018 the parties participated in binding arbitration proceedings and presented closing arguments on January 23 2019 The arbitrators decision is due on or before March 4 2019 This dispute does not impact Aligns existing supply agreement with SDC which remains in place through 2019 We do not intend to renew this agreement We are currently unable to predict the outcome of this dispute and therefore cannot determine the likelihood of loss if any nor estimate a range of possible loss In addition in the course of Aligns operations Align is involved in a variety of claims suits investigations and proceedings including actions with respect to intellectual property claims patent infringement claims government investigations labor and employment claims breach of contract claims tax and other matters Regardless of the outcome these proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of defense costs diversion of management resources and other factors Although the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict and Aligns view of these matters may change in the future as litigation and events related thereto unfold Align currently does not believe that these matters individually or in the aggregate will materially affect Aligns financial position results of operations or cash flows  Refer to Note 8 Legal Proceedings of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statement s for details on legal proceedings ITEM 4 MINE SAFETY
