digital services Boeing Capital Segment BCC seeks to ensure that Boeing customers have the financing they need to buy and take delivery of their Boeing product and manages overall financing exposure BCC s portfolio consists of equipment under operating leases finance leases notes and other receivables assets held for sale or release and investments Intellectual Property We own numerous patents and have licenses for the use of patents owned by others which relate to our products and their manufacture In addition to owning a large portfolio of intellectual property we also license intellectual property to and from third parties For example the US government has licenses in our patents that are developed in performance of government contracts and it may use or authorize others to use the inventions covered by such patents for government purposes Unpatented research development and engineering skills as well as certain trademarks trade secrets and other intellectual property rights also make an important contribution to our business While our intellectual property rights in the aggregate are important to the operation of each of our businesses we do not believe that our business would be materially affected by the expiration of any particular intellectual property right or termination of any particular intellectual property patent license agreement Employees Total workforce level at December 31 2018 was approximately 153000  As of December 31 2018  our principal collective bargaining agreements were with the following unions Union Percent of our Employees Represented Status of the Agreements with Major Union The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers IAM 22 We have two major agreements one expiring in June 2022 and one in September 2024 The Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace SPEEA 11 We have two major agreements expiring in Octo ber 2022 The United Automobile Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America UAW 1 We have one major agreement expiring in October 2022 Competition The commercial jet aircraft market and the airline industry remain extremely competitive We face aggressive international competitors who are intent on increasing their market share such as Airbus and other entrants from Russia China and Japan We are focused on improving our processes and continuing cost reduction efforts We intend to continue to compete with other airplane manufacturers by providing customers with greater value products BDS faces strong competition in all market segments primarily from Lockheed Martin Corporation Northrop Grumman Corporation Raytheon Company General Dynamics Corporation and SpaceX NonUS companies such as BAE Systems and Airbus Group continue to build a strategic presence in the US 2 Table of Contents market by strengthening their North American operations and partnering with US defense companies In addition certain competitors have occasionally formed teams with other competitors to address specific customer requirements BDS expects the trend of strong competition to continue into 2019  The commercial and defense services market is an extremely challenging landscape made up of many of the same strong US and nonUS competitors facing BCA and BDS along with other competitors in those markets BGS leverages our extensive services network offering products and services which span the life cycle of our defense and commercial airplane programs training fleet services and logistics maintenance and engineering modifications and upgrades  as well as the daily cycle of gatetogate operations BGS expects the market to remain highly competitive in 2019  and intends to grow market share by leveraging a high level of customer satisfaction and productivity Regulatory Matters Our businesses are heavily regulated in most of our markets We deal with numerous US government agencies and entities including but not limited to all of the branches of the US military NASA the Federal Aviation Administration FAA and the Department of Homeland Security Similar government authorities exist in our nonUS markets Government Contracts The US government and other governments may terminate any of our government contracts at their convenience as well as for default based on our failure to meet specified performance requirements If any of our US government contracts were to be terminated for convenience we generally would be entitled to receive payment for work completed and allowable termination or cancellation costs If any of our government contracts were to be terminated for default generally the US government would pay only for the work that has been accepted and could require us to pay the difference between the original contract price and the cost to reprocure the contract items net of the work accepted from the original contract The US government can also hold us liable for damages resulting from the default Commercial Aircraft In the US our commercial aircraft products are required to comply with FAA regulations governing production and quality systems airworthiness and installation approvals repair procedures and continuing operational safety Outside the US similar requirements exist for airworthiness installation and operational approvals These requirements are generally administered by the national aviation authorities of each country and in the case of Europe coordinated by the European Joint Aviation Authorities Environmental We are subject to various federal state local and nonUS laws and regulations relating to environmental protection including the discharge treatment storage disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and wastes We continually assess our compliance status and management of environmental matters to ensure our operations are in compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations Investigation remediation and operation and maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance and management of sites are a normal recurring part of our operations These costs often are allowable costs under our contracts with the US government It is reasonably possible that costs incurred to ensure continued environmental compliance could have a material impact on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows if additional work requirements or more stringent cleanup standards are imposed by regulators new areas of soil air and groundwater contamination are discovered andor expansions of work scope are prompted by the results of investigations A Potentially Responsible Party PRP has joint and several liability under existing US environmental laws Where we have been designated a PRP by the Environmental Protection Agency or a state environmental agency we are potentially liable to the government or third parties for the full cost of remediating contamination at our facilities or former facilities or at thirdparty sites If we were required to fully fund the remediation of a site for which we were originally assigned a partial share the statutory 3 Table of Contents framework would allow us to pursue rights to contribution from other PRPs For additional information relating to environmental contingencies see Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements NonUS Sales Our nonUS sales are subject to both US and nonUS governmental regulations and procurement policies and practices including regulations relating to importexport control tariffs investment exchange controls anticorruption and repatriation of earnings NonUS sales are also subject to varying currency political and economic risks Raw Materials Parts and Subassemblies We are highly dependent on the availability of essential materials parts and subassemblies from our suppliers and subcontractors The most important raw materials required for our aerospace products are aluminum sheet plate forgings and extrusions titanium sheet plate forgings and extrusions and composites including carbon and boron Although alternative sources generally exist for these raw materials qualification of the sources could take a year or more Many major components and product equipment items are procured or subcontracted on a solesource basis with a number of companies Suppliers We are dependent upon the ability of a large number of US and nonUS suppliers and subcontractors to meet performance specifications quality standards and delivery schedules at our anticipated costs While we maintain an extensive qualification and performance surveillance system to control risk associated with such reliance on third parties failure of suppliers or subcontractors to meet commitments could adversely affect production schedules and programcontract profitability thereby jeopardizing our ability to fulfill commitments to our customers We are also dependent on the availability of energy sources such as electricity at affordable prices Seasonality No material portion of our business is considered to be seasonal Executive Officers of the Registrant See Item 10 Directors Executive Officers and Corporate Governance in Part III

Contents ForwardLooking Statements This report as well as our annual report to shareholders quarterly reports and other filings we make with the SEC press and earnings releases and other written and oral communications contain forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 Words such as may should expects intends projects plans believes estimates targets anticipates and similar expressions generally identify these forwardlooking statements Examples of forwardlooking statements include statements relating to our future financial condition and operating results as well as any other statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact Forwardlooking statements are based on expectations and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable when made but that may not prove to be accurate These statements are not guarantees and are subject to risks uncertainties and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict Many factors including those set forth in the Risk Factors section below and other important factors disclosed in this report and from time to time in our other filings with the SEC could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from these forwardlooking statements Any forwardlooking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made and we assume no obligation to update or revise any forwardlooking statement whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise except as required by law Item 1A Risk Factors An investment in our common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties and our actual results and future trends may differ materially from our past or projected future performance We urge investors to consider carefully the risk factors described below in evaluating the information contained in this report Our Commercial Airplanes and Global Services businesses depend heavily on commercial airlines and are subject to unique risks Market conditions have a significant impact on demand for our commercial aircraft and related services The commercial aircraft market is predominantly driven by longterm trends in airline passenger and cargo traffic The principal factors underlying longterm traffic growth are sustained economic growth and political stability both in developed and emerging markets Demand for our commercial aircraft is further influenced by airline profitability availability of aircraft financing world trade policies governmenttogovernment relations technological advances price and other competitive factors fuel prices terrorism epidemics and environmental regulations Traditionally the airline industry has been cyclical and very competitive and has experienced significant profit swings and constant challenges to be more cost competitive In addition availability of financing to nonUS customers depends in part on the ExportImport Bank of the United States being fully operational Significant deterioration in the global economic environment the airline industry generally or the financial stability of one or more of our major customers could result in fewer new orders for aircraft or services or could cause customers to seek to postpone or cancel contractual orders andor payments to us which could result in lower revenues profitability and cash flows and a reduction in our contractual backlog In addition because our commercial aircraft backlog consists of aircraft scheduled for delivery over a period of several years any of these macroeconomic industry or customer impacts could unexpectedly affect deliveries over a long period We enter into firm fixedprice aircraft sales contracts with indexed price escalation clauses which could subject us to losses if we have cost overruns or if increases in our costs exceed the applicable escalation rate Commercial aircraft sales contracts are often entered into years before the aircraft are delivered In order to help account for economic fluctuations between the contract date and delivery date aircraft pricing generally consists of a fixed amount as modified by price escalation formulas derived from labor commodity and other price indices Our revenue estimates are based on current expectations with respect to these escalation formulas but the actual escalation amounts are outside of our control Escalation factors can 5 Table of Contents fluctuate significantly from period to period Changes in escalation amounts can significantly impact revenues and operating margins in our Commercial Airplanes business We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of commercial airlines We can make no assurance that any customer will exercise purchase options fulfill existing purchase commitments or purchase additional products or services from us In addition fleet decisions airline consolidations or financial challenges involving any of our major commercial airline customers could significantly reduce our revenues and limit our opportunity to generate profits from those customers Our Commercial Airplanes business depends on our ability to maintain a healthy production system achieve planned production rate targets successfully develop new aircraft or new derivative aircraft and meet or exceed stringent performance and reliability standards The commercial aircraft business is extremely complex involving extensive coordination and integration with US and nonUS suppliers highlyskilled labor from thousands of employees and other partners and stringent regulatory requirements and performance and reliability standards In addition the introduction of new aircraft programs andor derivatives such as the 777X involves increased risks associated with meeting development testing production and certification schedules As a result our ability to deliver aircraft on time satisfy regulatory and customer requirements and achieve or maintain as applicable program profitability is subject to significant risks We must minimize disruption caused by production changes and achieve productivity improvements in order to meet customer demand and maintain our profitability We have plans to adjust production rates on several of our commercial aircraft programs while at the same time engaging in significant ongoing development and production of the 777X aircraft In addition we continue to seek opportunities to reduce the costs of building our aircraft including working with our suppliers to reduce supplier costs identifying and implementing productivity improvements and optimizing how we manage inventory If production rate changes at any of our commercial aircraft assembly facilities are delayed or create significant disruption to our production system or if our suppliers cannot timely deliver components to us at the cost and rates necessary to achieve our targets we may be unable to meet delivery schedules andor the financial performance of one or more of our programs may suffer Operational challenges impacting the production system for one or more of our commercial aircraft programs could result in production delays andor failure to meet customer demand for new aircraft either of which would negatively impact our revenues and operating margins Our commercial aircraft production system is extremely complex Operational issues including delays or defects in supplier components failure to meet internal performance plans or delays or failures to achieve required regulatory certifications could result in significant outofsequence work and increased production costs as well as delayed deliveries to customers impacts to aircraft performance andor increased warranty or fleet support costs If our commercial airplanes fail to satisfy performance and reliability requirements we could face additional costs andor lower revenues Developing and manufacturing commercial aircraft that meet or exceed our performance and reliability standards as well as those of customers and regulatory agencies can be costly and technologically challenging These challenges are particularly significant with newer aircraft programs Any failure of any Boeing aircraft to satisfy performance or reliability requirements could result in disruption to our operations higher costs andor lower revenues Changes in levels of US government defense spending or overall acquisition priorities could negatively impact our financial position and results of operations We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from the US government primarily from defense related programs with the United States Department of Defense  US DoD  Levels of US defense spending are very difficult to predict and may be impacted by numerous factors such as the political environment US 6 Table of Contents foreign policy macroeconomic conditions and the ability of the US government to enact relevant legislation such as authorization and appropriations bills The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 raised preexisting spending caps for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 FY18 and FY19 The consolidated spending bills signed into law in September 2018 provide defense funding for FY19 However other departments and agencies including the National Aeronautics and Space Administration NASA and the Federal Aviation Administration FAA are being temporarily funded at FY18 levels Failure to enact a Continuing Resolution or FY19 appropriations by February 15 2019 would result in a partial government shutdown affecting these departments and agencies Such a shutdown could impact the Companys operations In addition reduced discretionary spending limits initially enacted in 2011 would take effect again in fiscal years 2020 and 2021 FY20 and FY21 unless Congress acts to raise the spending caps or to repeal or suspend the law establishing the reduced limits As a result continued budget uncertainty and the risk of future sequestration cuts remain and it is likely that US government discretionary spending levels will continue to be subject to pressure In addition there continues to be significant uncertainty with respect to future programlevel appropriations for the US DoD and other government agencies including NASA within the overall budgetary framework described above While the House and Senate Appropriations Committees included funding for Boeings major programs such as FA18 Super Hornet CH47 Chinook AH64 Apache V22 Osprey KC46A Pegasus Tanker and P8 Poseidon in their final FY19 defense appropriations uncertainty remains about how defense budgets in FY20 and beyond will affect Boeings programs Future budget cuts or investment priority changes including changes associated with the authorizations and appropriations process could result in reductions cancellations andor delays of existing contracts or programs Any of these impacts could have a material effect on the results of the Companys operations financial position andor cash flows In addition as a result of the significant ongoing uncertainty with respect to both US defense spending levels and the nature of the threat environment we expect the US DoD to continue to emphasize costcutting and other efficiency initiatives in its procurement processes If we can no longer adjust successfully to these changing acquisition priorities andor fail to meet affordability targets set by the US DoD customer our revenues and market share would be further impacted We conduct a significant portion of our business pursuant to US government contracts which are subject to unique risks In 2018  31 of our revenues were earned pursuant to US government contracts which include foreign military sales FMS through the US government Business conducted pursuant to such contracts is subject to extensive procurement regulations and other unique risks Our sales to the US government are subject to extensive procurement regulations and changes to those regulations could increase our costs New procurement regulations or changes to existing requirements could increase our compliance costs or otherwise have a material impact on the operating margins of our BDS and BGS businesses These requirements may result in increased compliance costs and we could be subject to additional costs in the form of withheld payments andor reduced future business if we fail to comply with these requirements in the future Compliance costs attributable to current and potential future procurement regulations such as these could negatively impact our financial condition and operating results The US government may modify curtail or terminate one or more of our contracts The US government contracting party may modify curtail or terminate its contracts and subcontracts with us without prior notice and either at its convenience or for default based on performance In addition funding pursuant to our US government contracts may be reduced or withheld as part of the US Congressional appropriations process due to fiscal constraints changes in US national security strategy andor priorities or other 7 Table of Contents reasons Further uncertainty with respect to ongoing programs could also result in the event that the US government finances its operations through temporary funding measures such as continuing resolutions rather than fullyear appropriations Any loss or anticipated loss or reduction of expected funding andor modification curtailment or termination of one or more large programs could have a material adverse effect on our earnings cash flow andor financial position We are subject to US government inquiries and investigations including periodic audits of costs that we determine are reimbursable under US government contracts US government agencies including the Defense Contract Audit Agency and the Defense Contract Management Agency routinely audit government contractors These agencies review our performance under contracts cost structure and compliance with applicable laws regulations and standards as well as the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies Any costs found to be misclassified or inaccurately allocated to a specific contract will be deemed nonreimbursable and to the extent already reimbursed must be refunded Any inadequacies in our systems and policies could result in withholds on billed receivables penalties and reduced future business Furthermore if any audit inquiry or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions including termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments fines and suspension or debarment from doing business with the US government We also could suffer reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us even if such allegations are later determined to be false We enter into fixedprice contracts which could subject us to losses if we have cost overruns Our BDS and BGS defense businesses generated approximately 65 and 77 of their 2018 revenues from fixedprice contracts While fixedprice contracts enable us to benefit from performance improvements cost reductions and efficiencies they also subject us to the risk of reduced margins or incurring losses if we are unable to achieve estimated costs and revenues If our estimated costs exceed our estimated price we recognize reachforward losses which can significantly affect our reported results For example during 2018 we recorded reachforward losses totaling 736 million on the USAF KC46A Tanker contract primarily reflecting higher estimated costs associated with certification testing and change incorporation on aircraft as well as higher than expected effort to meet customer requirements in order to support delivery of the initial aircraft In addition in 2018 in connection with winning the TX and MQ25 Stingray competitions we recorded a loss of 400 million associated with options for 346 TX Trainer aircraft and a loss of 291 million related to the MQ25 Stingray Engineering Manufacturing and Development EMD contract The long term nature of many of our contracts makes the process of estimating costs and revenues on fixedprice contracts inherently risky Fixedprice contracts often contain price incentives and penalties tied to performance which can be difficult to estimate and have significant impacts on margins In addition some of our contracts have specific provisions relating to cost schedule and performance Fixedprice development contracts are generally subject to more uncertainty than fixedprice production contracts Many of these development programs have highly complex designs In addition technical or quality issues that arise during development could lead to schedule delays and higher costs to complete which could result in a material charge or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition Examples of significant BDS fixedprice development contracts include Commercial Crew Saudi F15 USAF KC46A Tanker  TX Trainer VC25B Presidential Aircraft MQ25 Stingray and commercial and military satellites We enter into costtype contracts which also carry risks Our BDS and BGS defense businesses generated approximately 35 and 23 of their 2018 revenues from costtype contracting arrangements Some of these are development programs that have complex design and technical challenges These costtype programs typically have award or incentive fees that are subject to uncertainty and may be earned over extended periods In these cases the associated financial risks are primarily in reduced fees lower profit rates or program cancellation if cost schedule or technical 8 Table of Contents performance issues arise Programs whose contracts are primarily costtype include GMD  Proprietary and SLS programs We enter into contracts that include inorbit incentive payments that subject us to risks Contracts in the commercial satellite industry and certain government satellite contracts include inorbit incentive payments These inorbit payments may be paid over time after final satellite acceptance or paid in full prior to final satellite acceptance In both cases the inorbit incentive payment is at risk if the satellite does not perform to specifications for up to 15 years after acceptance The net present value of inorbit incentive fees we ultimately expect to realize is recognized as revenue in the construction period If the satellite fails to meet contractual performance criteria customers will not be obligated to continue making inorbit payments andor we may be required to provide refunds to the customer and incur significant charges Our ability to deliver products and services that satisfy customer requirements is heavily dependent on the performance and financial stability of our subcontractors and suppliers as well as on the availability of raw materials and other components We rely on other companies including US and nonUS subcontractors and suppliers to provide and produce raw materials integrated components and subassemblies and production commodities and to perform some of the services that we provide to our customers If one or more of our suppliers or subcontractors experiences financial difficulties delivery delays or other performance problems we may be unable to meet commitments to our customers or incur additional costs For example the 737 program experienced supply chain disruptions in 2018 that impacted the timing of certain deliveries during the year In addition if one or more of the raw materials on which we depend such as aluminum titanium or composites becomes unavailable or is available only at very high prices we may be unable to deliver one or more of our products in a timely fashion or at budgeted costs In some instances we depend upon a single source of supply Any service disruption from one of these suppliers either due to circumstances beyond the suppliers control such as geopolitical developments or as a result of performance problems or financial difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet commitments to our customers or increase our operating costs We use estimates in accounting for many contracts and programs Changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financial results Contract and program accounting require judgment relative to assessing risks estimating revenues and costs and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues Due to the size and nature of many of our contracts and programs the estimation of total revenues and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables Assumptions have to be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract or program because costs also include expected increases in wages and employee benefits material prices and allocated fixed costs Incentives or penalties related to performance on contracts are considered in estimating sales and profit rates and are recorded when there is sufficient information for us to assess anticipated performance Suppliers assertions are also assessed and considered in estimating costs and profit rates Estimates of award fees are also used in sales and profit rates based on actual and anticipated awards With respect to each of our commercial aircraft programs inventoriable production costs including overhead program tooling and other nonrecurring costs and routine warranty costs are accumulated and charged as cost of sales by program instead of by individual units or contracts A program consists of the estimated number of units accounting quantity of a product to be produced in a continuing longterm production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates To establish the relationship of sales to cost of sales program 9 Table of Contents accounting requires estimates of a the number of units to be produced and sold in a program b the period over which the units can reasonably be expected to be produced and c the units expected sales prices production costs program tooling and other nonrecurring costs and routine warranty costs for the total program Several factors determine accounting quantity including firm orders letters of intent from prospective customers and market studies Changes to customer or model mix production costs and rates learning curve changes to price escalation indices costs of derivative aircraft supplier performance customer and supplier negotiationssettlements supplier claims andor certification issues can impact these estimates Any such change in estimates relating to program accounting may adversely affect future financial performance Because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes described above materially different sales and profit amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change Changes in underlying assumptions circumstances or estimates may adversely affect future period financial performance

AccountingProgram Accounting on pages 43  44 and Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 54  66 of this Form 10K Competition within our markets and with respect to the products we sell may reduce our future contracts and sales The markets in which we operate are highly competitive and one or more of our competitors may have more extensive or more specialized engineering manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we do in some areas In our Commercial Airplanes business we anticipate increasing competition among nonUS aircraft manufacturers of commercial jet aircraft In our BDS business we anticipate that the effects of defense industry consolidation fewer large and new programs and new priorities including near and longterm cost competitiveness of our US DoD and nonUS customers will intensify competition for many of our BDS products Our BGS segment faces competition from many of the same strong US and nonUS competitors facing BCA and BDS Furthermore we are facing increased international competition and crossborder consolidation of competition There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors or that the competitive pressures we face will not result in reduced revenues and market share We derive a significant portion of our revenues from nonUS sales and are subject to the risks of doing business in other countries In 2018  nonUS customers which includes FMS accounted for approximately 56 of our revenues We expect that nonUS sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future As a result we are subject to risks of doing business internationally including  changes in regulatory requirements  US and nonUS government policies including requirements to expend a portion of program funds locally and governmental industrial cooperation or participation requirements  fluctuations in international currency exchange rates  volatility in international political and economic environments and changes in nonUS national priorities and budgets which can lead to delays or fluctuations in orders  the complexity and necessity of using nonUS representatives and consultants  the uncertainty of the ability of nonUS customers to finance purchases including the availability of financing from the ExportImport Bank of the United States  uncertainties and restrictions concerning the availability of funding credit or guarantees 10 Table of Contents  imposition of domestic and international taxes export controls tariffs embargoes sanctions and other trade restrictions  the difficulty of management and operation of an enterprise spread over many countries  compliance with a variety of nonUS laws as well as US laws affecting the activities of US companies abroad and  unforeseen developments and conditions including terrorism war epidemics and international tensions and conflicts While the impact of these factors is difficult to predict any one or more of these factors could adversely affect our operations in the future Unauthorized access to our or our customers information and systems could negatively impact our business We face certain security threats including threats to the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data and systems We maintain an extensive network of technical security controls policy enforcement mechanisms monitoring systems and management oversight in order to address these threats While these measures are designed to prevent detect and respond to unauthorized activity in our systems certain types of attacks including cyberattacks could result in significant financial or information losses andor reputational harm In addition we manage information and information technology systems for certain customers Many of these customers face similar security threats If we cannot prevent the unauthorized access release andor corruption of our customers confidential classified or personally identifiable information our reputation could be damaged andor we could face financial losses The outcome of litigation and of government inquiries and investigations involving our business is unpredictable and an adverse decision in any such matter could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations We are involved in a number of litigation matters These matters may divert financial and management resources that would otherwise be used to benefit our operations No assurances can be given that the results of these matters will be favorable to us An adverse resolution of any of these lawsuits or future lawsuits could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations In addition we are subject to extensive regulation under the laws of the United States and its various states as well as other jurisdictions in which we operate As a result we are sometimes subject to government inquiries and investigations of our business due among other things to our business relationships with the US government the heavily regulated nature of our industry and in the case of environmental proceedings our current or past ownership of certain property Any such inquiry or investigation could potentially result in an adverse ruling against us which could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations A significant portion of our customer financing portfolio is concentrated among certain customers and in certain types of Boeing aircraft which exposes us to concentration risks A significant portion of our customer financing portfolio is concentrated among certain customers and in distinct geographic regions Our portfolio is also concentrated by varying degrees across Boeing aircraft product types most notably 717 and 7478 aircraft and among customers that we believe have less than investmentgrade credit If one or more customers holding a significant portion of our portfolio assets experiences financial difficulties or otherwise defaults on or does not renew its leases with us at their expiration and we are unable to redeploy the aircraft on reasonable terms or if the types of aircraft that are concentrated in our portfolio suffer greater than expected declines in value our earnings cash flows andor financial position could be materially adversely affected 11 Table of Contents We may be unable to obtain debt to fund our operations and contractual commitments at competitive rates on commercially reasonable terms or in sufficient amounts We depend in part upon the issuance of debt to fund our operations and contractual commitments As of December 31 2018 and 2017  our airplane financing commitments totaled 19462 million and 10221 million  If we require additional funding in order to fund outstanding financing commitments or meet other business requirements our market liquidity may not be sufficient A number of factors could cause us to incur increased borrowing costs and to have greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for debt These factors include disruptions or declines in the global capital markets andor a decline in our financial performance outlook or credit ratings The occurrence of any or all of these events may adversely affect our ability to fund our operations and contractual or financing commitments We may not realize the anticipated benefits of mergers acquisitions joint venturesstrategic alliances or divestitures As part of our business strategy we may merge with or acquire businesses andor form joint ventures and strategic alliances For example in 2018 we completed the acquisition of KLX Inc a provider of aviation parts and services Whether we realize the anticipated benefits from these acquisitions and related activities depends in part upon our ability to integrate the operations of the acquired business the performance of the underlying product and service portfolio and the performance of the management team and other personnel of the acquired operations Accordingly our financial results could be adversely affected by unanticipated performance issues legacy liabilities transactionrelated charges amortization of expenses related to intangibles charges for impairment of longterm assets credit guarantees partner performance and indemnifications Consolidations of joint ventures could also impact our reported results of operations or financial position While we believe that we have established appropriate and adequate procedures and processes to mitigate these risks there is no assurance that these transactions will be successful We also may make strategic divestitures from time to time These transactions may result in continued financial involvement in the divested businesses such as through guarantees or other financial arrangements following the transaction Nonperformance by those divested businesses could affect our future financial results through additional payment obligations higher costs or asset writedowns Our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all significant risk exposures We are exposed to liabilities that are unique to the products and services we provide We maintain insurance for certain risks and in some circumstances we may receive indemnification from the US government The amount of our insurance coverage may not cover all claims or liabilities and we may be forced to bear substantial costs For example liabilities arising from the use of certain of our products such as aircraft technologies missile systems border security systems antiterrorism technologies andor air traffic management systems may not be insurable on commercially reasonable terms While some of these products are shielded from liability within the US under the SAFETY Act provisions of the 2002 Homeland Security Act no such protection is available outside the US potentially resulting in significant liabilities The amount of insurance coverage we maintain may be inadequate to cover these or other claims or liabilities Business disruptions could seriously affect our future sales and financial condition or increase our costs and expenses Our business may be impacted by disruptions including threats to physical security information technology or cyberattacks or failures damaging weather or other acts of nature and pandemics or other public health crises Any of these disruptions could affect our internal operations or our ability to deliver products and services to our customers Any significant production delays or any destruction manipulation or improper 12 Table of Contents use of our data information systems or networks could impact our sales increase our expenses andor have an adverse effect on the reputation of Boeing and of our products and services Some of our and our suppliers workforces are represented by labor unions which may lead to work stoppages Approximately 54000 employees which constitute 35 of our total workforce were union represented as of December 31 2018  We experienced a work stoppage in 2008 when a labor strike halted commercial aircraft and certain BDS program production We may experience additional work stoppages in the future which could adversely affect our business We cannot predict how stable our relationships currently with 11 US labor organizations and 13 nonUS labor organizations will be or whether we will be able to meet the unions requirements without impacting our financial condition The unions may also limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce Union actions at suppliers can also affect us Work stoppages and instability in our union relationships could delay the production andor development of our products which could strain relationships with customers and cause a loss of revenues which would adversely affect our operations Substantial pension and other postretirement benefit obligations have a material impact on our earnings shareholders equity and cash flows from operations and could have significant adverse impacts in future periods The majority of our employees have earned benefits under defined benefit pension plans Potential pension contributions include both mandatory amounts required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and discretionary contributions to improve the plans  funded status The extent of future contributions depends heavily on market factors such as the discount rate and the actual return on plan assets We estimate future contributions to these plans using assumptions with respect to these and other items Changes to those assumptions could have a significant effect on future contributions as well as on our annual pension costs andor result in a significant change to shareholders  equity For US government contracts we allocate pension costs to individual contracts based on US Cost Accounting Standards which can also affect contract profitability We also provide other postretirement benefits to certain of our employees consisting principally of health care coverage for eligible retirees and qualifying dependents Our estimates of future costs associated with these benefits are also subject to assumptions including estimates of the level of medical cost increases For a discussion regarding how our financial statements can be affected by pension and other postretirement plan accounting policies see  Management  s Discussion and Analysis  Critical Accounting Policies  Pension Plans  on page 45 of this Form 10K Although Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America GAAP expense and pension or other postretirement benefit contributions are not directly related the key economic factors that affect GAAP expense would also likely affect the amount of cash or stock we would contribute to our plans 13 Table of Contents Our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities We are subject to various US federal state local and nonUS laws and regulations related to environmental protection including the discharge treatment storage disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and wastes We could incur substantial costs including cleanup costs fines and civil or criminal sanctions as well as thirdparty claims for property damage or personal injury if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws or regulations In some cases we may be subject to such costs due to environmental impacts attributable to our current or past manufacturing operations or the operations of companies we have acquired In other cases we may become subject to such costs due to an indemnification agreement between us and a third party relating to such environmental liabilities In addition new laws and regulations more stringent enforcement of existing laws and regulations the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new remediation requirements could result in additional costs For additional information relating to environmental contingencies see Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements Item
