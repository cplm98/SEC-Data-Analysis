Reporting of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report for further financial information about business segments Our business is diversified across endmarkets regions customers vehicle platforms and products Our customer base includes all 25 of the largest automotive OEMs in the world and in 2017  28 of our net sales came from the Asia Pacific region which we have identified as a key market likely to experience substantial longterm growth Our ten largest platforms in 2017 were with eight different OEMs In addition in 2017 our products were found in all of the 20 topselling vehicle models in the United States in 19 of the 20 topselling vehicle models in Europe and in 13 of the 20 topselling vehicle models in China We have also entered into collaborative arrangements with mobility providers and with smart cities such as Boston and Singapore as we develop solutions for the evolving nature of the mobility industry We have established a worldwide design and manufacturing footprint with a regional service model that enables us to efficiently and effectively serve our global customers from best cost countries This regional model is structured primarily to service the North American market from Mexico the South American market from Brazil the European market from Eastern Europe and North Africa and the Asia Pacific market from China Our global scale and regional service model enables us to engineer globally and execute regionally to serve the largest OEMs which are seeking suppliers that can serve them on a worldwide basis Our footprint also enables us to adapt to the regional design variations the global OEMs require and serve the emerging market OEMs Our Industry The automotive technology and components industry provides components systems subsystems and modules to OEMs for the manufacture of new vehicles as well as to the aftermarket for use as replacement parts for current production and older vehicles Overall we expect longterm growth of global vehicle sales and production in the OEM market In 2017 the industry experienced increased global customer sales and production schedules Compared to 2016 vehicle production in 2017 increased by 4 in Europe 3 in China and 21 in South America However after several years of increases consumer demand for vehicles in North America receded resulting in a 4 decrease in North American production in 2017 as compared to the increased volumes experienced in 2016 Demand for automotive components in the OEM market is generally a function of the number of new vehicles produced in response to consumer demand which is primarily driven by macroeconomic factors such as credit availability interest rates fuel prices consumer confidence employment and other trends Although OEM demand is tied to actual vehicle production participants in the automotive technology and components industry also have the opportunity to grow through increasing product content per vehicle by further penetrating business with existing customers and in existing markets gaining new customers and increasing their presence in global markets We believe that evolving entrants into the global transportation industry such as mobility providers and smart cities will provide additional markets for our advanced technologies We believe that as a company with a global presence and advanced technology engineering manufacturing and customer support capabilities we are wellpositioned to benefit from these opportunities We believe that continuously increasing societal demands have created the three megatrends that serve as the basis for the next wave of marketdriven automotive technology advancement Our challenge is to continue developing leading edge technology focused on addressing these megatrends and apply that technology toward products with sustainable margins that enable our customers both OEMs and others to produce distinctive marketleading products We have identified a core portfolio of products that draw on our technical strengths and align with these megatrends where we believe we can provide differentiation to our customers Safe  The first megatrend Safe represents technologies aimed not just at protecting vehicle occupants when a crash occurs but those that actually proactively reduce the risk of a crash occurring OEMs continue to focus on improving occupant and pedestrian safety in order to meet increasingly stringent regulatory requirements in various markets such as a notice issued by the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration which updated its fivestar rating system to include automatic emergency braking systems as a recommended safety technology beginning with model year 2018 As a result suppliers are focused on developing technologies aimed at protecting vehicle occupants when a crash occurs as well as advanced driver assistance systems that reduce driver distractions and automated safety features that proactively mitigate the risk of a crash occurring Examples of new and alternative technologies that incorporate sophisticated detection and advanced software for collision avoidance include lane departure warning systems adaptive cruise control gesture control and automatic braking Green  The second megatrend Green represents technologies designed to help reduce emissions increase fuel economy and minimize the environmental impact of vehicles Green is a key megatrend today because of the convergence of several issues climate change volatility in oil prices an increasing number of vehicles in use worldwide and recent and pending regulation in the US and overseas regarding fuel economy and carbon dioxide emissions OEMs continue to focus on improving fuel efficiency and reducing emissions in order to meet increasingly stringent regulatory requirements in various markets On a worldwide basis the relevant authorities in 7 Table of Contents the European Union the United States China India Japan Brazil South Korea and Argentina have already instituted regulations requiring further reductions in emissions andor increased fuel economy through 2017 In many cases other authorities have initiated legislation or regulation that would further tighten the standards through 2020 and beyond Based on the current regulatory environment we believe that OEMs including those in the US and China will be subject to requirements for even greater reductions in carbon dioxide CO 2   emissions over the next ten years These standards will require meaningful innovation as OEMs and suppliers are forced to find ways to improve engine management electrical power consumption vehicle weight and integration of alternative technologies eg electrichybrid propulsion As a result suppliers are developing innovations that result in significant improvements in fuel economy emissions and performance from gasoline and diesel internal combustion engines and permit engine downsizing without loss of performance At the same time suppliers are also developing and marketing new and alternative technologies that support hybrid vehicles electric vehicles and fuel cell products to improve fuel economy and emissions We are developing key enabling technologies in the areas of charging and on vehicle power distribution and control that are essential to the introduction of our customers electrified vehicle platforms Connected  The third megatrend Connected represents technologies designed to seamlessly integrate todays highly complex vehicles into the electronic operating environment and provide drivers with connectivity to the global information network The technology content of vehicles continues to increase as consumers demand greater safety personalization infotainment productivity and convenience while driving which in turn leads to increasing demand for electrical architecture as a foundation for this content Also with increased smart device usage in vehicles driver distractions can be dramatically increased which in turn results in greater risk of accidents We are pioneering vehicletovehicle V2V and vehicletoinfrastructure V2I communication technologies which enable vehicles to detect and signal danger reducing vehicle collisions and improving driver safety while also maintaining connectivity to an increasing number of devices inside and outside of vehicles We are also developing advanced connectivity solutions such as overtheair OTA technology that will enable vehicles to receive software updates remotely and collect marketrelevant data from connected vehicles We expect these megatrends to continue to create growth and opportunity for us We believe we are wellpositioned to provide solutions and products to OEMs to expand the electronic and technological content of their vehicles We also believe electronics integration which generally refers to products and systems that combine integrated circuits software algorithms sensor technologies and mechanical components within the vehicle will allow OEMs to achieve substantial reductions in weight and mechanical complexity resulting in easier assembly enhanced fuel economy improved emissions control and better vehicle performance Convergence of Safe Green and Connected Solutions in New Mobility and Autonomous Driving The combination of advanced technologies being developed within these megatrends is also contributing to increasing industry development of autonomous driving technologies leading to a fully automated driving experience We expect automated driving technologies will provide strong societal benefit as well as the opportunity for longterm growth for our product offerings in this space including new potential customers such as mobility providers and smart cities that require solutions to increasing urban mobility challenges Societal benefits of increased vehicle automation include enhanced safety resulting from collision avoidance and improved vehicle control environmental improvements a reduction in CO 2 emissions resulting from optimized driving behavior labor cost savings and improved productivity as a result of alternate uses for drive time Growth opportunities in this space result from increased content additional computing power and software requirements enhanced connectivity systems and increased electrification and interconnects We believe the complexity of these systems will also require ongoing software support services as these vehicle systems will be continuously upgraded with new features and performance enhancements We are continuing to invest in the automated driving space and have continued to develop marketleading automated driving platform solutions such as automated driving software key active safety sensing technologies and our MultiDomain Controller which fuses information from sensing systems as well as mapping and navigation data to make driving decisions We believe we are wellaligned with industry technology trends that will result in sustainable future growth in this space and have partnered with other leaders in the field to advance the pace of development and commercialization of these technologies We have entered into a collaborative arrangement with Mobileye NV to jointly develop the Centralized Sensing Localization and Planning CSLP system a complete turnkey fully autonomous driving platform for our OEM customers with the goal of being production ready for 2019 We also entered into a collaborative arrangement with Intel Corporation and the BMW Group to develop and deploy automated driving technology Additionally in 2017 we acquired nuTonomy Inc in order to further accelerate our commercialization of automated driving solutions The acquisition of nuTonomy is the latest in a series of investments we have made to expand our position in the new mobility space including the previous acquisitions of automated driving software developer Ottomatika and data service companies ControlTec and Movimento 8 Table of Contents We believe the increasing societal demand for mobility on demand MoD services will accelerate the development of autonomous driving technologies strongly benefiting the MoD space We have entered into agreements to develop fullyautonomous vehicles and associated infrastructure as part of automated MoD pilots for the government of Singapore and the city of Boston As a result of our substantial investments and strategic partnerships in this space we believe we are wellaligned with industry technology trends that will result in sustainable future growth in these evolving areas To guide our product strategies and investments in technology with a focus on developing advanced technologies to drive growth within the Safe Green and Connected megatrends we utilize and benefit from our Technology Advisory Council a panel of prominent global technology thought leaders Standardization of Sourcing by OEMs Many OEMs are adopting global vehicle platforms to increase standardization reduce per unit cost and increase capital efficiency and profitability As a result OEMs are selecting suppliers that have the capability to manufacture products on a worldwide basis as well as the flexibility to adapt to regional variations Suppliers with global scale and strong design engineering and manufacturing capabilities are best positioned to benefit from this trend OEMs are also increasingly looking to their suppliers to simplify vehicle design and assembly processes to reduce costs As a result suppliers that sell vehicle components directly to manufacturers Tier I suppliers have assumed many of the design engineering research and development and assembly functions traditionally performed by vehicle manufacturers Suppliers that can provide fullyengineered solutions systems and preassembled combinations of component parts are positioned to leverage the trend toward system sourcing Shorter Product Development Cycles As a result of government regulations and customer preferences OEMs are requiring suppliers to respond faster with new designs and product innovations While these trends are more prevalent in mature markets the emerging markets are advancing rapidly towards the regulatory standards and consumer preferences of the more mature markets Suppliers with strong technologies robust global engineering and development capabilities will be best positioned to meet OEM demands for rapid innovation Products Our organizational structure and management reporting

these sales are included in net sales to PSA 10 Table of Contents Supply Relationships with Our Customers We typically supply products to our OEM customers through purchase orders which are generally governed by general terms and conditions established by each OEM Although the terms and conditions vary from customer to customer they typically contemplate a relationship under which our customers place orders for their requirements of specific components supplied for particular vehicles but are not required to purchase any minimum amount of products from us These relationships typically extend over the life of the related vehicle Prices are negotiated with respect to each business award which may be subject to adjustments under certain circumstances such as commodity or foreign exchange escalationdeescalation clauses or for cost reductions achieved by us The terms and conditions typically provide that we are subject to a warranty on the products supplied in most cases the duration of such warranty is coterminous with the warranty offered by the OEM to the enduser of the vehicle We may also be obligated to share in all or a part of recall costs if the OEM recalls its vehicles for defects attributable to our products Individual purchase orders are terminable for cause or nonperformance and in most cases upon our insolvency and certain change of control events In addition many of our OEM customers have the option to terminate for convenience on certain programs which permits our customers to impose pressure on pricing during the life of the vehicle program and issue purchase contracts for less than the duration of the vehicle program which potentially reduces our profit margins and increases the risk of our losing future sales under those purchase contracts Additionally our largest customer GM expressly reserves a right to terminate for competitiveness on certain of our longterm supply contracts We manufacture and ship based on customer release schedules normally provided on a weekly basis which can vary due to cyclical automobile production or dealer inventory levels Although customer programs typically extend to future periods and although there is an expectation that we will supply certain levels of OEM production during such future periods customer agreements including applicable terms and conditions do not necessarily constitute firm orders Firm orders are generally limited to specific and authorized customer purchase order releases placed with our manufacturing and distribution centers for actual production and order fulfillment Firm orders are typically fulfilled as promptly as possible from the conversion of available raw materials subcomponents and workinprocess inventory for OEM orders and from current onhand finished goods inventory for aftermarket orders The dollar amount of such purchase order releases on hand and not processed at any point in time is not believed to be significant based upon the time frame involved

million and 106 million in the United Kingdom for the years ended December 31 2017  2016 and 2015  respectively We had net property in the United Kingdom of 91 million  84 million and 88 million as of December 31 2017  2016 and 2015  respectively The largest portion of net sales in the Europe Middle East  Africa region was 1191 million  944 million and 677 million in Germany for the years ended December 31 2017  2016 and 2015  respectively 4 Net sales and net property in Asia Pacific are primarily attributable to China 11 Table of Contents Research Development and Intellectual Property We maintain technical engineering centers in major regions of the world to develop and provide advanced products processes and manufacturing support for all of our manufacturing sites and to provide our customers with local engineering capabilities and design development on a global basis As of December 31 2017  we employed approximately 16000 scientists engineers and technicians around the world Our total investment in research and development including engineering was approximately 1086 million  969 million and 895 million for the years ended December 31 2017  2016 and 2015  respectively which includes approximately 204 million  181 million and 175 million of coinvestment by customers and government agencies Each year we share some engineering expenses with OEMs and government agencies While this amount varies from yeartoyear it is generally in the range of 15 to 20 of engineering expenses We utilize a Technology Advisory Council a panel of prominent global technology thought leaders which guides our product strategies and investments in technology with a focus on developing advanced technologies to drive growth We believe that our engineering and technical expertise together with our emphasis on continuing research and development allow us to use the latest technologies materials and processes to solve problems for our customers and to bring new innovative products to market We believe that continued engineering activities are critical to maintaining our pipeline of technologically advanced products Given our strong financial discipline we seek to effectively manage fixed costs and efficiently rationalize capital spending by critically evaluating the profit potential of new and existing customer programs including investment in innovation and technology We maintain our engineering activities around our focused product portfolio and allocate our capital and resources to those products with distinctive technologies We expect expenditures for research and development activities including engineering net of coinvestment to be approximately 10 billion for the year ended December 31 2018 We maintain a large portfolio of patents in the operation of our business While no individual patent or group of patents taken alone is considered material to our business taken in the aggregate these patents provide meaningful protection for our products and technical innovations Similarly while our trademarks are important to identify our position in the industry we do not believe that any of these are individually material to our business We are actively pursuing marketing opportunities to commercialize and license our technology to both automotive and nonautomotive industries and we have selectively taken licenses from others to support our business interests These activities foster optimization of intellectual property rights Materials We procure our raw materials from a variety of suppliers around the world Generally we seek to obtain materials in the region in which our products are manufactured in order to minimize transportation and other costs The most significant raw materials we use to manufacture our products include copper and resins As of December 31 2017  we have not experienced any significant shortages of raw materials and normally do not carry inventories of such raw materials in excess of those reasonably required to meet our production and shipping schedules Commodity cost volatility most notably related to copper petroleumbased resin products and fuel is a challenge for us and our industry We are continually seeking to manage these and other materialrelated cost pressures using a combination of strategies including working with our suppliers to mitigate costs seeking alternative product designs and material specifications combining our purchase requirements with our customers andor suppliers changing suppliers hedging of certain commodities and other means In the case of copper which primarily affects our Signal and Power Solutions segment contract clauses have enabled us to pass on some of the price increases to our customers and thereby partially offset the impact of increased commodity costs on operating income for the related products However other than in the case of copper our overall success in passing commodity cost increases on to our customers has been limited We will continue our efforts to pass marketdriven commodity cost increases to our customers in an effort to mitigate all or some of the adverse earnings impacts including by seeking to renegotiate terms as contracts with our customers expire Seasonality Our business is moderately seasonal as our primary North American customers historically reduce production during the month of July and halt operations for approximately one week in December Our European customers generally reduce production during the months of July and August and for one week in December Shutdown periods in the rest of the world generally vary by country In addition automotive production is traditionally reduced in the months of July August and September due to the launch of component production for new vehicle models Accordingly our results reflect this seasonality Employees As of December 31 2017  we employed approximately 129000 people 22000 salaried employees and 107000 hourly employees In addition we maintain an alternative workforce of 18000 contract and temporary workers Our employees are represented worldwide by numerous unions and works councils including the International Union of Electronic Electrical Salaried Machine and Furniture Workers  Communications Workers of America IUECWA and the Confederacion De 12 Table of Contents Trabajadores Mexicanos In the US our employees are represented by only the IUECWA with which we have competitive wage and benefit packages Environmental Compliance We are subject to the requirements of US federal state and local and nonUS environmental and safety and health laws and regulations These include laws regulating air emissions water discharge hazardous materials and waste management We have an environmental management structure designed to facilitate and support our compliance with these requirements globally Although it is our intent to comply with all such requirements and regulations we cannot provide assurance that we are at all times in compliance Environmental requirements are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time Accordingly we cannot assure that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental costs and liabilities will not be material Certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances In addition to cleanup actions brought by US federal state local and nonUS agencies plaintiffs could raise personal injury or other private claims due to the presence of hazardous substances on or from a property At this time we are involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at certain of our present and former facilities In addition there may be soil or groundwater contamination at several of our properties resulting from historical ongoing or nearby activities At December 31 2017  2016 and 2015  the undiscounted reserve for environmental investigation and remediation was approximately 4 million  5 million and 3 million  respectively Additionally as of December 31 2016 and 2015  the undiscounted reserve for environmental investigation and remediation attributable to discontinued operations included within liabilities of discontinued operations was approximately 1 million and 7 million  respectively none of which related to sites within the US We cannot ensure that our eventual environmental remediation costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current reserves In the event that such liabilities were to significantly exceed the amounts recorded our results of operations could be materially affected 13 Table of Contents SUPPLEMENTARY ITEM EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE REGISTRANT The name age as of February 1 2018 current positions and description of business experience of each of our

Contents ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS Set forth below are certain risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition and cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forwardlooking statements made by the Company Also refer to the Cautionary Statement Regarding ForwardLooking Information in this annual report Risks Related to Business Environment and Economic Conditions The cyclical nature of automotive sales and production can adversely affect our business Our business is directly related to automotive sales and automotive vehicle production by our customers Automotive sales and production are highly cyclical and in addition to general economic conditions also depend on other factors such as consumer confidence and consumer preferences Lower global automotive sales would be expected to result in substantially all of our automotive OEM customers lowering vehicle production schedules which has a direct impact on our earnings and cash flows In addition automotive sales and production can be affected by labor relations issues regulatory requirements trade agreements the availability of consumer financing and other factors Economic declines that result in a significant reduction in automotive sales and production by our customers have in the past had and may in the future have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition Our sales are also affected by inventory levels and OEMs production levels We cannot predict when OEMs will decide to increase or decrease inventory levels or whether new inventory levels will approximate historical inventory levels Uncertainty and other unexpected fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition A prolonged economic downturn or economic uncertainty could adversely affect our business and cause us to require additional sources of financing which may not be available Our sensitivity to economic cycles and any related fluctuation in the businesses of our customers or potential customers may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows Due to overall strong global economic conditions in 2017 the automotive industry experienced increased global customer sales and production schedules Compared to 2016 vehicle production in 2017 increased by 4 in Europe 3 in China and 21 in South America However after several years of increases consumer demand for vehicles in North America receded resulting in a 4 decrease in North American production in 2017 as compared to the increased volumes experienced in 2016 As a result we have experienced and may continue to experience reductions in orders from OEM customers in certain regions Uncertainty relating to global or regional economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our business A prolonged downturn in the global or regional automotive industry or a significant change in product mix due to consumer demand could require us to shut down plants or result in impairment charges restructuring actions or changes in our valuation allowances against deferred tax assets which could be material to our financial condition and results of operations If global economic conditions deteriorate or economic uncertainty increases our customers and potential customers may experience deterioration of their businesses which may result in the delay or cancellation of plans to purchase our products If vehicle production were to remain at low levels for an extended period of time or if cash losses for customer defaults rise our cash flow could be adversely impacted which could result in our needing to seek additional financing to continue our operations There can be no assurance that we would be able to secure such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all Any changes in consumer credit availability or cost of borrowing could adversely affect our business Declines in the availability of consumer credit and increases in consumer borrowing costs have negatively impacted global automotive sales and resulted in lower production volumes in the past Substantial declines in automotive sales and production by our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition A drop in the market share and changes in product mix offered by our customers can impact our revenues We are dependent on the continued growth viability and financial stability of our customers Our customers generally are OEMs in the automotive industry This industry is subject to rapid technological change vigorous competition short product life cycles and cyclical and reduced consumer demand patterns When our customers are adversely affected by these factors we may be similarly affected to the extent that our customers reduce the volume of orders for our products As a result of changes impacting our customers sales mix can shift which may have either favorable or unfavorable impact on revenue and would include shifts in regional growth shifts in OEM sales demand as well as shifts in consumer demand related to vehicle segment purchases and content penetration For instance a shift in sales demand favoring a particular OEMs vehicle model for which we do not have a supply contract may negatively impact our revenue A shift in regional sales demand toward certain markets could favorably impact the sales of those of our customers that have a large market share in those regions which in turn would be expected to have a favorable impact on our revenue The mix of vehicle offerings by our OEM customers also impacts our sales A decrease in consumer demand for specific types of vehicles where we have traditionally provided significant content could have a significant effect on our business and 16 Table of Contents financial condition Our sales of products in the regions in which our customers operate also depend on the success of these customers in those regions We operate in the highly competitive automotive technology and component supply industry and are dependent on the acceptance of new product introductions for continued growth The global automotive technology and component supply industry is highly competitive Competition is based primarily on price technology quality delivery and overall customer service There can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with the products of our competitors Furthermore the rapidly evolving nature of the markets in which we compete has attracted and may continue to attract new entrants particularly in countries such as China or in areas of evolving vehicle technologies such as automated driving technologies which have attracted new entrants from outside the traditional automotive supply industry Additionally consolidation in the automotive industry may lead to decreased product purchases from us As a result our sales levels and margins could be adversely affected by pricing pressures from OEMs and pricing actions of competitors These factors led to selective resourcing of business to competitors in the past and may also do so in the future In addition any of our competitors may foresee the course of market development more accurately than us develop products that are superior to our products have the ability to produce similar products at a lower cost than us adapt more quickly than us to new technologies or evolving customer requirements or develop or introduce new products or solutions before we do particularly related to potential transformative technologies such as autonomous driving solutions As a result our products may not be able to compete successfully with their products These trends may adversely affect our sales as well as the profit margins on our products If we do not continue to innovate to develop or acquire new and compelling products that capitalize upon new technologies this could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations If we do not respond appropriately the evolution of the automotive industry towards autonomous vehicles and mobility on demand services could adversely affect our business The automotive industry is increasingly focused on the development of advanced driver assistance technologies with the goal of developing and introducing a commerciallyviable fully automated driving experience The high development cost of active safety and autonomous driving technologies may result in a higher risk of exposure to the success of new or disruptive technologies different than those being developed by us There has also been an increase in consumer preferences for mobility on demand services such as car and ridesharing as opposed to automobile ownership which may result in a long term reduction in the number of vehicles per capita These evolving areas have also attracted increased competition from entrants outside the traditional automotive industry If we do not continue to innovate to develop or acquire new and compelling products that capitalize upon new technologies in response to OEM and consumer preferences this could have an adverse impact on our results of operations We have invested substantial resources in markets and technologies where we expect growth and we may be unable to timely alter our strategies should such expectations not be realized Our future growth is dependent on our making the right investments at the right time to support product development and manufacturing capacity in geographic areas where we can support our customer base and in product areas of evolving vehicle technologies We have identified the Asia Pacific region and more specifically China as a key geographic market and have identified advanced driver assistance systems autonomous driving technologies and mobility solutions as a key product market We believe these markets are likely to experience substantial long term growth and accordingly have made and expect to continue to make substantial investments both directly and through participation in various partnerships and joint ventures in numerous manufacturing operations technical centers research and development activities and other infrastructure to support anticipated growth in these areas If we are unable to deepen existing and develop additional customer relationships in the Asia Pacific region or if we are unable to develop and introduce marketrelevant advanced driver assistance or autonomous driving technologies we may not only fail to realize expected rates of return on our existing investments but we may incur losses on such investments and be unable to timely redeploy the invested capital to take advantage of other markets or product categories potentially resulting in lost market share to our competitors Our results will also suffer if these areas do not grow as quickly as we anticipate 17 Table of Contents We may not be able to respond quickly enough to changes in regulations technology and technological risks and to develop our intellectual property into commercially viable products Changes in legislative regulatory or industry requirements or in competitive technologies may render certain of our products obsolete or less attractive Our ability to anticipate changes in technology and regulatory standards and to successfully develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis are significant factors in our ability to remain competitive and to maintain or increase our revenues For example the evolving sector of automated driver assistance and autonomous driving technologies has led to evolving guidance issued by the US Department of Transportation DOT regarding best practices for the testing and deployment of automated driving systems and outlining federal and state roles in the regulation of these systems including providing state legislatures with best practices on how to safely foster the development and introduction of automated driving technologies onto public roads There remains potential for the continued introduction of new and expanded regulations in this space including potential requirements for autonomous vehicle systems to receive approval from the DOT or other regulatory agencies prior to commercial introduction It is also possible that regulations in this space may diverge among jurisdictions leading to increased compliance costs We cannot provide assurance that certain of our products will not become obsolete or that we will be able to achieve the technological advances that may be necessary for us to remain competitive and maintain or increase our revenues in the future We are also subject to the risks generally associated with new product introductions and applications including lack of market acceptance delays in product development or production and failure of products to operate properly The pace of our development and introduction of new and improved products depends on our ability to implement successfully improved technological innovations in design engineering and manufacturing which requires extensive capital investment Any capital expenditure cuts in these areas that we may determine to implement in the future to reduce costs and conserve cash could reduce our ability to develop and implement improved technological innovations which may materially reduce demand for our products To compete effectively in the automotive supply industry we must be able to launch new products to meet changing consumer preferences and our customers demand in a timely and costeffective manner Our ability to respond to competitive pressures and react quickly to other major changes in the marketplace including the potential introduction of disruptive technologies such as autonomous driving solutions or consumer desire for and availability of vehicles with advanced driver assistance technologies or which use alternative fuels is also a risk to our future financial performance We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to install and certify the equipment needed to produce products for new product programs in time for the start of production or that the transitioning of our manufacturing facilities and resources to full production under new product programs will not impact production rates or other operational efficiency measures at our facilities Development and manufacturing schedules are difficult to predict and we cannot provide assurance that our customers will execute on schedule the launch of their new product programs for which we might supply products Our failure to successfully launch new products or a failure by our customers to successfully launch new programs could adversely affect our results Certain of our businesses rely on relationships with collaborative partners and other thirdparties for development of certain products and potential products and such collaborative partners or other thirdparties could fail to perform sufficiently We believe that for certain of our businesses success in developing marketrelevant products depends in part on their ability to develop and maintain collaborative relationships with other companies There are certain risks involved in such relationships as our collaborative partners may not devote sufficient resources to the success of our collaborations may be acquired by other companies and subsequently terminate our collaborative arrangement may compete with us may not agree with us on key details of the collaborative relationship or may not agree to renew existing collaborations on acceptable terms Because these and other factors may be beyond our control the development or commercialization of our products involved in collaborative partnerships may be delayed or otherwise adversely affected If we or any of our collaborative partners terminate a collaborative arrangement we may be required to devote additional resources to product development and commercialization or may need to cancel certain development programs which could adversely affect our business and operational results Declines in the market share or business of our five largest customers may have a disproportionate adverse impact on our revenues and profitability Our five largest customers accounted for approximately 41 of our total net sales in the year ended December 31 2017  Accordingly our revenues may be disproportionately affected by decreases in any of their businesses or market share Because our customers typically have no obligation to purchase a specific quantity of parts a decline in the production levels of any of our major customers particularly with respect to models for which we are a significant supplier could disproportionately reduce our sales and thereby adversely affect our financial condition operating results and cash flows See Item 1 Supply Relationships with Our Customers 18 Table of Contents Our business in China is subject to aggressive competition and is sensitive to economic and market conditions Maintaining a strong position in the Chinese market is a key component of our global growth strategy The automotive supply market in China is highly competitive with competition from many of the largest global manufacturers and numerous smaller domestic manufacturers As the size of the Chinese market continues to increase over the long term we anticipate that additional competitors both international and domestic will seek to enter the Chinese market and that existing market participants will act aggressively to increase their market share Increased competition may result in price reductions reduced margins and our inability to gain or hold market share Additionally there have been periods of increased market volatility and moderations in the level of economic growth in China which resulted in periods of lower automotive production growth rates in China than those previously experienced For example in 2016 automotive production in China increased 15 as compared to 2015 benefiting in part from a consumer vehicle tax reduction program Following a partial increase in the consumer vehicle tax in 2017 vehicle production volumes in China increased by 3 in 2017 Our business in China is sensitive to economic and market conditions that drive automotive sales volumes in China and may be impacted if there are reductions in vehicle demand in China If we are unable to maintain our position in the Chinese market or if vehicle sales in China decrease or do not continue to increase our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected We may not realize sales represented by awarded business We estimate awarded business using certain assumptions including projected future sales volumes Our customers generally do not guarantee volumes In addition awarded business may include business under arrangements that our customers have the right to terminate without penalty Therefore our actual sales volumes and thus the ultimate amount of revenue that we derive from such sales are not committed If actual production orders from our customers are not consistent with the projections we use in calculating the amount of our awarded business we could realize substantially less revenue over the life of these projects than the currently projected estimate Continued pricing pressures OEM cost reduction initiatives and the ability of OEMs to resource or cancel vehicle programs may result in lower than anticipated margins or losses which may have a significant negative impact on our business Costcutting initiatives adopted by our customers result in increased downward pressure on pricing Our customer supply agreements generally require stepdowns in component pricing over the period of production typically one to two percent per year In addition our customers often reserve the right to terminate their supply contracts for convenience which enhances their ability to obtain price reductions OEMs have also possessed significant leverage over their suppliers including us because the automotive component supply industry is highly competitive serves a limited number of customers has a high fixed cost base and historically has had excess capacity Based on these factors and the fact that our customers product programs typically last a number of years and are anticipated to encompass large volumes our customers are able to negotiate favorable pricing Accordingly as a Tier I supplier we are subject to substantial continuing pressure from OEMs to reduce the price of our products For example our customer supply agreements generally provide for annual reductions in pricing of our products over the period of production It is possible that pricing pressures beyond our expectations could intensify as OEMs pursue restructuring and cost cutting initiatives If we are unable to generate sufficient production cost savings in the future to offset price reductions our gross margin and profitability would be adversely affected See Item 1 Supply Relationships with Our Customers for a detailed discussion of our supply agreements with our customers Our supply agreements with our OEM customers are generally requirements contracts and a decline in the production requirements of any of our customers and in particular our largest customers could adversely impact our revenues and profitability We receive OEM purchase orders for specific components supplied for particular vehicles In most instances our OEM customers agree to purchase their requirements for specific products but are not required to purchase any minimum amount of products from us The contracts we have entered into with most of our customers have terms ranging from one year to the life of the model usually three to seven years although customers often reserve the right to terminate for convenience Therefore a significant decrease in demand for certain key models or group of related models sold by any of our major customers or the ability of a manufacturer to resource and discontinue purchasing from us for a particular model or group of models could have a material adverse effect on us To the extent that we do not maintain our existing level of business with our largest customers because of a decline in their production requirements or because the contracts expire or are terminated for convenience we will need to attract new customers or win new business with existing customers or our results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected See Item 1 Supply Relationships with Our Customers for a detailed discussion of our supply agreements with our customers 19 Table of Contents Disruptions in the supply of raw materials and other supplies that we and our customers use in our products may adversely affect our profitability We and our customers use a broad range of materials and supplies including copper and other metals petroleumbased resins chemicals electronic components and semiconductors A significant disruption in the supply of these materials for any reason could decrease our production and shipping levels which could materially increase our operating costs and materially decrease our profit margins We as with other component manufacturers in the automotive industry ship products to our customers vehicle assembly plants throughout the world so they are delivered on a justintime basis in order to maintain low inventory levels Our suppliers also use a similar method However this justintime method makes the logistics supply chain in our industry very complex and very vulnerable to disruptions Such disruptions could be caused by any one of a myriad of potential problems such as closures of one of our or our suppliers plants or critical manufacturing lines due to strikes mechanical breakdowns electrical outages fires explosions or political upheaval as well as logistical complications due to weather global climate change volcanic eruptions or other natural or nuclear disasters mechanical failures delayed customs processing and more Additionally as we grow in best cost countries the risk for such disruptions is heightened The lack of even a small single subcomponent necessary to manufacture one of our products for whatever reason could force us to cease production even for a prolonged period Similarly a potential quality issue could force us to halt deliveries while we validate the products Even where products are ready to be shipped or have been shipped delays may arise before they reach our customer Our customers may halt or delay their production for the same reason if one of their other suppliers fails to deliver necessary components This may cause our customers in turn to suspend their orders or instruct us to suspend delivery of our products which may adversely affect our financial performance When we fail to make timely deliveries in accordance with our contractual obligations we generally have to absorb our own costs for identifying and solving the root cause problem as well as expeditiously producing replacement components or products Generally we must also carry the costs associated with catching up such as overtime and premium freight Additionally if we are the cause for a customer being forced to halt production the customer may seek to recoup all of its losses and expenses from us These losses and expenses could be significant and may include consequential losses such as lost profits Any supplychain disruption however small could potentially cause the complete shutdown of an assembly line of one of our customers and any such shutdown that is due to causes that are within our control could expose us to material claims of compensation Where a customer halts production because of another supplier failing to deliver on time it is unlikely we will be fully compensated if at all Adverse developments affecting one or more of our suppliers could harm our profitability Any significant disruption in our supplier relationships particularly relationships with solesource suppliers could harm our profitability Furthermore some of our suppliers may not be able to handle the commodity cost volatility andor sharply changing volumes while still performing as we expect To the extent our suppliers experience supply disruptions there is a risk for delivery delays production delays production issues or delivery of nonconforming products by our suppliers Even where these risks do not materialize we may incur costs as we try to make contingency plans for such risks The loss of business with respect to or the lack of commercial success of a vehicle model for which we are a significant supplier could adversely affect our financial performance Although we receive purchase orders from our customers these purchase orders generally provide for the supply of a customers requirements for a particular vehicle model and assembly plant rather than for the purchase of a specific quantity of products The loss of business with respect to or the lack of commercial success of a vehicle model for which we are a significant supplier could reduce our sales and thereby adversely affect our financial condition operating results and cash flows Increases in costs of the materials and other supplies that we use in our products may have a negative impact on our business Significant changes in the markets where we purchase materials components and supplies for the production of our products may adversely affect our profitability particularly in the event of significant increases in demand where there is not a corresponding increase in supply inflation or other pricing increases In recent periods there have been significant fluctuations in the global prices of copper and petroleumbased resin products and fuel charges which have had and may continue to have an unfavorable impact on our business results of operations or financial condition Continuing volatility may have adverse effects on our business results of operations or financial condition We will continue efforts to pass some supply and material cost increases onto our customers although competitive and market pressures have limited our ability to do that particularly with domestic OEMs and may prevent us from doing so in the future because our customers are generally not obligated to accept price increases that we may desire to pass along to them Even where we are able to pass price increases through to the 20 Table of Contents customer in some cases there is a lapse of time before we are able to do so The inability to pass on price increases to our customers when raw material prices increase rapidly or to significantly higher than historic levels could adversely affect our operating margins and cash flow possibly resulting in lower operating income and profitability We expect to be continually challenged as demand for our principal raw materials and other supplies including electronic components is significantly impacted by demand in emerging markets particularly in China We cannot provide assurance that fluctuations in commodity prices will not otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations or cause significant fluctuations in quarterly and annual results of operations Our hedging activities to address commodity price fluctuations may not be successful in offsetting future increases in those costs or may reduce or eliminate the benefits of any decreases in those costs In order to mitigate shortterm volatility in operating results due to the aforementioned commodity price fluctuations we hedge a portion of nearterm exposure to certain raw materials used in production The results of our hedging practice could be positive neutral or negative in any period depending on price changes in the hedged exposures Our hedging activities are not designed to mitigate longterm commodity price fluctuations and therefore will not protect from longterm commodity price increases Our future hedging positions may not correlate to actual raw material costs which could cause acceleration in the recognition of unrealized gains and losses on hedging positions in operating results We may encounter manufacturing challenges The volume and timing of sales to our customers may vary due to variation in demand for our customers products our customers attempts to manage their inventory design changes changes in our customers manufacturing strategy and acquisitions of or consolidations among customers Due in part to these factors many of our customers do not commit to longterm production schedules Our inability to forecast the level of customer orders with certainty makes it difficult to schedule production and maximize utilization of manufacturing capacity We rely on thirdparty suppliers for the components used in our products and we rely on thirdparty manufacturers to manufacture certain of our assemblies and finished products Our results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected if our third party suppliers lack sufficient quality control or if there are significant changes in their financial or business condition If our thirdparty manufacturers fail to deliver products parts and components of sufficient quality on time and at reasonable prices we could have difficulties fulfilling our orders sales and profits could decline and our commercial reputation could be damaged From time to time we have underutilized our manufacturing lines This excess capacity means we incur increased fixed costs in our products relative to the net revenue we generate which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations particularly during economic downturns If we are unable to improve utilization levels for these manufacturing lines and correctly manage capacity the increased expense levels will have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations In addition some of our manufacturing lines are located in China or other foreign countries that are subject to a number of additional risks and uncertainties including increasing labor costs which may result from market demand or other factors and political social and economic instability Changes in factors that impact the determination of our nonUS pension liabilities may adversely affect us Certain of our nonUS subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans which generally provide benefits based on negotiated amounts for each year of service Our primary funded nonUS plans are located in Mexico and the United Kingdom and were underfunded by 50 million as of December 31 2017  The funding requirements of these benefit plans and the related expense reflected in our financial statements are affected by several factors that are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and volatility including governmental regulation In addition to the defined benefit pension plans we have retirement obligations driven by requirements in many of the countries in which we operate These legally required plans require payments at the time benefits are due Obligations net of plan assets related to the defined benefit pension plans and statutorily required retirement obligations totaled 458 million at December 31 2017  of which 31 million is included in accrued liabilities 431 million is included in longterm liabilities and 4 million is included in longterm assets in our consolidated balance sheet Key assumptions used to value these benefit obligations and the cost of providing such benefits funding requirements and expense recognition include the discount rate and the expected longterm rate of return on pension assets If the actual trends in these factors are less favorable than our assumptions this could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition We may suffer future asset impairment and other restructuring charges including write downs of longlived assets goodwill or intangible assets We have taken are taking and may take future restructuring actions to realign and resize our production capacity and cost structure to meet current and projected operational and market requirements Charges related to these actions or any further restructuring actions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition We cannot assure that any current or future restructuring will be completed as planned or achieve the desired results 21 Table of Contents Additionally from time to time in the past we have recorded asset impairment losses relating to specific plants and operations Generally we record asset impairment losses when we determine that our estimates of the future undiscounted cash flows from an operation will not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of that facilitys building fixed assets and production tooling For goodwill we perform a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting units value is less than its carrying amount If the qualitative assessment is not met the Company then performs a quantitative assessment by first comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we compare its implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value the reporting unit would recognize an impairment loss for that excess We cannot ensure that we will not incur such charges in the future as changes in economic or operating conditions impacting the estimates and assumptions could result in additional impairment Employee strikes and laborrelated disruptions involving us or one or more of our customers or suppliers may adversely affect our operations Our business is laborintensive and utilizes a number of work councils and other represented employees A strike or other form of significant work disruption by our employees would likely have an adverse effect on our ability to operate our business A labor dispute involving us or one or more of our customers or suppliers or that could otherwise affect our operations could reduce our sales and harm our profitability A labor dispute involving another supplier to our customers that results in a slowdown or a closure of our customers assembly plants where our products are included in the assembled parts or vehicles could also adversely affect our business and harm our profitability In addition our inability or the inability of any of our customers our suppliers or our customers suppliers to negotiate an extension of a collective bargaining agreement upon its expiration could reduce our sales and harm our profitability Significant increases in labor costs as a result of the renegotiation of collective bargaining agreements could also adversely affect our business and harm our profitability We may lose or fail to attract and retain key salaried employees and management personnel An important aspect of our competitiveness is our ability to attract and retain key salaried employees and management personnel Our ability to do so is influenced by a variety of factors including the compensation we award and the competitive market position of our overall compensation package We may not be as successful as competitors at recruiting assimilating and retaining highly skilled personnel The loss of the services of any member of senior management or a key salaried employee could have an adverse effect on our business We are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations as a result of our substantial global operations which may affect our financial results We have currency exposures related to buying selling and financing in currencies other than the local currencies of the countries in which we operate Approximately 64 of our net revenue for the year ended December 31 2017 came from sales outside the United States which were primarily invoiced in currencies other than the US dollar and we expect net revenue from nonUS markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our net revenue Accordingly significant changes in currency exchange rates particularly the Euro and Chinese Yuan Renminbi could cause fluctuations in the reported results of our businesses operations that could negatively affect our results of operations Price increases caused by currency exchange rate fluctuations may make our products less competitive or have an adverse effect on our margins Currency exchange rate fluctuations may also disrupt the business of our suppliers by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance Historically we have reduced our exposure by aligning our costs in the same currency as our revenues or if that is impracticable through financial instruments that provide offsets or limits to our exposures which are opposite to the underlying transactions However any measures that we may implement to reduce the effect of volatile currencies and other risks of our global operations may not be effective In addition we have significant business in Europe and transact much of this business in the Euro currency including sales and purchase contracts Although not as prevalent currently concerns over the stability of the Euro currency and the economic outlook for many European countries including those that do not use the Euro as their currency persist Given the broad range of possible outcomes it is difficult to fully assess the implications on our business Some of the potential outcomes could significantly impact our operations In the event of a country redenominating its currency away from the Euro the potential impact could be material to operations We cannot provide assurance that fluctuations in currency exposures will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations or cause significant fluctuations in quarterly and annual results of operations We face risks associated with doing business in nonUS jurisdictions The majority of our manufacturing and distribution facilities are in countries outside of the US including Mexico China and other countries in Asia Pacific Eastern and Western Europe South America and Northern Africa We also purchase raw materials and other supplies from many different countries around the world For the year ended December 31 2017  22 Table of Contents approximately 64 of our net revenue came from sales outside the United States International operations are subject to certain risks inherent in doing business abroad including  exposure to local economic political and labor conditions  unexpected changes in laws regulations trade or monetary or fiscal policy including interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and changes in the rate of inflation in the US and other foreign countries  tariffs quotas customs and other import or export restrictions and other trade barriers  expropriation and nationalization  difficulty of enforcing agreements collecting receivables and protecting assets through nonUS legal systems  reduced intellectual property protection  limitations on repatriation of earnings  withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries  investment restrictions or requirements  export and import restrictions  violence and civil unrest in local countries and  compliance with the requirements of an increasing body of applicable antibribery laws including the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act the UK Bribery Act and similar laws of various other countries Additionally our global operations may also be adversely affected by political events domestic or international terrorist events and hostilities or complications due to natural or nuclear disasters These uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on the continuity of our business and our results of operations and financial condition Existing free trade laws and regulations such as the North American Free Trade Agreement provide certain beneficial duties and tariffs for qualifying imports and exports subject to compliance with the applicable classification and other requirements Changes in laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade and in particular increased trade restrictions tariffs or taxes on imports from countries where we manufacture products such as China and Mexico could have a material adverse affect on our business and financial results Increasing our manufacturing footprint in Asian markets including China and our business relationships with Asian automotive manufacturers are important elements of our long term strategy In addition our strategy includes increasing revenue and expanding our manufacturing footprint in lowercost regions As a result our exposure to the risks described above may be greater in the future The likelihood of such occurrences and their potential impact on us vary from country to country and are unpredictable The results of the Referendum of the United Kingdoms Membership of the European Union may adversely affect our business and profitability There have also been periods of increased market volatility and currency exchange rate fluctuations both globally and most specifically within the United Kingdom UK and Europe as a result of the UK referendum held on June 23 2016 in which voters approved an exit from the European Union EU commonly referred to as Brexit As a result of the referendum the British government formally initiated the process for withdrawal in March 2017 The terms of any withdrawal are subject to a negotiation period that could last at least two years from the initiation date Nevertheless the proposed withdrawal has created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the UK and the EU These developments or the perception that any of them could occur may adversely affect European and worldwide economic and market conditions significantly reduce global market liquidity and restrict the ability of key market participants to operate in certain financial markets and could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets including increased volatility in interest rates and foreign exchange rates Although we are actively monitoring the ongoing potential impacts of Brexit and will seek to minimize its impact on our business any of these effects of Brexit among others could adversely affect our business business opportunities results of operations financial condition and cash flows Approximately 1 of our annual net sales are generated in the UK and less than 1 are denominated in British pounds If we fail to manage our growth effectively or to integrate successfully any new or future business ventures acquisitions or strategic alliance into our business our business could be materially adversely harmed We have completed a number of acquisitions in recent years most recently the acquisition of nuTonomy Inc and we expect to continue to pursue business ventures acquisitions and strategic alliances that leverage our technology capabilities enhance our customer base geographic penetration and scale to complement our current businesses and we regularly evaluate potential opportunities some of which could be material While we believe that such transactions are an integral part of our longterm strategy there are risks and uncertainties related to these activities Assessing a potential growth opportunity involves 23 Table of Contents extensive due diligence However the amount of information we can obtain about a potential growth opportunity may be limited and we can give no assurance that new business ventures acquisitions and strategic alliances will positively affect our financial performance or will perform as planned We may not be able to successfully assimilate or integrate companies that we acquire including their personnel financial systems distribution operations and general operating procedures We may also encounter challenges in achieving appropriate internal control over financial reporting in connection with the integration of an acquired company If we fail to assimilate or integrate acquired companies successfully our business reputation and operating results could be materially impacted Likewise our failure to integrate and manage acquired companies successfully may lead to future impairment of any associated goodwill and intangible asset balances We depend on information technology to conduct our business Any significant disruption could impact our business Our ability to keep our business operating effectively depends on the functional and efficient operation of information technology and telecommunications systems We rely on these systems to make a variety of daytoday business decisions as well as to track transactions billings payments and inventory Our systems as well as those of our customers suppliers partners and service providers are susceptible to interruptions including those caused by systems failures cyber attack malicious computer software malware and other natural or manmade incidents or disasters which may be prolonged We are also susceptible to security breaches that may go undetected Although we have taken precautions to mitigate such events including geographically diverse data centers redundant infrastructure and the implementation of security measures a significant or largescale interruption of our information technology could adversely affect our ability to manage and keep our operations running efficiently and effectively An incident that results in a wider or sustained disruption to our business or products could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations Additionally certain of our products contain complex information technology systems designed to support todays increasingly connected vehicles and could be susceptible to similar interruptions including the possibility of unauthorized access Although we have designed and implemented security measures to prevent such unauthorized access there can be no assurance that vulnerabilities will not be identified in the future or that our security efforts are or will be successful Any unauthorized access to our components could negatively affect our brand and harm our business prospects financial condition and operating results Risks Related to Legal Regulatory Tax and Accounting Matters We may incur material losses and costs as a result of warranty claims product recalls product liability and intellectual property infringement actions that may be brought against us We face an inherent business risk of exposure to warranty claims and product liability in the event that our products fail to perform as expected and in the case of product liability such failure of our products results in bodily injury andor property damage The fabrication of the products we manufacture is a complex and precise process Our customers specify quality performance and reliability standards If flaws in either the design or manufacture of our products were to occur we could experience a rate of failure in our products that could result in significant delays in shipment and product rework or replacement costs Although we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes these may not be sufficient to avoid product failures which could cause us to  lose net revenue  incur increased costs such as warranty expense and costs associated with customer support  experience delays cancellations or rescheduling of orders for our products  experience increased product returns or discounts or  damage our reputation all of which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations If any of our products are or are alleged to be defective we may be required to participate in a recall involving such products Each vehicle manufacturer has its own practices regarding product recalls and other product liability actions relating to its suppliers However as suppliers become more integrally involved in the vehicle design process and assume more of the vehicle assembly functions OEMs continue to look to their suppliers for contribution when faced with recalls and product liability claims A recall claim brought against us or a product liability claim brought against us in excess of our available insurance may have a material adverse effect on our business OEMs also require their suppliers to guarantee or warrant their products and bear the costs of repair and replacement of such products under new vehicle warranties Depending on the terms under which we supply products to a vehicle manufacturer a vehicle manufacturer may attempt to hold us responsible for some or all of the repair or replacement costs of defective products under new vehicle warranties when the OEM asserts that the product supplied did not perform as warranted Although we cannot assure that the future costs of warranty claims by our customers will not be material we believe our established reserves are adequate to cover potential warranty settlements Our warranty reserves are based on our best estimates of amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims We regularly 24 Table of Contents evaluate the level of these reserves and adjust them when appropriate However the final amounts determined to be due related to these matters could differ materially from our recorded estimates In addition as we adopt new technology we face an inherent risk of exposure to the claims of others that we have allegedly violated their intellectual property rights We cannot assure that we will not experience any material warranty product liability or intellectual property claim losses in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to defend such claims We may be adversely affected by laws or regulations including environmental regulation litigation or other liabilities We are subject to various US federal state and local and nonUS laws and regulations including those related to environmental health and safety financial and other matters We cannot predict the substance or impact of pending or future legislation or regulations or the application thereof The introduction of new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or the interpretations thereof could increase the costs of doing business for us or our customers or suppliers or restrict our actions and adversely affect our financial condition operating results and cash flows We are subject to regulation governing among other things  the generation storage handling use transportation presence of or exposure to hazardous materials  the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground air or water  the incorporation of certain chemical substances into our products including electronic equipment and  the health and safety of our employees We are also required to obtain permits from governmental authorities for certain operations We cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with such laws regulations and permits If we violate or fail to comply with these laws regulations or permits we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators We could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances or other environmental damage Certain environmental laws impose liability sometimes regardless of fault for investigating or cleaning up contamination on or emanating from our currently or formerly owned leased or operated property as well as for damages to property or natural resources and for personal injury arising out of such contamination Some of these environmental laws may also assess liability on persons who arrange for hazardous substances to be sent to third party disposal or treatment facilities when such facilities are found to be contaminated At this time we are involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at a number of present and former facilities The ultimate cost to us of site cleanups is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup the potential for ongoing environmental monitoring and maintenance that could be required for many years the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations alternative cleanup methods and potential agreements that could be reached with governmental and third parties While we have environmental reserves of approximately 4 million at December 31 2017 for the cleanup of presentlyknown environmental contamination conditions it cannot be guaranteed that actual costs will not significantly exceed these reserves We also could be named as a potentially responsible party at additional sites in the future and the costs associated with such future sites may be material In addition environmental laws are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time While we have budgeted for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with environmental laws we cannot assure that environmental laws will not change or become more stringent in the future Therefore we cannot assure that our costs of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety laws and our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposure to hazardous substances will not adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition For example adoption of greenhouse gas rules in jurisdictions in which we operate facilities could require installation of emission controls acquisition of emission credits emission reductions or other measures that could be costly and could also impact utility rates and increase the amount we spend annually for energy We may identify the need for additional environmental remediation or demolition obligations relating to facility divestiture closure and decommissioning activities As we sell close andor demolish facilities around the world environmental investigations and assessments will continue to be performed We may identify previously unknown environmental conditions or further delineate known conditions that may require remediation or additional costs related to demolition or decommissioning such as abatement of asbestos containing materials or removal of storage tanks Such costs could exceed our reserves 25 Table of Contents We are involved from time to time in legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes which could have an adverse impact on our profitability and consolidated financial position We are involved in legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes that from time to time are significant These are typically claims that arise in the normal course of business including without limitation commercial or contractual disputes including warranty claims and other disputes with customers and suppliers intellectual property matters personal injury claims environmental issues tax matters and employment matters In addition we conduct significant business operations in Brazil that are subject to the Brazilian federal labor social security environmental tax and customs laws as well as a variety of state and local laws While we believe we comply with such laws they are complex subject to varying interpretations and we are often engaged in litigation with government agencies regarding the application of these laws to particular circumstances As of December 31 2017  the majority of claims asserted against Aptiv in Brazil relate to such litigation The remaining claims relate to commercial and labor litigation with private parties in Brazil As of December 31 2017  claims totaling approximately 185 million using December 31 2017 foreign currency rates have been asserted against Aptiv in Brazil As of December 31 2017  we maintained reserves for these asserted claims of approximately 25 million using December 31 2017 foreign currency rates While we believe our reserves are adequate the final amounts required to resolve these matters could differ materially from our recorded estimates and our results of operations could be materially affected For further information regarding our legal matters see Item 3 Legal Proceedings No assurance can be given that such proceedings and claims will not have a material adverse effect on our profitability and consolidated financial position Potential indemnification liabilities pursuant to the 2017 spinoff of Delphi Technologies could materially and adversely affect our business In connection with the Separation we entered into a Separation and Distribution Agreement and related agreements with Delphi Technologies to govern the Separation and the relationship between the two companies following the completion of the Separation These agreements provide for specific indemnity and liability obligations of each party and could lead to disputes between us If we are required to indemnify the other parties under the circumstances set forth in these agreements we may be subject to future liabilities In addition with respect to the liabilities for which the other parties have agreed to indemnify us under these agreements there can be no assurance that the indemnity rights we have against such other parties will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of the liabilities or that such other parties will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations It is also possible that a court could disregard the allocation of assets and liabilities agreed to between Apitv and such other parties and require Aptiv to assume responsibility for obligations allocated to such other parties Each of these risks could negatively affect our business and financial statements Developments or assertions by us or against us relating to intellectual property rights could materially impact our business We own significant intellectual property including a large number of patents and tradenames and are involved in numerous licensing arrangements Our intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets we serve Developments or assertions by or against us relating to intellectual property rights could negatively impact our business Significant technological developments by others also could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations and financial condition Taxing authorities could challenge our historical and future tax positions Our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory rates and changes in tax laws or their interpretation including changes related to tax holidays or tax incentives Our taxes could increase if certain tax holidays or incentives are not renewed upon expiration or if tax rates or regimes applicable to us in such jurisdictions are otherwise increased The amount of tax we pay is subject to our interpretation of applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we file We have taken and will continue to take tax positions based on our interpretation of such tax laws Additionally in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from tax examinations While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of the resolution of a tax examination our reserves for uncertain tax benefits reflect the outcome of tax positions that are more likely than not to occur While we believe that we have complied with all applicable tax laws there can be no assurance that a taxing authority will not have a different interpretation of the law and assess us with additional taxes Should additional taxes be assessed this may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 26 Table of Contents ITEM 1B UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS We have no unresolved SEC staff comments to report ITEM 2 PROPERTIES As of December 31 2017  we owned or leased 109 major manufacturing sites and 14 major technical centers A manufacturing site may include multiple plants and may be wholly or partially owned or leased We also have many smaller manufacturing sites sales offices warehouses engineering centers joint ventures and other investments strategically located throughout the world We have a presence in 45 countries The following table shows the regional distribution of our major manufacturing sites by the operating segment that uses such facilities North America Europe Middle East  Africa Asia Pacific South America Total Signal and Power Solutions 34 34 25 5 98 Advanced Safety and User Experience 2 6 3  11 Total 36 40 28 5 109 In addition to these manufacturing sites we had 14 major technical centers eight in North America two in Europe Middle East and Africa and four in Asia Pacific Of our 109 major manufacturing sites and 14 major technical centers which include facilities owned or leased by our consolidated subsidiaries 53 are primarily owned and 70 are primarily leased We frequently review our real estate portfolio and develop footprint strategies to support our customers global plans while at the same time supporting our technical needs and controlling operating expenses We believe our evolving portfolio will meet current and anticipated future needs ITEM 3 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS We are from time to time subject to various actions claims suits government investigations and other proceedings incidental to our business including those arising out of alleged defects breach of contracts competition and antitrust matters product warranties intellectual property matters personal injury claims and employmentrelated matters It is our opinion that the outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows With respect to warranty matters although we cannot ensure that the future costs of warranty claims by customers will not be material we believe our established reserves are adequate to cover potential warranty settlements However the final amounts required to resolve these matters could differ materially from our recorded estimates Unsecured Creditors Litigation Aptiv has been subject to ongoing litigation related to general unsecured claims against the former Delphi Corporation now known as DPHH resulting from that entitys 2005 bankruptcy filing The Fourth Amended and Restated Limited Liability Partnership Agreement of Delphi Automotive LLP the Fourth LLP Agreement was entered into on July 12 2011 by the members of Delphi Automotive LLP in order to position the Company for its initial public offering Under the terms of the Fourth LLP Agreement if cumulative distributions to the members of Delphi Automotive LLP under certain provisions of the Fourth LLP Agreement exceed 72 billion  Aptiv as disbursing agent on behalf of DPHH is required to pay to the holders of allowed general unsecured claims against DPHH 3250 for every 6750 in excess of 72 billion distributed to the members up to a maximum amount of 300 million  In December 2014 a complaint was filed in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York the Bankruptcy Court alleging that the 2011 redemption by Delphi Automotive LLP of the membership interests of GM and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation the PBGC totaling 44 billion and the subsequent repurchase of shares and payment of dividends by Aptiv PLC constituted distributions under the terms of the Fourth LLP Agreement approximating 72 billion  triggering the maximum 300 million distribution to the holders of general unsecured claims In May 2016 the Bankruptcy Court initially denied both parties motions for summary judgment requiring further submissions to the Bankruptcy Court regarding the parties intent with respect to the redemptions of the GM and PBGC membership interests On January 12 2017 the Bankruptcy Court granted summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs ruling that the membership interest redemption payments qualified as distributions which along with share repurchases and dividend 27 Table of Contents payments made by Aptiv count toward the 72 billion threshold and thus the 300 million maximum distribution for general unsecured claims has been triggered In connection with the January 2017 ruling the Company recorded a reserve of 300 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 The reserve was recorded to other expense in the consolidated statement of operations and resulted in a corresponding reduction in earnings per diluted share of approximately 110 for the year ended December 31 2016 In March 2017 the Bankruptcy Court issued a ruling on the application of prejudgment interest owed on the amount of the distribution to be made to the holders of general unsecured claims During the three months ended June 30 2017 Aptiv and the plaintiffs reached an agreement to settle this matter for 310 million which was subsequently approved by the Bankruptcy Court In July 2017 the Company paid the 310 million settlement pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement In accordance with the terms of the settlement agreement the Company recorded a net incremental charge of 10 million to other expense during the year ended December 31 2017 Brazil Matters Aptiv conducts business operations in Brazil that are subject to the Brazilian federal labor social security environmental tax and customs laws as well as a variety of state and local laws While Aptiv believes it complies with such laws they are complex subject to varying interpretations and the Company is often engaged in litigation with government agencies regarding the application of these laws to particular circumstances As of December 31 2017  the majority of claims asserted against Aptiv in Brazil relate to such litigation The remaining claims in Brazil relate to commercial and labor litigation with private parties As of December 31 2017  claims totaling approximately 185 million using December 31 2017 foreign currency rates have been asserted against Aptiv in Brazil As of December 31 2017  the Company maintains accruals for these asserted claims of 25 million using December 31 2017 foreign currency rates The amounts accrued represent claims that are deemed probable of loss and are reasonably estimable based on the Companys analyses and assessment of the asserted claims and prior experience with similar matters While the Company believes its accruals are adequate the final amounts required to resolve these matters could differ materially from the Companys recorded estimates and Aptivs results of operations could be materially affected The Company estimates the reasonably possible loss in excess of the amounts accrued related to these claims to be zero to 160 million  ITEM 4 MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES Not applicable 28 Table of Contents PART II
