contained on our Website is not incorporated by reference in or considered to be a part of this report Our Industry We are a global semiconductor company Semiconductors are components used in a variety of electronic products and systems An integrated circuit IC is a semiconductor device that consists of many interconnected transistors on a single chip Since the invention of the transistor in 1948 improvements in IC process and design technologies have led to the development of smaller more complex and more reliable ICs at a lower costperfunction Computing and Graphics The x86 Microprocessor and Chipset Markets Central Processing Unit CPU  A microprocessor is an IC that serves as the CPU of a computer It generally consists of hundreds of millions or billions of transistors that process data in a serial fashion and control other devices in the system acting as the brain of the computer The performance of a microprocessor is a critical factor impacting the performance of computing and entertainment platforms such as desktop PCs notebooks and workstations The principal elements used to measure CPU performance are workpercycle or how many instructions are executed per cycle clock speed representing the rate at which a CPUs internal logic operates measured in units of gigahertz or billions of cycles per second and power consumption Other factors impacting microprocessor performance include the process technology used in its manufacture the number and type of cores the bit size of its instruction set eg 32bit vs 16bit memory size and data access speed Developments in IC design and manufacturing process technologies have resulted in significant advances in microprocessor performance Since businesses and consumers require greater performance from their computer systems due to the growth of digital data and increasingly sophisticated software applications multicore microprocessors offer enhanced overall system performance and efficiency because computing tasks can be spread across two or more processing cores each of which can execute a task at full speed Multicore microprocessors can simultaneously increase performance of a computer system without greatly increasing the total amount of power consumed and the total amount of heat emitted Businesses and consumers also require computer systems with improved power management technology which helps them to reduce the power consumption of their computer systems enables smaller and more portable form factors and lowers the total cost of ownership Graphics Processing Unit GPU A GPU is a programmable logic chip that renders images animations and video and is increasingly being used to handle general computing tasks GPUs are located in plugin cards as a discrete processor or in a chipset on the motherboard or in the same chip as the CPU as part of an accelerated processing unit APU or System on Chip SoC GPUs on standalone cards or discrete GPUs on the motherboard typically include their own memory while GPUs in the chipset or CPU chip share main memory with the CPU GPUs perform parallel operations on data to render images for the screen and are essential to presenting computer generated images on the screen decoding and rendering animations and video The more sophisticated the GPU the higher 3 the resolution and the faster and smoother moving objects can be displayed on the screen or in a virtual environment virtual and augmented realities In addition to graphics processing the parallel operation of GPUs are used on multiple sets of data increasingly used in vector processor for nongraphics applications that require repetitive computations such as supercomputing deep neural networks artificial and machine intelligence and various embedded applications Accelerated Processing Unit APU Consumers increasingly demand computing devices with improved enduser experience system performance and energy efficiency Consumers also continue to demand thinner and lighter mobile devices with better performance and longer battery life We believe that a computing architecture that optimizes the use of its components can provide these improvements An APU is a processing unit that integrates a CPU and a GPU onto one chip or one piece of silicon along with in some cases other specialpurpose components This integration enhances system performance by offloading selected tasks to the bestsuited component ie the CPU or the GPU to optimize component use increasing the speed of data flow between the CPU and GPU through shared memory and allowing the GPU to function as both a graphics engine and an application accelerator Having the CPU and GPU on the same chip also typically improves energy efficiency by for example eliminating connections between discrete chips Heterogeneous System Architecture HSA describes an industry standard that is an overarching design for having combinations of CPU and GPU processor cores that operate as a unified integrated engine that shares system responsibilities and resources AMD is a founding member of the HSA Foundation a nonprofit organization established to define and promote this open standardsbased approach to heterogeneous computing Heterogeneous computing allows for the elevation of the GPU to the same level of the CPU for memory access queuing and execution This capability allows software programmers to develop applications to more fully utilize graphics capabilities SystemonChip SoC  A SoC is a type of IC with a CPU GPU and other components such as a memory controller and peripheral management comprising a complete computing system on a single chip By combining all of these elements as a SoC system performance and energy efficiency is improved similar to an APU Chipset A chipset is a generic term referring to a collection of system level components that manage data flow among a microprocessor or microprocessors memory and peripherals such as CD ROM drives DVD drives and USB peripherals Chipsets perform essential logic functions balance a systems performance and provide system control and power management functions Some chipsets have graphics capabilities by including an integrated graphics processor IGP within the chipset A chipset with an IGP is known as an IGP chipset IGP chipsets can offer a lower cost reduced power alternative to a discrete GPU and are often also used in smaller form factors Systems that are powered by an APU or by a CPU and discrete GPU combination often do not have a chipset and instead use an AMD Controller Hub chip to perform the functions of a chipset As a result we believe that either an APU and AMD Controller Hub chip combination or a SoC which already includes a chipset will eventually replace the market for IGP chipsets Our x86 Microprocessor and Chipset Products Our microprocessors are incorporated into computing platforms which are a collection of technologies that are designed to work together to provide a more complete computing solution and to enable and advance the computing components We believe that integrated balanced computing platforms consisting of microprocessors chipsets either as discrete devices or integrated into an SoC and GPUs either as discrete GPUs or integrated into an APU or SoC that work together at the system level bring end users improved system stability increased performance and enhanced power efficiency In addition we believe our customers also benefit from an allAMD platform consisting of an APU or CPU a discrete GPU and an AMD Fusion Controller Hub chip when needed as we are able to optimize interoperability provide our customers a single point of contact for the key platform components and enable them to bring the platforms to market faster in a variety of client and server system form factors We currently base our microprocessors and chipsets on the x86 instruction set architecture and AMDs Direct Connect Architecture which connects an onchip memory controller and inputoutput IO channels directly to one or more microprocessor cores We typically integrate two or more processor cores onto a single die and each core has its own dedicated cache which is memory that is located on the semiconductor die permitting quick access to frequently used data and instructions Some of our microprocessors have additional levels of cache such as L2 or secondlevel cache and L3 or thirdlevel cache to enable faster data access and higher performance We focus on continually improving the energy efficiency of our products through our design principles and innovations in power management technology To that end we offer CPUs GPUs APUs SoCs and chipsets with multiple low power 4 states that are designed to utilize lower clock speeds and voltages to reduce processor power consumption during active and idle times The use of intelligent dynamic power management is designed to create lower energy use by allowing compute applications to be completed quickly and efficiently enabling a return to the ultralow power idle state Desktop Our APUs for desktop PCs consist primarily of the AMD ASeries and AMD ESeries APUs We also offer AMD

improved energy efficiency while providing a secure and stable platform to protect customers IT investments Graphics Market The semiconductor graphics market addresses the need for improved visual and data processing in various computing devices Many consumers value a rich visual experience to enable a more compelling and immersive experience and for these consumers the PC has evolved from a traditional data processing and communications device to an entertainment platform As a result visual realism and graphical display capabilities are key product differentiation elements among computing devices This has led to increasing creation and use of processingintensive multimedia content for computing devices including playing games capturing media content viewing online videos editing photos and managing digital content In turn these trends have contributed to higher consumer demand for performance graphics solutions and to manufacturers designing computing devices with these capabilities Our Graphics Products Graphics processing is a fundamental component of almost everything we create and can be found in an APU GPU SoC or a combination of a GPU with one of the other foregoing products working in tandem Our customers generally use our graphics solutions to increase the speed of rendering images to help improve image resolution and color definition and

combines an opensource core and AMD Radeon Pro graphics technologies and performance Our APUs deliver visual processing functionality for value and mainstream PCs by integrating a CPU and a GPU on a single chip while discrete GPUs which are also known as dGPUs offer high performance graphics processing across all platforms AMD Accelerated Parallel Processing or General Purpose GPU GPGPU refers to a set of advanced hardware and software technologies that enable discrete AMD GPUs working in concert with the CPU to accelerate computational tasks beyond traditional CPU processing by utilizing the vast number of discrete GPU cores while working with the CPU to process information cooperatively In addition computing devices with heterogeneous computing features run 5 computationallyintensive tasks more efficiently which we believe provides a superior application experience to the end user Moreover heterogeneous computing allows for the elevation of the GPU to the same level as the CPU for

substantial influence over computer manufacturers and their channels of distribution through various brand and other marketing programs As a result of Intels position in the microprocessor market Intel has been able to control x86 microprocessor and computer system standards and benchmarks and to dictate the type of products the microprocessor market requires of us Intel also dominates the computer system platform which includes core logic chipsets graphics chips motherboards and other components necessary to assemble a computer system OEMs that purchase microprocessors for computer systems are highly dependent on Intel which can make them less innovative on their own and to a large extent can become distributors of Intel technology Additionally Intel is able to drive de facto standards and specifications for x86 microprocessors that could cause us and other companies to have delayed access to such standards As long as Intel remains in this dominant position we may be materially adversely affected by Intels  business practices including rebating and allocation strategies and pricing actions which may limit our market share and margins  product mix and introduction schedules  product bundling marketing and merchandising strategies  exclusivity payments to its current and potential customers and channel partners that require or result in exclusive product arrangements  de facto control over industry standards and heavy influence on PC manufacturers and other PC industry participants including motherboard memory chipset and basic inputoutput system or BIOS suppliers and software companies as well as the graphics interface for Intel platforms and  marketing and advertising expenditures in support of positioning the Intel brand over the brand of its OEM customers Intel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on marketing and research and development than we do We expect Intel to maintain its market position and to continue to invest heavily in marketing research and development new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies To the extent Intel manufactures a significantly larger portion of its microprocessor products using more advanced process technologies or introduces competitive new products into the market before we do we may be more vulnerable to Intels aggressive marketing and pricing strategies for microprocessor products For example Intel has introduced microprocessors for lowcost notebooks similar to products that we offer for lowcost notebooks Intel could also take actions that place our discrete GPUs at a competitive disadvantage including giving one or more of our competitors in the graphics market such as Nvidia Corporation preferential access to its proprietary graphics interface or other useful information Intels position in the microprocessor market and integrated graphics chipset market its introduction of competitive new products its existing relationships with toptier OEMs and its aggressive marketing and pricing strategies could result in lower unit sales and lower average selling prices for our products which could have a material adverse effect on us Other competitors include a variety of companies providing or developing ARMbased designs at relatively low cost and low power processors for the computing market including tablets and thinclient form factors as well as dense servers settop boxes and gaming consoles ARM Holdings designs and licenses its ARM architecture to third parties including us and offers supporting software and services Our ability to compete with companies who use ARMbased solutions depends on our ability to timely design and bring to market energyefficient highperforming products at an attractive price point In the chipset market our competitors include suppliers of IGP chipsets PC manufacturers use IGP chipsets because they typically cost less than traditional discrete GPUs while offering acceptable graphics performance for most mainstream 9 PC users Intel also leverages its dominance in the microprocessor market to sell its IGP chipsets Intel manufactures and sells IGP chipsets bundled with their microprocessors and is our main competitor in this market Competition in the Graphics Markets In the graphics market our competitors include suppliers of discrete graphics embedded graphics processors and IGP chipsets Intel manufactures and sells embedded graphics processors and IGP chipsets and is a dominant competitor with respect to this portion of our business Higher unit shipments of our APUs and Intels integrated graphics may drive computer manufacturers to reduce the number of systems they build paired with discrete graphics components particularly for notebooks because they may offer satisfactory graphics performance for most mainstream PC users at a lower cost Intel could take actions that place our discrete GPUs and IGP chipsets at a competitive disadvantage such as giving one or more of our competitors in the graphics market such as Nvidia Corporation preferential access to its proprietary graphics interface or other useful information Our principal competitor in the graphics market is Nvidia AMD and Nvidia are the two principal companies offering discrete graphics solutions Other competitors include a number of smaller companies which may have greater flexibility to address specific market needs but less financial resources to do so especially as we believe that the growing complexity of graphics processors and the associated research and development costs represent an increasingly higher barrier to entry in this market In the semicustom game console products where graphics performance is critical we compete primarily against Nvidia Research and Development We focus our research and development activities on improving product performance and enhancing product design Our main area of focus is on delivering the next generation of CPU and GPU IP and designing that IP into our SoCs for our next generation of products with in each case improved system performance and performanceperwatt characteristics For example we are focusing on improving the battery life of our APU products for notebooks the power efficiency of our microprocessors for servers and the performance and power efficiency of our discrete GPUs We are also focusing on delivering a range of lowpower integrated platforms to serve key markets including commercial clients mobile computing and gaming We believe that these platforms will bring customers increased performance and energy efficiency We also work with industry leaders on process technology software and other functional intellectual property and with others in the industry and industry consortia to conduct early stage research and development Our research and development expenses for 2016 2015 and 2014 were approximately 10 billion 09 billion and 11 billion respectively For more information see Part II Item 7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations below We conduct product and system research and development activities for our products in the United States with additional design and development engineering teams located in China Canada India Singapore and Taiwan Manufacturing Arrangements and Assembly and Test Facilities ThirdParty Wafer Foundry Facilities GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc  On March 2 2009 we entered into a Wafer Supply Agreement WSA with GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc GF The WSA governs the terms by which we purchase products manufactured by GF a related party to us Pursuant to the WSA we are required to purchase all of our microprocessor and APU product requirements and a certain portion of our GPU product requirements from GF with limited exceptions For more information about the WSA see Part II Item 7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsGLOBALFOUNDRIES below Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company  We also have foundry arrangements with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company TSMC for the production of wafers for certain products Other ThirdParty Manufacturers  We outsource boardlevel graphics product manufacturing to thirdparty manufacturers Assembly Test Mark and Packaging Facilities 10 Wafers for our products are delivered from thirdparty foundries to our test assembly and packaging partners located in the AsiaPacific region who package and test our final semiconductor products On April 29 2016 we and certain of our subsidiaries completed the sale of a majority of the equity interests in two of our assembly test mark and packaging facilities Suzhou TFAMD Semiconductor Co Ltd formerly AMD Technologies China Co Ltd and TF AMD Microelectronics Penang Sdn Bhd formerly Advanced Micro Devices Export Sdn Bhd to affiliates of Tongfu Fujitsu Microelectronics Co Ltd or TFME formerly Nantong Fujitsu Microelectronics Co Ltd to form two joint ventures each an ATMP JV As a result of the sale TFMEs affiliates own 85 of the equity interests in each ATMP JV while certain of our subsidiaries own the remaining 15 Intellectual Property and Licensing We rely on contracts and intellectual property rights to protect our products and technologies from unauthorized thirdparty copying and use Intellectual property rights include copyrights patents patent applications trademarks trade secrets and mask work rights As of December 31 2016 we had approximately 5033 patents in the United States and approximately 913 patent applications pending in the United States In certain cases we have filed corresponding applications in foreign jurisdictions Including United States and foreign matters we have approximately 10767 patent matters worldwide consisting of approximately 7814 issued patents and 2953 patent applications pending We expect to file future patent applications in both the United States and abroad on significant inventions as we deem appropriate We do not believe that any individual patent or the expiration of any patent is or would be material to our business As is typical in the semiconductor industry we have numerous crosslicensing and technology exchange agreements with other companies under which we both transfer and receive technology and intellectual property rights One such agreement is the crosslicense agreement that we entered into with Intel on November 11 2009 Under the crosslicense agreement we granted to Intel and Intel granted to us nonexclusive royaltyfree licenses to all of each others patents that were first filed no later than November 11 2014 and each party can exploit these patents anywhere in the world for making and selling certain semiconductor and electronicrelated products Under the crosslicense agreement Intel has rights to make semiconductor products for third parties but the thirdparty product designs are not licensed as a result of such manufacture We have rights to perform assembly and testing for third parties but not rights to make semiconductor products for third parties The term of the crosslicense agreement continues until the expiration of the last to expire of the licensed patents unless earlier terminated A party can terminate the crosslicense agreement or the rights and licenses of the other party if the other party materially breaches the crosslicense agreement and does not correct the noticed material breach within 60 days Upon such termination the terminated partys license rights terminate but the terminating partys license rights continue subject to that partys continued compliance with the terms of the crosslicense agreement The crosslicense agreement will automatically terminate if a party undergoes a change of control as defined in the cross license agreement and both parties licenses will terminate Upon the bankruptcy of a party that party may assume but may not assign the crosslicense agreement and in the event that the crosslicense agreement cannot be assumed the crosslicense agreement and the licenses granted will terminate Backlog Sales are made primarily pursuant to purchase orders for current delivery or agreements covering purchases over a period of time Some of these orders or agreements may be revised or canceled without penalty Generally in light of current industry practice we do not believe that such orders or agreements provide meaningful backlog figures or are necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period Seasonality Our operating results tend to vary seasonally For example historically first quarter PC product sales are generally lower than fourth quarter sales In addition with respect to our semicustom SoC products for game consoles we expect sales patterns to follow the seasonal trends of a consumer business with sales in the first half of the year being lower than sales in the second half of the year Employees As of December 31 2016 we had approximately 8200 employees Environmental Regulations Our operations and properties have in the past been and continue to be subject to various United States and foreign environmental laws and regulations including those relating to materials used in our products and manufacturing processes 11 discharge of pollutants into the environment the treatment transport storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and remediation of contamination These laws and regulations require us to obtain permits for our operations including the discharge of air pollutants and wastewater Although our management systems are designed to maintain compliance we cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with such laws regulations and permits If we violate or fail to comply with any of them a range of consequences could result including fines suspension of production alteration of manufacturing processes importexport restrictions sales limitations criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions We could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of exposure to hazardous materials used stored released disposed of by us or located at under or emanating from our facilities or other environmental or natural resource damage While we have budgeted for foreseeable associated expenditures we cannot assure you that future environmental legal requirements will not become more stringent or costly in the future Therefore we cannot assure you that our costs of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety laws and our liabilities arising from past and future releases of or exposure to hazardous substances will not have a material adverse effect on us Environmental laws are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time For example the European Union EU and China are two among a growing number of jurisdictions that have enacted restrictions on the use of lead and other materials in electronic products These regulations affect semiconductor devices and packaging As regulations restricting materials in electronic products continue to increase around the world there is a risk that the cost quality and manufacturing yields of products that are subject to these restrictions may be less favorable compared to products that are not subject to such restrictions or that the transition to compliant products may not meet customer roadmaps or produce sudden changes in demand which may result in excess inventory A number of jurisdictions including the EU Australia and China are developing or have finalized market entry or public procurement regulations for computers and servers based on ENERGY STAR specifications as well as additional energy consumption limits There is the potential for certain of our products being excluded from some of these markets which could materially adversely affect us Certain environmental laws including the US Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 or the Superfund Act impose strict or under certain circumstances joint and several liability on current and previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances and impose liability for damages to natural resources These laws often impose liability even if the owner or operator did not know of or was not responsible for the release of such hazardous substances These environmental laws also assess liability on persons who arrange for hazardous substances to be sent to disposal or treatment facilities when such facilities are found to be contaminated Such persons can be responsible for cleanup costs even if they never owned or operated the contaminated facility We have been named as a responsible party at three Superfund sites in Sunnyvale California Although we have not yet been we could be named a potentially responsible party at other Superfund or contaminated sites in the future In addition contamination that has not yet been identified could exist at our other facilities Under the DoddFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC adopted disclosure and reporting requirements for companies that use conflict minerals originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo or adjoining countries We continue to incur additional costs associated with complying with these requirements such as costs related to developing internal controls for the due diligence process determining the source of any conflict minerals used in our products auditing the process and reporting to our customers and the SEC Also since our supply chain is complex we may face reputational challenges if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of the subject minerals Moreover we are likely to encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products are certified as conflict free If we cannot satisfy these customers they may choose a competitors products 12 ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face If any of the following risks actually occurs our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected In addition you should consider the interrelationship and compounding effects of two or more risks occurring simultaneously Intel Corporations dominance of the microprocessor market and its aggressive business practices may limit our ability to compete effectively Intel Corporation has been the market share leader for microprocessors for many years Intels market share margins and significant financial resources enable it to market its products aggressively to target our customers and our channel partners with special incentives and to influence customers who do business with us These aggressive activities have in the past and are likely in the future to result in lower unit sales and a lower average selling price for many of our products and adversely affect our margins and profitability Intel exerts substantial influence over computer manufacturers and their channels of distribution through various brand and other marketing programs As a result of Intels position in the microprocessor market Intel has been able to control x86 microprocessor and computer system standards and benchmarks and to dictate the type of products the microprocessor market requires of us Intel also dominates the computer system platform which includes core logic chipsets graphics chips motherboards and other components necessary to assemble a computer system OEMs that purchase microprocessors for computer systems are highly dependent on Intel less innovative on their own and to a large extent are distributors of Intel technology Additionally Intel is able to drive de facto standards and specifications for x86 microprocessors that could cause us and other companies to have delayed access to such standards As long as Intel remains in this dominant position we may be materially adversely affected by Intels  business practices including rebating and allocation strategies and pricing actions designed to limit our market share and margins  product mix and introduction schedules  product bundling marketing and merchandising strategies  exclusivity payments to its current and potential customers and channel partners  de facto control over industry standards and heavy influence on PC manufacturers and other PC industry participants including motherboard memory chipset and basic inputoutput system or BIOS suppliers and software companies as well as the graphics interface for Intel platforms and  marketing and advertising expenditures in support of positioning the Intel brand over the brand of its original equipment manufacturer OEM customers Intel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on marketing and research and development than we do We expect Intel to maintain its market position and to continue to invest heavily in marketing research and development new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies To the extent Intel manufactures a significantly larger portion of its microprocessor products using more advanced process technologies or introduces competitive new products into the market before we do we may be more vulnerable to Intels aggressive marketing and pricing strategies for microprocessor products For example Intel has introduced microprocessors for lowcost notebooks similar to products that we offer for lowcost notebooks Intel could also take actions that place our discrete GPUs at a competitive disadvantage including giving one or more of our competitors in the graphics market such as Nvidia Corporation preferential access to its proprietary graphics interface or other useful information Intels position in the microprocessor market and integrated graphics chipset market its introduction of competitive new products its existing relationships with toptier OEMs and its aggressive marketing and pricing strategies could result in lower unit sales and a lower average selling price for our products which could have a material adverse effect on us We have a wafer supply agreement with GF with obligations to purchase all of our microprocessor and APU product requirements and a certain portion of our GPU product requirements from GF with limited exceptions If GF is not able to satisfy our manufacturing requirements our business could be adversely impacted The WSA governs the terms by which we purchase products manufactured by GF The WSA is in place until 2024 Pursuant to the WSA we are required to purchase all of our microprocessor and APU product requirements and a portion of our GPU product requirements from GF with limited exceptions If GF is unable to achieve anticipated manufacturing yields remain 13 competitive using or implementing advanced leadingedge process technologies needed to manufacture future generations of our products manufacture our products on a timely basis at competitive prices or meet our capacity requirements then we may experience delays in product launches supply shortages for certain products or increased costs and our business could be materially adversely affected Moreover if GF is unable to satisfy our manufacturing requirements and we are unable to secure from GF additional exceptions allowing us to contract with another wafer foundry to satisfy those requirements then our business could be materially adversely affected In August 2016 we entered into the sixth amendment to the WSA Sixth Amendment pursuant to which we agreed to certain annual wafer purchase targets through 2020 and if we fail to meet the agreed wafer purchase target during a calendar year we will be required to pay to GF a portion of the difference between our actual wafer purchases and the applicable annual purchase target If our actual wafer requirements are less than the number of wafers required to meet the applicable annual wafer purchase target we could have excess inventory or higher inventory unit costs both of which may adversely impact our gross margin and our results of operations In addition GF has relied on Mubadala Technology Investments LLC Mubadala Tech for its funding needs If Mubadala Tech fails to adequately fund GF on a timely basis or at all GFs ability to manufacture products for us could be materially adversely affected We rely on third parties to manufacture our products and if they are unable to do so on a timely basis in sufficient quantities and using competitive technologies our business could be materially adversely affected We rely on thirdparty wafer foundries to fabricate the silicon wafers for all of our products We also rely on thirdparty manufacturers to assemble test mark and pack ATMP our products It is important to have reliable relationships with all of these thirdparty manufacturing suppliers to ensure adequate product supply to respond to customer demand We cannot guarantee that these manufacturers or our other thirdparty manufacturing suppliers will be able to meet our nearterm or longterm manufacturing requirements If we experience supply constraints from our thirdparty manufacturing suppliers we may be required to allocate the affected products amongst our customers which could have a material adverse effect on our relationships with these customers and on our financial condition In addition if we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from our manufacturing suppliers it could result in lost sales and have a material adverse effect on our business We do not have longterm commitment contracts with some of our thirdparty manufacturing suppliers We obtain some of these manufacturing services on a purchase order basis and these manufacturers are not required to provide us with any specified minimum quantity of product beyond the quantities in an existing purchase order Accordingly we depend on these suppliers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis and at acceptable prices The manufacturers we use also fabricate wafers and assemble test and package products for other companies including certain of our competitors They could choose to prioritize capacity for other customers increase the prices that they charge us on short notice or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us which could have a material adverse effect on our business Other risks associated with our dependence on thirdparty manufacturers include limited control over delivery schedules and quality assurance lack of capacity in periods of excess demand misappropriation of our intellectual property dependence on several small undercapitalized subcontractors and limited ability to manage inventory and parts Moreover if any of our thirdparty manufacturers suffer any damage to facilities lose benefits under material agreements experience power outages lack sufficient capacity to manufacture our products encounter financial difficulties are unable to secure necessary raw materials from their suppliers or suffer any other disruption or reduction in efficiency we may encounter supply delays or disruptions If we are unable to secure sufficient or reliable supplies of products our ability to meet customer demand may be adversely affected and this could materially affect our business If we transition the production of some of our products to new manufacturers we may experience delayed product introductions lower yields or poorer performance of our products If we experience problems with product quality or are unable to secure sufficient capacity from a particular thirdparty manufacturer or if we for other reasons cease utilizing one of those suppliers we may be unable to secure an alternative supply for any specific product in a short time frame We could experience significant delays in the shipment of our products if we are required to find alternative thirdparty manufacturers which could have a material adverse effect on our business In April 2016 we consummated a transaction with Tongfu Fujitsu Microelectronics Co Ltd formerly Nantong Fujitsu Microelectronics Co Ltd TFME under which we sold to TFME 85 of the equity interests in our ATMP facilities consisting 14 of Suzhou TFAMD Semiconductor Co Ltd formerly AMD Technologies China Co Ltd and TFAMD Microelectronics Penang Sdn Bhd formerly Advanced Micro Devices Export Sdn Bhd thereby forming two joint ventures collectively the JVs The majority of our ATMP services will be provided by the JVs and there is no guarantee that the JVs will be able to adequately fulfill our ATMP requirements as we continue to transition operations to the JVs nor is there any guarantee that the JVs will be able to fulfill our longterm ATMP requirements If we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from the JVs it could result in lost sales and have a material adverse effect on our business Failure to achieve expected manufacturing yields for our products could negatively impact our financial results Semiconductor manufacturing yields are a result of both product design and process technology which is typically proprietary to the manufacturer and low yields can result from design failures process technology failures or a combination of both Our thirdparty foundries including GF are responsible for the process technologies used to fabricate silicon wafers If our thirdparty foundries experience manufacturing inefficiencies or encounter disruptions errors or difficulties during production we may fail to achieve acceptable yields or experience product delivery delays We cannot be certain that our thirdparty foundries will be able to develop obtain or successfully implement leadingedge process technologies needed to manufacture future generations of our products profitably or on a timely basis or that our competitors will not develop new technologies products or processes earlier Moreover during periods when foundries are implementing new process technologies their manufacturing facilities may not be fully productive A substantial delay in the technology transitions to smaller process technologies could have a material adverse effect on us particularly if our competitors transition to more cost effective technologies before us Any decrease in manufacturing yields could result in an increase in per unit costs which would adversely impact our gross margin andor force us to allocate our reduced product supply amongst our customers which could harm our relationships and reputation with our customers and materially adversely affect our business The success of our business is dependent upon our ability to introduce products on a timely basis with features and performance levels that provide value to our customers while supporting and coinciding with significant industry transitions Our success depends to a significant extent on the development qualification implementation and acceptance of new product designs and improvements that provide value to our customers Our ability to develop qualify and distribute and have manufactured new products and related technologies to meet evolving industry requirements at prices acceptable to our customers and on a timely basis are significant factors in determining our competitiveness in our target markets For example a large portion of our Computing and Graphics revenue is focused on consumer desktop PC and notebook While overall growth in Computing and Graphics is stabilizing the areas within Computing and Graphics are changing Our ability to take advantage of the opportunities within the areas of Computing and Graphics is based on foreseeing those changes and making timely investments in the form factors that serve those areas As consumers adopt new form factors have new product feature preferences or have different requirements than those consumers in the PC market PC sales could be negatively impacted which could adversely impact our business Our product roadmap includes a new x86 processor core codenamed Zen to help drive our reentry into highperformance and server computing We cannot assure you that our efforts to execute our product roadmap and address markets beyond our core PC market will result in innovative products and technologies that provide value to our customers If we fail to or are delayed in developing qualifying or shipping new products or technologies that provide value to our customers and address these new trends or if we fail to predict which new form factors consumers will adopt and adjust our business accordingly we may lose competitive positioning which could cause us to lose market share and require us to discount the selling prices of our products Although we make substantial investments in research and development we cannot be certain that we will be able to develop obtain or successfully implement new products and technologies on a timely basis or that they will be wellreceived by our customers Moreover our investments in new products and technologies involve certain risks and uncertainties and could disrupt our ongoing business New investments may not generate sufficient revenue may incur unanticipated liabilities and may divert our limited resources and distract management from our current operations We cannot be certain that our ongoing investments in new products and technologies will be successful will meet our expectations and will not adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating results Delays in developing qualifying or shipping new products can also cause us to miss our customers product design windows or in some cases breach contractual obligations or cause us to pay penalties If our customers do not include our products in the initial design of their computer systems or products they will typically not use our products in their systems or products until at least the next design configuration The process of being qualified for inclusion in a customers system or product can be lengthy and could cause us to further miss a cycle in the demand of endusers which also could result in a loss of market share and harm our business In addition market demand requires that products incorporate new features and performance standards on an industrywide basis Over the life of a specific product the sale price is typically reduced over time The introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products is necessary to maintain the overall corporate average selling price If we are unable to introduce new products with sufficiently high sale prices or to increase unit sales volumes capable of offsetting the reductions in the sale prices of existing products over time our business could be materially adversely affected 15 If we cannot generate sufficient revenue and operating cash flow or obtain external financing we may face a cash shortfall and be unable to make all of our planned investments in research and development or other strategic investments Our ability to fund research and development expenditures depends on generating sufficient revenue and cash flow from operations and the availability of external financing if necessary Our research and development expenditures together with ongoing operating expenses will be a substantial drain on our cash flow and may decrease our cash balances If new competitors technological advances by existing competitors or other competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in our research and development efforts our operating expenses would increase If we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without an increase in revenue our operating results could decline We regularly assess markets for external financing opportunities including debt and equity financing Additional debt or equity financing may not be available when needed or if available may not be available on satisfactory terms The health of the credit markets may adversely impact our ability to obtain financing when needed Any downgrades from credit rating agencies such as Moodys or Standard  Poors may adversely impact our ability to obtain external financing or the terms of such financing Credit agency downgrades or concerns regarding our credit worthiness may impact relationships with our suppliers who may limit our credit lines Our inability to obtain needed financing or to generate sufficient cash from operations may require us to abandon projects or curtail planned investments in research and development or other strategic initiatives If we curtail planned investments in research and development or abandon projects our products may fail to remain competitive and our business would be materially adversely affected The loss of a significant customer may have a material adverse effect on us Collectively Sony Corporation Microsoft Corporation and HP Inc accounted for approximately 59 of our consolidated net revenue for the year ended December 31 2016 Sales to Sony and Microsoft consisted of products from our Enterprise Embedded and SemiCustom segment and sales to HP Inc consisted primarily of products from our Computing and Graphics segment We expect that a small number of customers will continue to account for a substantial part of revenue of our businesses in the future If one of our key customers decides to stop buying our products or if one of these customers materially reduces or reorganizes its operations or its demand for our products our business would be materially adversely affected Our receipt of revenue from our semicustom SoC products is dependent upon our technology being designed into thirdparty products and the success of those products The revenue that we receive from our semicustom SoC products is in the form of nonrecurring engineering fees charged to third parties for design and development services and revenue received in connection with sales of our semicustom SoC products to these third parties As a result our ability to generate revenue from our semicustom products depends on our ability to secure customers for our semicustom design pipeline our customers desire to pursue the project and our semicustom SoC products being incorporated into those customers products Any revenue from sales of our semicustom SoC products is directly related to sales of the thirdpartys products and reflective of their success in the market Moreover we have no control over the marketing efforts of these third parties and we cannot make any assurances that sales of their products will be successful in current or future years Consequently the semicustom SoC product revenue expected by us may not be fully realized and our operating results may be adversely affected Global economic uncertainty may adversely impact our business and operating results Uncertain global economic conditions have in the past and may in the future adversely impact our business including without limitation a slowdown in the Chinese economy one of the largest global markets for desktop and notebook PCs Uncertainty in the worldwide economic environment may negatively impact consumer confidence and spending causing our customers to postpone purchases In addition during challenging economic times our current or potential future customers may experience cash flow problems and as a result may modify delay or cancel plans to purchase our products Additionally if our customers are not successful in generating sufficient revenue or are unable to secure financing they may not be able to pay or may delay payment of accounts receivable that they owe us The risk related to our customers potentially defaulting on or delaying payments to us is increased because we expect that a small number of customers will continue to account for a substantial part of our revenue Any inability of our current or potential future customers to pay us for our products may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow Moreover our key suppliers may reduce their output or become insolvent thereby adversely impacting our ability to manufacture our products In addition uncertain economic conditions may make it more difficult for us to raise funds through borrowings or private or public sales of debt or equity securities 16 The markets in which our products are sold are highly competitive The markets in which our products are sold are very competitive and delivering the latest and best products to market on a timely basis is critical to achieving revenue growth We believe that the main factors that determine our product competitiveness are timely product introductions product quality product features and capabilities including enabling stateoftheart visual and virtual reality experience energy efficiency including power consumption and battery life reliability processor clock speed performance size or form factor selling price cost adherence to industry standards and the creation of open industry standards level of integration software and hardware compatibility security and stability brand recognition and availability We expect that competition will continue to be intense due to rapid technological changes frequent product introductions by our competitors or new competitors of products that may provide better performanceexperience or may include additional features that render our products uncompetitive We may also face aggressive pricing by competitors especially during challenging economic times Some competitors may have greater access or rights to complementary technologies including interface processor and memory technical information For instance with the introduction of our APU products and other competing solutions with integrated graphics we believe that demand for additional discrete graphics chips and cards may decrease in the future due to improvements in the quality and performance of integrated graphics In addition our competitors have significant marketing and sales resources which could increase the competitive environment in such a declining market leading to lower prices and margins If competitors introduce competitive new products into the market before us demand for our products could be adversely impacted and our business could be adversely affected In addition we are entering markets with current and new competitors who may be able to adapt more quickly to customer requirements and emerging technologies We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current or new competitors who may have stronger positions in these new markets or superior ability to anticipate customer requirements and emerging industry trends We may face delays or disruptions in research and development efforts or we may be required to invest significantly greater resources in research and development than anticipated We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt obligations or meet our working capital requirements Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt will depend on our financial and operating performance which may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial business and other factors many of which are beyond our control We cannot assure you that we will be able to generate cash flow or that we will be able to borrow funds including under our secured revolving line of credit for a principal amount up to 500 million our Secured Revolving Line of Credit in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our debt or to meet our working capital requirements If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to borrow sufficient funds to service our debt we may be required to sell assets or equity reduce expenditures refinance all or a portion of our existing debt or obtain additional financing We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance our debt sell assets or equity borrow funds under our Secured Revolving Line of Credit or borrow more funds on terms acceptable to us if at all We have a substantial amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from implementing our strategy or fulfilling our contractual obligations Our total debt as of December 31 2016 was 14 billion net of unamortized debt issuance costs and unamortized debt discount associated with the 2125 Notes Our substantial indebtedness may  make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations including making scheduled principal and interest payments  limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes  limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital capital expenditures acquisitions or other general corporate purposes  require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with relatively less debt and  increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions We enter into interest rate swap agreements from time to time to manage our exposure to interest rate risk These swap agreements involve risks such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements the risk that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to changes in interest rates and the risk that our exposure to interest rates may increase if interest rates increase 17 We also enter into sale and factoring arrangements from time to time with respect to certain of our accounts receivables which arrangements are nonrecourse to us in the event that an account debtor fails to pay for creditrelated reasons and are not included in our indebtedness We could become obligated to repurchase such accounts receivables or otherwise incur liability to the counterparties under these arrangements under certain circumstances such as where a commercial dispute arises between us and an account debtor The agreements governing our notes and our Secured Revolving Line of Credit impose restrictions on us that may adversely affect our ability to operate our business The indentures governing our 675 Senior Notes due 2019 675 Notes 750 Senior Notes due 2022 750 Notes 700 Senior Notes due 2024 700 Notes and 2125 Notes contain various covenants which limit our ability to among other things  incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends and make other restricted payments  make certain investments including investments in our unrestricted subsidiaries  create or permit certain liens  create or permit restrictions on the ability of certain restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to us  use the proceeds from sales of assets  enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates and  consolidate or merge or sell our assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety In addition the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement restricts our ability to make cash payments on the notes to the extent that on the date of such payment a default or event of default exists under the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement or we have not had at all times during the 45 consecutive days immediately preceding such payment or would not have on a pro forma basis after giving effect to such payment Excess Cash Availability as defined in the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement of at least 100 million Any of our future debt agreements may contain similar restrictions If we fail to make any cash payment on a series of notes when required by the applicable indenture it would constitute an event of default under such indenture which in turn would constitute an event of default under the agreements governing our other indebtedness Our Secured Revolving Line of Credit also contains various covenants which limit our ability to among other things make certain investments merge or consolidate with other entities and permit certain subsidiaries from incurring indebtedness In addition further restrictions apply when certain payment conditions the Payment Conditions are not satisfied with respect to specified transactions events or payments The Payment Conditions include that i no default or event of default exists and ii at all times during the 45 consecutive days immediately prior to such transaction event or payment and on a pro forma basis after giving effect to such transaction event or payment and any incurrence or repayment of indebtedness in connection therewith the Loan Parties Excess Cash Availability as defined in the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement available cash is greater than the greater of 20 of the total commitment amount and 100 million If Payment Conditions are not satisfied under certain circumstances we will become subject to various additional covenants which limit our ability to among other things  create liens upon any of the Loan Parties property other than customary permitted liens and liens in respect of up to 15 billion of secured credit facilities debt which amount includes our Secured Revolving Line of Credit  declare or make cash distributions  create any encumbrance on the ability of a subsidiary to make any upstream payments  make asset dispositions other than certain ordinary course dispositions and certain supply chain finance arrangements  make certain loans make payments with respect to subordinated debt or certain borrowed money prior to its due date and  enter into any nonarmslength transaction with an affiliate except for certain customary exceptions The agreements governing our notes and our Secured Revolving Line of Credit contain crossdefault provisions whereby a default under one agreement would likely result in cross defaults under agreements covering other borrowings For example the occurrence of a default with respect to any indebtedness or any failure to repay debt when due in an amount in excess of 50 million would cause a cross default under the indentures to the extent such default would result in the acceleration of such indebtedness governing our 675 Notes 750 Notes 700 Notes and 2125 Notes as well as under our Secured Revolving Line of Credit The occurrence of a default under any of these borrowing arrangements would permit the applicable note holders or the lenders under our Secured Revolving Line of Credit to declare all amounts outstanding under those borrowing arrangements to be immediately due and payable If the note holders or the trustee under the indentures governing our 675 Notes 750 18 Notes 700 Notes or 2125 Notes or the lenders under our Secured Revolving Line of Credit accelerate the repayment of borrowings we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay those borrowings Uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of our products could materially adversely affect us We typically sell our products pursuant to individual purchase orders We generally do not have longterm supply arrangements with our customers or minimum purchase requirements except that orders generally must be for standard pack quantities Generally our customers may cancel orders for standard products more than 30 days prior to shipment without incurring significant fees We base our inventory levels in part on customers estimates of demand for their products which may not accurately predict the quantity or type of our products that our customers will want in the future or ultimately end up purchasing Our ability to forecast demand is even further complicated when our products are sold indirectly through downstream channel distributors and customers as our forecasts for demand are then based on estimates provided by multiple parties throughout the downstream channel PC and consumer markets are characterized by short product lifecycles which can lead to rapid obsolescence and price erosion In addition our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason We may build inventories during periods of anticipated growth and the cancellation or deferral of product orders or overproduction due to failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess or obsolete inventory which could result in writedowns of inventory and an adverse effect on gross margins Factors that may result in excess or obsolete inventory which could result in writedowns of the value of our inventory a reduction in the average selling price or a reduction in our gross margin include  a sudden or significant decrease in demand for our products  a production or design defect in our products  a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements  a failure to accurately estimate customer demand for our products including for our older products as our new products are introduced or  our competitors introducing new products or taking aggressive pricing actions The demand for our products depends in part on the market conditions in the industries into which they are sold Fluctuations in demand for our products or a market decline in any of these industries could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations Industrywide fluctuations in the computer marketplace have materially adversely affected us in the past and may materially adversely affect us in the future A large portion of our Computing and Graphics revenue is focused on the consumer desktop PC and notebook segments which have experienced and continue to experience a decline driven by among other factors the adoption of smaller and other form factors increased competition and changes in replacement cycles The success of our semicustom SoC products is dependent on securing customers for our semicustom design pipeline and consumer market conditions including the success of the new Sony PlayStation4 and Microsoft Xbox One game console systems worldwide Our ability to design and introduce new products in a timely manner is dependent upon thirdparty intellectual property In the design and development of new and enhanced products we rely on thirdparty intellectual property such as software development tools and hardware testing tools Furthermore certain product features may rely on intellectual property acquired from third parties The design requirements necessary to meet customer demand for more features and greater functionality from semiconductor products may exceed the capabilities of the thirdparty intellectual property or development tools available to us If the thirdparty intellectual property that we use becomes unavailable is not available with required functionality and performance in the time frame or price point needed for our new products or fails to produce designs that meet customer demands our business could be materially adversely affected We depend on thirdparty companies for the design manufacture and supply of motherboards software and other computer platform components to support our business We depend on thirdparty companies for the design manufacture and supply of motherboards software eg BIOS operating systems and other components that our customers utilize to support our microprocessor GPU and APU offerings We also rely on AIBs to support our GPU and APU products In addition our microprocessors are not designed to function with motherboards and chipsets designed to work with Intel microprocessors If the designers manufacturers AIBs and suppliers of motherboards 19 software and other components decrease their support for our product offerings our business could be materially adversely affected If we lose Microsoft Corporations support for our products or other software vendors do not design and develop software to run on our products our ability to sell our products could be materially adversely affected Our ability to innovate beyond the x86 instruction set controlled by Intel depends partially on Microsoft designing and developing its operating systems to run on or support our x86based microprocessor products With respect to our graphics products we depend in part on Microsoft to design and develop its operating system to run on or support our graphics products Similarly the success of our products in the market such as our APU products is dependent on independent software providers designing and developing software to run on our products If Microsoft does not continue to design and develop its operating systems so that they work with our x86 instruction sets or does not continue to develop and maintain their operating systems to support our graphics products independent software providers may forego designing their software applications to take advantage of our innovations and customers may not purchase PCs with our products In addition some software drivers sold with our products are certified by Microsoft If Microsoft did not certify a driver or if we otherwise fail to retain the support of Microsoft or other software vendors our ability to market our products would be materially adversely affected Our reliance on thirdparty distributors and AIB partners subjects us to certain risks We market and sell our products directly and through thirdparty distributors and AIB partners pursuant to agreements that can generally be terminated for convenience by either party upon prior notice to the other party These agreements are nonexclusive and permit both our distributors and AIBs to offer our competitors products We are dependent on our distributors and AIBs to supplement our direct marketing and sales efforts If any significant distributor or AIB or a substantial number of our distributors or AIBs terminated their relationship with us decided to market our competitors products over our products or decided not to market our products at all our ability to bring our products to market would be impacted and we would be materially adversely affected If we are unable to manage the risks related to the use of our thirdparty distributors and AIB partners or offer appropriate incentives to focus them on the sale of our products our business could be materially adversely affected Additionally distributors and AIBs typically maintain an inventory of our products In most instances our agreements with distributors protect their inventory of our products against price reductions as well as provide return rights for any product that we have removed from our price book and that is not more than 12 months older than the manufacturing code date Some agreements with our distributors also contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns Our agreements with AIBs protect their inventory of our products against price reductions We defer the gross margins on our sales to distributors and AIBs resulting from both our deferral of revenue and related product costs until the applicable products are resold by the distributors or the AIBs However in the event of a significant decline in the price of our products the price protection rights we offer would materially adversely affect us because our revenue and corresponding gross margin would decline Our inability to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel may hinder our business Much of our future success depends upon the continued service of numerous qualified engineering marketing sales and executive personnel Competition for highly skilled employees and executives in the technology industry is intense If we are not able to continue to attract train and retain qualified personnel necessary for our business the progress of our product development programs could be hindered and we could be materially adversely affected To help attract retain and motivate qualified personnel we use sharebased incentive awards such as employee stock options and nonvested share units restricted stock units If the value of such stock awards does not appreciate as measured by the performance of the price of our common stock or if our sharebased compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit our ability to attract retain and motivate personnel could be weakened which could harm our results of operations Also if the value of our stock awards increases substantially this could potentially create great personal wealth for our employees and affect our ability to retain these employees In addition our current and any future restructuring plans may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain key employees Our issuance to West Coast Hitech LP WCH of warrants to purchase 75 million shares of our common stock if and when exercised will dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders and the conversion of the 2125 Notes may dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholders or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock In consideration for the limited waiver and rights under the Sixth Amendment we issued warrants to WCH to purchase 75 million shares of our common stock Any issuance by us of common shares to WCH upon exercise of the warrants will dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders Any sales in the public market by WCH of any shares owned by WCH could 20 adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock and the anticipated exercise by WCH of the warrants could depress the price of our common stock Also the conversion of some or all of the 2125 Notes may dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders Such 2125 Notes may become convertible at the option of their holders prior to their scheduled term under certain circumstances Any sales in the public market of our common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock In addition the existence of the 2125 Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion thereof could be used to satisfy short positions or the anticipated conversion of the 2125 Notes into cash andor shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock In the event of a change of control we may not be able to repurchase our outstanding debt as required by the applicable indentures and our Secured Revolving Line of Credit which would result in a default under the indentures and our Secured Revolving Line of Credit Upon a change of control we will be required to offer to repurchase all of our 675 Notes 750 Notes 700 Notes and 2125 Notes then outstanding at 101 of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest if any up to but excluding the repurchase date In addition a change of control would be an event of default under our Secured Revolving Line of Credit As of December 31 2016 no borrowings were outstanding under the Secured Revolving Line of Credit 19 million related to letters of credit under the Secured Revolving Line of Credit remained outstanding and 143 billion was outstanding under our notes Future debt agreements may contain similar provisions We may not have the financial resources to repurchase our outstanding notes and prepay all of our outstanding obligations under our Secured Revolving Line of Credit The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has experienced severe downturns that have materially adversely affected and may continue to materially adversely affect our business in the future The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has experienced significant downturns often in conjunction with constant and rapid technological change wide fluctuations in supply and demand continuous new product introductions price erosion and declines in general economic conditions We have incurred substantial losses in recent downturns due to  substantial declines in average selling prices  the cyclical nature of supply and demand imbalances in the semiconductor industry  a decline in demand for enduser products such as PCs that incorporate our products and  excess inventory levels Industrywide fluctuations in the computer marketplace have materially adversely affected us in the past and may materially adversely affect us in the future For example a large portion of our Computing and Graphics revenue is focused on consumer desktop PC and notebook segments While the overall growth in these segments is stabilizing the subsegments of these markets are changing Our ability to take advantage of the growth in these subsegments is based on foreseeing those changes and making timely investments in the form factors that serve those growing subsegments Global economic uncertainty and weakness have also impacted the semiconductor market as consumers and businesses have deferred purchases which negatively impacted demand for our products Our financial performance has been and may in the future be negatively affected by these downturns The growth of our business is also dependent on continued demand for our products from highgrowth adjacent emerging global markets Our ability to be successful in such markets depends in part on our ability to establish adequate local infrastructure as well as our ability to cultivate and maintain local relationships in these markets If demand from these markets is below our expectations sales of our products may decrease which would have a material adverse effect on us Acquisitions divestitures andor joint ventures could disrupt our business harm our financial condition and operating results or dilute or adversely affect the price of our common stock Our success will depend in part on our ability to expand our product offerings and grow our business in response to changing technologies customer demands and competitive pressures In some circumstances we may pursue growth through the acquisition of complementary businesses solutions or technologies or through divestitures or joint ventures rather than through internal development The identification of suitable acquisition or joint venture candidates can be difficult timeconsuming and costly and we may not be able to successfully complete identified acquisitions or joint ventures Moreover if such acquisitions or joint ventures require us to seek additional debt or equity financing we may not be able to obtain such financing on terms favorable to us or at all Even if we successfully complete an acquisition or a joint venture we may not be able to assimilate and 21 integrate effectively or efficiently the acquired business technologies solutions assets personnel or operations particularly if key personnel of the acquired company decide not to work for us Acquisitions and joint ventures may also involve the entry into geographic or business markets in which we have little or no prior experience Consequently we may not achieve anticipated benefits of the acquisitions or joint ventures which could harm our operating results In addition to complete an acquisition we may issue equity securities which would dilute our stockholders ownership and could adversely affect the price of our common stock as well as incur debt assume contingent liabilities or have amortization expenses and writedowns of acquired assets which could adversely affect our results of operations Acquisitions and joint ventures may also reduce our cash available for operations and other uses which could harm our business Also any failure on our part to effectively evaluate and execute new business initiatives could adversely affect our business We may not adequately assess the risk of new business initiatives and subsequent events may arise that alter the risks that were initially considered Furthermore we may not achieve the objectives and expectations with respect to future operations products and services On April 2016 we consummated the transaction with TFME under which we sold to TFME 85 of the equity interests in our JVs Going forward we expect the majority of our ATMP services will be provided by the JVs and there is no guarantee that the JVs will be able to adequately fulfill our ATMP requirements as we continue to transition operations to TFME nor is there any guarantee that the JVs will be able to fulfill our longterm ATMP requirements If we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from the JVs it could result in lost sales and have a material adverse effect on our business In addition we may not realize the anticipated benefits from any new business initiatives For example in connection with our strategy of licensing portions of our intellectual property portfolio in the first quarter of 2016 we entered into a joint venture with Tianjin Haiguang Advanced Technology Investment Co Ltd THATIC comprised of two separate legal entities China JV1 and China JV2 collectively the THATIC JV The primary purpose of the THATIC JV is to support our expansion into the server and workstation product market in China We also licensed certain of our intellectual property Licensed IP to the THATIC JV for license fees payable over several years contingent upon achievement of certain milestones We also expect to receive a royalty based on the sales of the THATIC JVs products to be developed on the basis of such Licensed IP We may not realize the expected benefits from this joint venture including the THATIC JVs expected future performance the receipt of any future milestone payments from the Licensed IP and the receipt of any royalty payments from future sales of products by the THATIC JV Our business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our internal business processes and information systems and modification or interruption of such systems may disrupt our business processes and internal controls We rely upon a number of internal business processes and information systems to support key business functions and the efficient operation of these processes and systems is critical to our business Our business processes and information systems need to be sufficiently scalable to support the growth of our business and may require modifications or upgrades that expose us to a number of operational risks As such our information systems will continually evolve and adapt in order to meet our business needs These changes may be costly and disruptive to our operations and could impose substantial demands on management time These changes may also require changes in our information systems modification of internal control procedures and significant training of employees and thirdparty resources We continuously work on simplifying our information systems and applications through consolidation and standardization efforts There can be no assurance that our business and operations will not experience any disruption in connection with this transition Our information technology systems and those of thirdparty information technology providers or business partners may also be vulnerable to damage or disruption caused by circumstances beyond our control including catastrophic events power anomalies or outages natural disasters viruses or malware cyberattacks data breaches and computer system or network failures exposing us to significant cost reputational harm and disruption or damage to our business In addition as our IT environment continues to evolve we are embracing new ways of communicating and sharing data internally and externally with customers and partners using methods such as mobility and the cloud that can promote business efficiency However these practices can also result in a more distributed IT environment making it more difficult for us to maintain visibility and control over internal and external users and meet scalability and administrative requirements If our security controls cannot keep pace with the speed of these changes or if we are not able to meet regulatory and compliance requirements our business would be materially adversely affected Data breaches and cyberattacks could compromise our intellectual property or other sensitive information be costly to remediate and cause significant damage to our business and reputation In the ordinary course of our business we maintain sensitive data on our networks including our intellectual property and proprietary or confidential business information relating to our business and that of our customers and business partners The 22 secure maintenance of this information is critical to our business and reputation We believe that companies have been increasingly subject to a wide variety of security incidents cyberattacks hacking and phishing attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access These threats can come from a variety of sources all ranging in sophistication from an individual hacker to a statesponsored attack Cyber threats may be generic or they may be customcrafted against our information systems Over the past year cyberattacks have become more prevalent and much harder to detect and defend against Our network and storage applications may be subject to unauthorized access by hackers or breached due to operator error malfeasance or other system disruptions It is often difficult to anticipate or immediately detect such incidents and the damage caused by such incidents These data breaches and any unauthorized access or disclosure of our information or intellectual property could compromise our intellectual property and expose sensitive business information Cyberattacks could also cause us to incur significant remediation costs result in product development delays disrupt key business operations and divert attention of management and key information technology resources These incidents could also subject us to liability expose us to significant expense and cause significant harm to our reputation and business In addition we could be subject to potential claims for damages resulting from loss of data from alleged vulnerabilities in the security of our processors We also maintain confidential and personally identifiable information about our workers The integrity and protection of our worker data is critical to our business and our workers have a high expectation that we will adequately protect their personal information We anticipate an increase in costs related to  implementing new data security procedures including costs related to upgrading computer and network security  training workers to maintain and monitor our security measures  remediating any data security breach and addressing the related litigation and  mitigating reputational harm We often partner with thirdparty providers for certain worker services and we may provide certain limited worker information to such third parties based on the scope of the services provided to us However if these third parties fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practices or in the event of a breach of their networks our workers data may be improperly accessed used or disclosed A breach of data privacy is likely to cause significant disruption of our business operations Failure to adequately maintain and update our security systems could materially adversely affect our operations and our ability to maintain worker confidence Failure to prevent unauthorized access to electronic and other confidential information and data breaches could materially adversely affect our financial condition our competitive position and operating results Our operating results are subject to quarterly and seasonal sales patterns A large portion of our quarterly sales have historically been made in the last month of the quarter This uneven sales pattern makes prediction of revenue for each financial period difficult and increases the risk of unanticipated variations in quarterly results and financial condition In addition our operating results tend to vary seasonally with the markets in which our products are sold For example historically first quarter PC product sales are generally lower than fourth quarter sales In addition with respect to our semicustom SoC products for game consoles we expect sales patterns to follow the seasonal trends of a consumer business with sales in the first half of the year being lower than sales in the second half of the year Many of the factors that create and affect quarterly and seasonal trends are beyond our control If essential equipment materials or manufacturing processes are not available to manufacture our products we could be materially adversely affected We may purchase equipment and materials for our backend manufacturing operations from a number of suppliers and our operations depend upon obtaining deliveries of adequate supplies of equipment and materials on a timely basis Our thirdparty suppliers also depend on the same timely delivery of adequate quantities of equipment and materials in the manufacture of our products In addition as many of our products increase in technical complexity we rely on our thirdparty suppliers to update their processes in order to continue meeting our backend manufacturing needs Certain equipment and materials that are used in the manufacture of our products are available only from a limited number of suppliers or in some cases a sole supplier We also depend on a limited number of suppliers to provide the majority of certain types of integrated circuit packages for our microprocessors including our APU products Similarly certain nonproprietary materials or components such as memory printed circuit boards PCBs interposers substrates and capacitors used in the manufacture of our products are currently available from only a limited number of sources Because some of the equipment and materials that we and our thirdparty manufacturing suppliers purchase are complex it is sometimes difficult to substitute one supplier for another From time to time suppliers may extend lead times limit supply or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors Also some of these materials and components may be subject to rapid changes in price and availability Interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry could cause shortages and price increases in various essential materials Dependence on a sole supplier or a limited number of suppliers exacerbates these risks If we are unable to procure certain of these materials 23 for our backend manufacturing operations or our thirdparty foundries or manufacturing suppliers are unable to procure materials for manufacturing our products our business would be materially adversely affected If our products are not compatible with some or all industrystandard software and hardware we could be materially adversely affected Our products may not be fully compatible with some or all industrystandard software and hardware Further we may be unsuccessful in correcting any such compatibility problems in a timely manner If our customers are unable to achieve compatibility with software or hardware we could be materially adversely affected In addition the mere announcement of an incompatibility problem relating to our products could have a material adverse effect on our business Costs related to defective products could have a material adverse effect on us Products as complex as those we offer may contain defects or failures when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements to existing products are released We cannot assure you that despite our testing procedures errors will not be found in new products or releases after commencement of commercial shipments in the future which could result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products material recall and replacement costs delay in recognition or loss of revenue writing down the inventory of defective products the diversion of the attention of our engineering personnel from product development efforts defending against litigation related to defective products or related property damage or personal injury and damage to our reputation in the industry and could adversely affect our relationships with our customers In addition we may have difficulty identifying the end customers of the defective products in the field As a result we could incur substantial costs to implement modifications to correct defects Any of these problems could materially adversely affect our business We could be subject to potential product liability claims if one of our products causes or merely appears to have caused an injury Claims may be made by consumers or others selling our products and we may be subject to claims against us even if an alleged injury is due to the actions of others A product liability claim recall or other claim with respect to uninsured liabilities or for amounts in excess of insured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business If we fail to maintain the efficiency of our supply chain as we respond to changes in customer demand for our products our business could be materially adversely affected Our ability to meet customer demand for our products depends in part on our ability to deliver the products our customers want on a timely basis Accordingly we rely on our supply chain for the manufacturing distribution and fulfillment of our products As we continue to grow our business expand to highgrowth adjacent markets acquire new customers and strengthen relationships with existing customers the efficiency of our supply chain will become increasingly important because many of our customers tend to have specific requirements for particular products and specific timeframes in which they require delivery of these products If we are unable to consistently deliver the right products to our customers on a timely basis in the right locations our customers may reduce the quantities they order from us which could have a material adverse effect on our business We outsource to third parties certain supplychain logistics functions including portions of our product distribution transportation management and information technology support services We rely on thirdparty providers to operate our regional product distribution centers and to manage the transportation of our workinprocess and finished products among our facilities to our manufacturing suppliers and to our customers In addition we rely on third parties to provide certain information technology services to us including help desk support desktop application services business and software support applications server and storage administration data center operations database administration and voice video and remote access We cannot guarantee that these providers will fulfill their respective responsibilities in a timely manner in accordance with the contract terms in which case our internal operations and the distribution of our products to our customers could be materially adversely affected Also we cannot guarantee that our contracts with these thirdparty providers will be renewed in which case we would have to transition these functions inhouse or secure new providers which could have a material adverse effect on our business if the transition is not executed appropriately The completion and impact of the 2015 Restructuring Plan our transformation initiatives and any future restructuring actions could adversely affect us In the third quarter of 2015 we implemented a restructuring plan 2015 Restructuring Plan focused on our ongoing efforts to simplify our business and better align resources around our priorities and business outlook The 2015 Restructuring Plan largely involved a reduction of global headcount by approximately 5 and includes organizational actions such as outsourcing certain IT services and application development We expect the 2015 Restructuring Plan will be completed by the end of the first quarter 24 of 2017 These restructuring actions and any future restructuring actions could have an adverse impact on our business as a result of decreases in employee morale and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees We cannot be sure that we will realize operational savings or any other anticipated benefits from the 2015 Restructuring Plan or any future restructuring actions Any operating savings are subject to assumptions estimates and significant economic competitive and other uncertainties some of which are beyond our control If these estimates and assumptions are incorrect if we experience delays or if other unforeseen events occur our business and financial results could be adversely affected Any transformation initiatives or future restructuring actions we undertake may fail to achieve the anticipated results and may materially adversely affect our business and financial results We may incur future impairments of goodwill We perform our annual goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year Subsequent to our annual goodwill impairment analysis we monitor for any events or changes in circumstances such as significant adverse changes in business climate or operating results changes in managements business strategy an inability to successfully introduce new products in the marketplace an inability to successfully achieve internal forecasts or significant declines in our stock price which may represent an indicator of impairment The occurrence of any of these events may require us to record future goodwill impairment charges Our stock price is subject to volatility Our stock price has experienced price and volume fluctuations and could be subject to wide fluctuations in the future During 2016 the closing price of our stock price ranged from 180 to 1207 The trading price of our stock may fluctuate widely due to various factors including actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial conditions and operating results changes in financial estimates by us or securities analysts changes in our capital structure including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public interest rate changes and broad market and industry fluctuations Stock price fluctuations could impact the value of our equity compensation which could affect our ability to recruit and retain employees In addition volatility in our stock price could adversely affect our business and financing opportunities Our worldwide operations are subject to political legal and economic risks and natural disasters which could have a material adverse effect on us We maintain operations around the world including in the United States Canada Europe and Asia We rely on thirdparty wafer foundries in Europe and Asia Nearly all product assembly and final testing of our products is performed at manufacturing facilities operated by thirdparty manufacturing facilities in China Malaysia and Taiwan We also have international sales operations International sales as a percent of net revenue were 78 in 2016 We expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future The political legal and economic risks associated with our operations in foreign countries include without limitation  expropriation  changes in a specific countrys or regions political or economic conditions  changes in tax laws trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements  difficulties in protecting our intellectual property  difficulties in managing staffing and exposure to different employment practices and labor laws  changes in foreign currency exchange rates  restrictions on transfers of funds and other assets of our subsidiaries between jurisdictions  changes in freight and interest rates  disruption in air transportation between the United States and our overseas facilities  loss or modification of exemptions for taxes and tariffs and  compliance with US laws and regulations related to international operations including export control and economic sanctions laws and regulations and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act In addition our worldwide operations or those of our business partners could be subject to natural disasters such as earthquakes tsunamis flooding typhoons and volcanic eruptions that disrupt manufacturing or other operations For example our Sunnyvale operations are located near major earthquake fault lines in California Any conflict or uncertainty in the countries in which we operate including public health issues for example an outbreak of a contagious disease such as Avian Influenza measles or Ebola safety issues natural disasters fire disruptions of service from utilities nuclear power plant accidents or general economic or political factors For example the United Kingdoms recent referendum commonly referred to as Brexit 25 has created economic and political uncertainty in the European Union Also the new US administration has called for changes to domestic and foreign policy We cannot predict the impact if any of the policies adopted by the new administration will have on our business Until we know what changes are enacted we will not know whether in total we benefit from or are negatively affected by the changes Any of the above risks should they occur could result in an increase in the cost of components production delays general business interruptions delays from difficulties in obtaining export licenses for certain technology tariffs and other barriers and restrictions longer payment cycles increased taxes restrictions on the repatriation of funds and the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws any of which could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business Worldwide political conditions may adversely affect demand for our products Worldwide political conditions may create uncertainties that could adversely affect our business The United States has been and may continue to be involved in armed conflicts that could have a further impact on our sales and our supply chain The consequences of armed conflict political instability or civil or military unrest are unpredictable and we may not be able to foresee events that could have a material adverse effect on us Terrorist attacks or other hostile acts may negatively affect our operations or adversely affect demand for our products and such attacks or related armed conflicts may impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers Furthermore these attacks or hostile acts may make travel and the transportation of our products more difficult and more expensive which could materially adversely affect us Any of these events could cause consumer spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the United States economy and worldwide financial markets Unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect us We have costs assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies As a consequence movements in exchange rates could cause our foreign currency denominated expenses to increase as a percentage of revenue affecting our profitability and cash flows Whenever we believe appropriate we hedge a portion of our shortterm foreign currency exposure to protect against fluctuations in currency exchange rates We determine our total foreign currency exposure using projections of longterm expenditures for items such as payroll We cannot assure you that these activities will be effective in reducing foreign exchange rate exposure Failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flow In addition the majority of our product sales are denominated in US dollars Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the US dollar and the local currency can cause increases or decreases in the cost of our products in the local currency of such customers An appreciation of the US dollar relative to the local currency could reduce sales of our products Our inability to effectively control the sales of our products on the gray market could have a material adverse effect on us We market and sell our products directly to OEMs and through authorized thirdparty distributors From time to time our products are diverted from our authorized distribution channels and are sold on the gray market Gray market products result in shadow inventory that is not visible to us thus making it difficult to forecast demand accurately Also when gray market products enter the market we and our distribution channels compete with these heavily discounted gray market products which adversely affects demand for our products and negatively impact our margins In addition our inability to control gray market activities could result in customer satisfaction issues because any time products are purchased outside our authorized distribution channels there is a risk that our customers are buying counterfeit or substandard products including products that may have been altered mishandled or damaged or are used products represented as new If we cannot adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property in the United States and abroad through patents copyrights trade secrets trademarks and other measures we may lose a competitive advantage and incur significant expenses We rely on a combination of protections provided by contracts including confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements copyrights patents trademarks and common law rights such as trade secrets to protect our intellectual property However we cannot assure you that we will be able to adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property from thirdparty infringement or from misappropriation in the United States and abroad Any patent licensed by us or issued to us could be challenged invalidated or circumvented or rights granted there under may not provide a competitive advantage to us Furthermore patent applications that we file may not result in issuance of a patent or if a patent is issued the patent may not be issued in a form that is advantageous to us Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights others may independently develop similar products duplicate our products or design around our patents and other rights In addition it is difficult to monitor compliance with and enforce our intellectual property on a worldwide basis in a costeffective manner In jurisdictions where foreign laws provide less intellectual property protection than afforded in the United States and abroad our technology or other intellectual property may be compromised and our business would be materially adversely affected 26 We are party to litigation and may become a party to other claims or litigation that could cause us to incur substantial costs or pay substantial damages or prohibit us from selling our products From time to time we are a defendant or plaintiff in various legal actions For example on January 15 2014 March 20 2014 April 27 2015 and September 29 2015 complaints were filed against us seeking damages for alleged securities law violations which are described in Note 17 of our consolidated financial statements Our products are purchased by andor used by consumers which could increase our exposure to consumer actions such as product liability claims and consumer class action claims On occasion we receive claims that individuals were allegedly exposed to substances used in our former semiconductor wafer manufacturing facilities and that this alleged exposure caused harm Litigation can involve complex factual and legal questions and its outcome is uncertain Any claim that is successfully asserted against us including the claims filed against us on January 15 2014 March 20 2014 April 27 2015 and September 29 2015 may result in the payment of damages that could be material to our business With respect to intellectual property litigation from time to time we have been notified of or third parties may bring or have brought actions against us andor against our customers based on allegations that we are infringing the intellectual property rights of others contributing to or inducing the infringement of the intellectual property rights of others improperly claiming ownership of intellectual property or otherwise improperly using the intellectual property of others If any such claims are asserted we may seek to obtain a license under the third parties intellectual property rights We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain all of the necessary licenses on satisfactory terms if at all These parties may file lawsuits against us or our customers seeking damages potentially up to and including treble damages or an injunction against the sale of products that incorporate allegedly infringed intellectual property or against the operation of our business as presently conducted which could result in our having to stop the sale of some of our products or to increase the costs of selling some of our products or which could damage our reputation The award of damages including material royalty payments or other types of damages or the entry of an injunction against the manufacture and sale of some or all of our products could have a material adverse effect on us We could decide in the alternative to redesign our products or to resort to litigation to challenge such claims Such challenges could be extremely expensive and timeconsuming regardless of their merit could cause delays in product release or shipment andor could have a material adverse effect on us We cannot assure you that litigation related to our intellectual property rights or the intellectual property rights of others can always be avoided or successfully concluded Even if we were to prevail any litigation could be costly and timeconsuming and would divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations which could have a material adverse effect on us Our business is subject to potential tax liabilities We are subject to income taxes in the United States Canada and other foreign jurisdictions Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes In the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable we cannot assure you that the final determination of any tax audits and litigation will not be materially different from that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals Should additional taxes be assessed as a result of an audit assessment or litigation there could be a material adverse effect on our cash income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made We are subject to environmental laws conflict mineralsrelated provisions of the DoddFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act as well as a variety of other laws or regulations that could result in additional costs and liabilities Our operations and properties have in the past been and continue to be subject to various United States and foreign laws and regulations including those relating to materials used in our products and manufacturing processes discharge of pollutants into the environment the treatment transport storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and remediation of contamination These laws and regulations require our suppliers to obtain permits for operations making our products including the discharge of air pollutants and wastewater Although our management systems are designed to oversee our suppliers compliance we cannot assure you that our suppliers have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with such laws regulations and permits If our suppliers violate or fail to comply with any of them a range of consequences could result including fines suspension of production alteration of manufacturing processes importexport restrictions sales limitations criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions Such noncompliance from our manufacturing suppliers could result in disruptions in supply higher sourcing costs andor reputational damage for us Environmental laws are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time For example the European Union EU and China are two among a growing number of jurisdictions that have enacted restrictions on the use of lead and other materials in electronic products These regulations affect semiconductor devices and packaging As regulations 27 restricting materials in electronic products continue to increase around the world there is a risk that the cost quality and manufacturing yields of products that are subject to these restrictions may be less favorable compared to products that are not subject to such restrictions or that the transition to compliant products may not meet customer roadmaps or produce sudden changes in demand which may result in excess inventory A number of jurisdictions including the EU Australia and China are developing or have finalized market entry or public procurement regulations for computers and servers based on ENERGY STAR specifications as well as additional energy consumption limits There is the potential for certain of our products being excluded from some of these markets which could materially adversely affect us Certain environmental laws including the US Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 or the Superfund Act impose strict or under certain circumstances joint and several liability on current and previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances and impose liability for damages to natural resources These laws often impose liability even if the owner or operator did not know of or was not responsible for the release of such hazardous substances These environmental laws also assess liability on persons who arrange for hazardous substances to be sent to disposal or treatment facilities when such facilities are found to be contaminated Such persons can be responsible for cleanup costs even if they never owned or operated the contaminated facility We have been named as a responsible party at three Superfund sites in Sunnyvale California Although we have not yet been we could be named a potentially responsible party at other Superfund or contaminated sites in the future In addition contamination that has not yet been identified could exist at our other facilities Under the DoddFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 the SEC adopted disclosure and reporting requirements for companies that use conflict minerals originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo or adjoining countries We continue to incur additional costs associated with complying with these requirements such as costs related to developing internal controls for the due diligence process determining the source of any conflict minerals used in our products auditing the process and reporting to our customers and the SEC In addition to the SEC regulation the European Union China and other jurisdictions are developing new policies focused on conflict minerals that may impact and increase the cost of our compliance program Also since our supply chain is complex we may face reputational challenges if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of the subject minerals Moreover we are likely to encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products are certified as conflict free If we cannot satisfy these customers they may choose a competitors products Recently the US federal government has issued new policies for federal procurement focused on eradicating the practice of forced labor and human trafficking In addition the United Kingdom and the State of California have issued laws that require us to disclose our policy and practices for identifying and eliminating forced labor and human trafficking in our supply chain Several customers as well as the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition EICC have also issued expectations to eliminate these practices that may impact us While we have a policy and management systems to identify and avoid these practices in our supply chain we cannot guarantee that our suppliers will always be in conformance to these laws and expectations We may face enforcement liability and reputational challenges if we are unable to sufficiently meet these expectations Moreover we are likely to encounter challenges with customers if we cannot satisfy their forced and trafficked labor polices and they may choose a competitors products ITEM 1B UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None ITEM 2 PROPERTIES As of December 31 2016 we leased approximately 223 million square feet of space for research and development engineering administrative and warehouse use including our headquarters in Sunnyvale California our principal administrative facilities in Austin Texas our main facility with respect to graphics and chipset products located in Markham Ontario Canada and a number of smaller regional sales offices located in commercial centers near customers principally in the United States Latin America Europe and Asia These leases expire at varying dates through 2028 although some of these leases include optional renewals During the second quarter of 2016 we signed an amendment to the lease agreement associated with our headquarters in Sunnyvale California so that the lease expires a year earlier in December 2017 During the third quarter of 2016 we entered into a 10year operating lease to occupy 220156 square feet of new office space in Santa Clara California We estimate this lease to commence in August 2017 We have the option to extend the term of the lease for two additional 5year periods The lease for our principal administrative facilities in Austin Texas expires in March 2025 and provides for one 10year optional renewal The lease for our facilities in Markham Ontario Canada expires in February 2028 and provides for one 5year optional renewal 28 We currently do not anticipate difficulty in either retaining occupancy of any of our facilities through lease renewals prior to expiration or through monthtomonth occupancy or replacing them with equivalent facilities We also have approximately 101000 square feet of building space that is currently vacant We continue to have lease obligations with respect to portions of this space that expire at various dates through 2017 We believe that our existing facilities are suitable and adequate for our present purposes and that except as discussed above the productive capacity of such facilities is substantially being utilized or we have plans to utilize such capacity ITEM 3 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Securities Class Action On January 15 2014 a class action lawsuit captioned Hatamian v AMD et al  CA No 314cv00226 the Hatamian Lawsuit was filed against us in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California The complaint purports to assert

settlement of the lawsuit The discovery process is ongoing Based upon information presently known to management we believe that the potential liability if any will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition cash flows or results of operations Shareholder Derivative Lawsuits On March 20 2014 a purported shareholder derivative lawsuit captioned Wessels v Read et al  Case No 114 cv262486 Wessels was filed against us as a nominal defendant only and certain of our directors and officers in the Santa Clara County Superior Court of the State of California The complaint purports to assert claims against us and certain individual directors and officers for breach of fiduciary duty waste of corporate assets and unjust enrichment The complaint seeks damages allegedly caused by

Lawsuit and is now Case No 415cv04485 The Wessels Hamilton and Ha shareholder derivative lawsuits are currently stayed Based upon information presently known to management we believe that the potential liability if any will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition cash flows or results of operations ZiiLabs Litigation On December 16 2016 a patent lawsuit captioned ZiiLabs v AMD  CA No 216cv1418 in the United States District Court for Eastern District of Texas the ZiiLabs Lawsuit was filed against us in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas The complaint alleges that we infringed four patents related generally to graphics processors and memory controllers The complaint seeks damages interest and attorneys fees ZiiLabs filed several similar lawsuits against other companies on the same day On the same date ZiiLabs also filed a complaint with the United States International Trade Commission USITC pursuant to Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 against us and several other companies asserting the same four patents 29 The complaint seeks a limited exclusion order barring the importation of certain products that contain AMD memory controllers and graphics processors One of our customers is also a named respondent On January 18 2017 the USITC announced that it would institute the investigation entitled 337TA1037 In the Matter of Certain Graphics Processors DDR Memory Controllers and Products Containing the Same  Based upon information presently known to management we believe that the potential liability if any will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition cash flows or results of operations Environmental Matters We are named as a responsible party on Superfund cleanup orders for three sites in Sunnyvale California that are on the National Priorities List Since 1981 we have discovered hazardous material releases to the groundwater from former underground tanks and proceeded to investigate and conduct remediation at these three sites The chemicals released into the groundwater were commonly used in the semiconductor industry in the United States in the wafer fabrication process prior to 1979 In 1991 we received Final Site Cleanup Requirements Orders from the California Regional Water Quality Control Board relating to the three sites We have entered into settlement agreements with other responsible parties on two of the orders During the term of such agreements other parties have agreed to assume most of the foreseeable costs as well as the primary role in conducting remediation activities under the orders We remain responsible for additional costs beyond the scope of the agreements as well as all remaining costs in the event that the other parties do not fulfill their obligations under the settlement agreements To address anticipated future remediation costs under the orders we have computed and recorded an estimated environmental liability of approximately 4 million and have not recorded any potential insurance recoveries in determining the estimated costs of the cleanup Costs could also increase as a result of additional test and remediation obligations imposed by the Environmental Protection Agency or California Regional Water Quality Control Board The progress of future remediation efforts cannot be predicted with certainty and these costs may change We believe that the potential liability if any in excess of amounts already accrued will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition cash flows or results of operations Other Matters We are a defendant or plaintiff in various actions that arose in the normal course of business With respect to these matters based on our managements current knowledge we believe that the amount or range of reasonably possible loss if any will not either individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows ITEM 4 MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES Not Applicable 30 PART II
