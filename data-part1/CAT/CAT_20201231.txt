for supporting customers using machinery in infrastructure forestry and building construction The majority of machine sales in this segment are made in the heavy and general construction rental quarry and aggregates markets and mining The nature of customer demand for construction machinery varies around the world Customers in developing economies often prioritize purchase price in making their investment decisions while customers in developed economies generally weigh productivity and other performance criteria that contribute to lower owning and operating costs over the lifetime of the machine To meet customer expectations in developing economies Caterpillar developed differentiated product offerings that target customers in those markets including our SEM brand machines We believe that these customerdriven product innovations enable us to compete more effectively in developing economies The majority of Construction Industries research and development spending in 2020 focused on the next generation of construction machines The competitive environment for construction machinery is characterized by some global competitors and many regional and specialized local competitors Examples of global competitors include CASE part of CNH Industrial NV Deere Construction  Forestry part of Deere  Company Doosan Infracore Co Ltd Hitachi Construction Machinery Co Ltd Hyundai

manufacturer to assist machine sales Caterpillar and Cat Financial work together to provide a broad array of financial merchandising programs around the world to meet these competitive offers Cat Financials financial results are largely dependent upon the ability of Caterpillar dealers to sell equipment and customers willingness to enter into financing or leasing agreements Cat Financial is also affected by among other things the availability of funds from its financing sources its cost of funds relative to its competitors and general economic conditions such as inflation and market interest rates Cat Financial has a matchfunding policy that addresses interest rate risk by aligning the interest rate profile fixed or floating rate of its debt portfolio with the interest rate profile of its receivables portfolio within predetermined ranges on an ongoing basis In connection with that policy Cat Financial uses interest rate derivative instruments to modify the debt structure to match assets within the receivables portfolio This matched funding reduces the volatility of margins between interestbearing assets and interestbearing liabilities regardless of which direction interest rates move For more information regarding match funding please see Note 4  Derivative financial instruments and risk management of Part II Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data See also the risk factors associated with our financial products business included in Item 1 A of this Form 10K In managing foreign currency risk for Cat Financials operations the objective is to

support services are sold worldwide into a variety of highly competitive markets In all markets we compete on the basis of product performance customer service quality and price From time to time the intensity of competition results in price discounting in a particular industry or region Such price discounting puts pressure on margins and can negatively impact operating profit Outside the United States certain competitors enjoy competitive advantages inherent to operating in their home countries or regions Raw Materials and Component Products We source our raw materials and manufactured components from suppliers both domestically and internationally These purchases include unformed materials and rough and finished parts Unformed materials include a variety of steel products which are

machines engines and power generation units and to support our aftermarket dealer parts sales We also purchase various goods and services used in production logistics offices and product development processes We maintain global strategic sourcing models to meet our global facilities production needs while building longterm supplier relationships and leveraging enterprise spend We expect our suppliers to maintain at all times industryleading levels of quality and the ability to timely deliver raw materials and component products for our machine and engine products However in some cases increases in demand or supply chain disruptions have led to parts and components constraints across some products We use a variety of agreements with suppliers to protect our intellectual property and processes to monitor and mitigate risks of the supply base causing a business disruption The risks monitored include supplier financial viability the ability to increase or decrease production levels business continuity quality and delivery Patents and Trademarks We own a number of patents and trademarks which have been obtained over a period of years and relate to the products we manufacture and the services we provide These patents and trademarks are generally considered beneficial to our business We do not regard our business as being dependent upon any single patent or group of patents

this section describe the most significant risks to our business and should be considered carefully in conjunction with Part II Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of Part II Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data to this Form 10K In addition the statements in this section and other sections of this Form 10K including in Part II Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations include forwardlooking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and involve uncertainties that could significantly impact results Forwardlooking statements give current expectations or forecasts of future events about the company or our outlook You can identify forwardlooking statements by the fact they do not relate to historical or current facts and by the use of words such as believe expect estimate anticipate will be should plan forecast target guide project intend could and similar words or expressions Forwardlooking statements are based on assumptions and on known risks and uncertainties Although we believe we have been prudent in our assumptions any or all of our forwardlooking statements may prove to be inaccurate and we can make no guarantees about our future performance Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or underlying assumptions prove inaccurate actual results could materially differ from past results andor those anticipated estimated or projected We undertake no obligation to publicly update forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise You should however consult any subsequent disclosures we make in our filings with the SEC on Form 10Q or Form 8K The following is a cautionary discussion of risks uncertainties and assumptions that we believe are material to our business In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report the following are some of the important factors that individually or in the aggregate we believe could make our actual results differ materially from those described in any forwardlooking statements It is impossible to predict or identify all such factors and as a result you should not consider the following factors to be a complete discussion of risks uncertainties and assumptions RISKS RELATED TO THE COVID19 PANDEMIC The COVID19 pandemic could materially adversely affect our business results of operations andor financial condition COVID19 was identified in late 2019 and has spread globally The rapid spread has resulted in weaker demand and constrained supply and the implementation of numerous measures to try to contain the virus such as travel bans and restrictions quarantines shelter in place orders and shutdowns These factors have impacted and may continue to impact all or portions of our workforce and operations The COVID19 pandemic caused a global recession and it is uncertain when a sustained economic recovery may occur The COVID19 pandemic has also significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty and has led to a decrease in demand for the Companys products and services and caused supply chain disruptions Economic uncertainties could continue to affect demand for the Companys products and services the value of the equipment financed or leased the demand for financing and the financial condition and credit risk of our dealers and customers Uncertainties related to the magnitude and duration of the COVID19 pandemic including new strains may significantly adversely affect our business These uncertainties include the duration and impact of the resurgence in COVID19 cases in any country state or region prolonged reduction or closure of the Companys operations or a delayed recovery in our operations disruptions in the supply chain increased logistics costs the impact of the pandemic on the Companys customers and dealers the impact of disruptions in the global capital markets andor declines in our financial performance or credit ratings which could impact the Companys ability to obtain funding in the future and the impact of the pandemic on demand for our products and services as discussed above It is unclear when a sustained economic recovery could occur and what a recovery may look like All of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations andor financial condition The ultimate impact of the COVID19 pandemic on the Companys financial and operational results will be determined by the length of time that the pandemic continues its effect on the demand for the Companys products and services and the supply chain as well as the effect of governmental regulations imposed in response to the pandemic The overall magnitude of the COVID19 pandemic and the continued fluidity of the situation could materially and adversely impact our business results of operations andor financial condition 10 Table of Contents MACROECONOMIC RISKS Our business and the industries we serve are highly sensitive to global and regional economic conditions Our results of operations are materially affected by economic conditions globally and regionally and in the particular industries we serve The demand for our products and services tends to be cyclical and can be significantly reduced in periods of economic weakness characterized by lower levels of government and business investment lower levels of business confidence lower corporate earnings high real interest rates lower credit activity or tighter credit conditions perceived or actual industry overcapacity higher unemployment and lower consumer spending A prolonged period of economic weakness may also result in increased expenses due to higher allowances for doubtful accounts and potential goodwill and asset impairment charges Economic conditions vary across regions and countries and demand for our products and services generally increases in those regions and countries experiencing economic growth and investment Slower economic growth or a change in the global mix of regions and countries experiencing economic growth and investment could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition The energy transportation and mining industries are major users of our products including the coal iron ore gold copper oil and natural gas industries Customers in these industries frequently base their decisions to purchase our products and services on the expected future performance of these industries which in turn are dependent in part on commodity prices Prices of commodities in these industries are frequently volatile and can change abruptly and unpredictably in response to general economic conditions and trends government actions regulatory actions commodity inventories production and consumption levels technological innovations commodity substitutions market expectations and any disruptions in production or distribution or changes in consumption Economic conditions affecting the industries we serve may in the future also lead to reduced capital expenditures by our customers Reduced capital expenditures by our customers are likely to lead to a decrease in the demand for our products and services and may also result in a decrease in demand for aftermarket parts as customers are likely to extend preventative maintenance schedules and delay major overhauls when possible The rates of infrastructure spending commercial construction and housing starts also play a significant role in our results Our products are an integral component of these activities and as these activities decrease demand for our products may be significantly impacted which could negatively impact our results Commodity price changes material price increases fluctuations in demand for our products significant disruptions to our supply chains or significant shortages of material may adversely impact our financial results or our ability to meet commitments to customers We are a significant user of steel and many other commodities required for the manufacture of our products Increases in the prices of such commodities would increase our costs negatively impacting our business results of operations and financial condition if we are unable to fully offset the effect of these increased costs through price increases productivity improvements or cost reduction programs We rely on suppliers to produce or secure material required for the manufacture of our products Production challenges at suppliers including suppliers of semiconductors a disruption in deliveries to or from suppliers or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs On the other hand in circumstances where demand for our products is less than we expect we may experience excess inventories and be forced to incur additional costs and our profitability may suffer Additionally we have experienced and expect to continue to experience transportation delays for parts components and finished machines due to significant demands in global transportation and congestion at ports throughout the globe Our business competitive position results of operations or financial condition could be negatively impacted if supply is insufficient for our operations if significant transportation delays interfere with deliveries if we experience excess inventories or if we are unable to adjust our production schedules or our purchases from suppliers to reflect changes in customer demand and market fluctuations on a timely basis Changes in government monetary or fiscal policies may negatively impact our results  Most countries where our products and services are sold have established central banks to regulate monetary systems and influence economic activities generally by adjusting interest rates Interest rate changes affect overall economic growth which affects demand for residential and nonresidential structures as well as energy and mined products which in turn affects sales of our products and services that support these activities Interest rate changes may also affect our customers ability to finance machine purchases can change the optimal time to keep machines in a fleet and can impact the ability of our suppliers to finance the production of parts and components necessary to manufacture and support our products Increases in interest rates could negatively impact sales and create supply chain inefficiencies 11 Table of Contents Central banks and other policy arms of many countries may take actions to vary the amount of liquidity and credit available in an economy The impact from a change in liquidity and credit policies could negatively affect the customers and markets we serve or our suppliers create supply chain inefficiencies and could adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition Changes in monetary and fiscal policies along with other factors may cause currency exchange rates to fluctuate Actions that lead the currency exchange rate of a country where we manufacture products to increase relative to other currencies could reduce the competitiveness of products made in that country which could adversely affect our competitive position results of operations and financial condition Government policies on taxes and spending also affect our business Throughout the world government spending finances a significant portion of infrastructure development such as highways rail systems airports sewer and water systems waterways and dams Tax regulations determine asset depreciation lives and impact the aftertax returns on business activity and investment both of which influence investment decisions Unfavorable developments such as decisions to reduce public spending or to increase taxes could negatively impact our results Our global operations are exposed to political and economic risks commercial instability and events beyond our control in the countries in which we operate Our global operations are dependent upon products manufactured purchased and sold in the US and internationally including in countries with political and economic instability or uncertainty Some countries have greater political and economic volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than others Our business could be negatively impacted by adverse fluctuations in freight costs limitations on shipping and receiving capacity and other disruptions in the transportation and shipping infrastructure at important geographic points of exit and entry for our products Operating in different regions and countries exposes us to a number of risks including  multiple and potentially conflicting laws regulations and policies that are subject to change  imposition of currency restrictions restrictions on repatriation of earnings or other restraints  imposition of new or additional tariffs or quotas  withdrawal from or modification of trade agreements or the negotiation of new trade agreements  imposition of new or additional trade and economic sanctions laws imposed by the US or foreign governments  war or acts of terrorism and  political and economic instability or civil unrest that may severely disrupt economic activity in affected countries The occurrence of one or more of these events may negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition OPERATIONAL RISKS The success of our business depends on our ability to develop produce and market quality products that meet our customers needs Our business relies on continued global demand for our brands and products To achieve business goals we must develop and sell products that appeal to our dealers OEMs and enduser customers This is dependent on a number of factors including our ability to maintain key dealer relationships our ability to produce products that meet the quality performance and price expectations of our customers and our ability to develop effective sales advertising and marketing programs In addition our continued success in selling products that appeal to our customers is dependent on leadingedge innovation with respect to both products and operations and on the availability and effectiveness of legal protection for our innovations Failure to continue to deliver high quality innovative competitive products to the marketplace to adequately protect our intellectual property rights to supply products that meet applicable regulatory requirements including engine exhaust emission requirements or to predict market demands for or gain market acceptance of our products could have a negative impact on our business results of operations and financial condition 12 Table of Contents We operate in a highly competitive environment which could adversely affect our sales and pricing We operate in a highly competitive environment We compete on the basis of a variety of factors including product performance customer service quality and price There can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with other companies products Thus our share of industry sales could be reduced due to aggressive pricing or product strategies pursued by competitors unanticipated product or manufacturing difficulties our failure to price our products competitively our failure to produce our products at a competitive cost or an unexpected buildup in competitors new machine or dealerowned rental fleets which could lead to downward pressure on machine rental rates andor used equipment prices Lack of customer acceptance of price increases we announce from time to time changes in customer requirements for price discounts changes in our customers behavior or a weak pricing environment could have an adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition In addition our results and ability to compete may be impacted negatively by changes in our geographic and product mix of sales Increased information technology security threats and more sophisticated computer crime pose a risk to our systems networks products and services We rely upon information technology systems and networks some of which are managed by third parties in connection with a variety of business activities Additionally we collect and store sensitive information relating to our business customers dealers suppliers and employees Operating these information technology systems and networks and processing and maintaining this data in a secure manner is critical to our business operations and strategy Information technology security threats  from user error to cybersecurity attacks designed to gain unauthorized access to our systems networks and data  are increasing in frequency and sophistication Cybersecurity attacks may range from random attempts to coordinated and targeted attacks including sophisticated computer crime and advanced persistent threats These threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data Cybersecurity attacks could also include attacks targeting customer data or the security integrity andor reliability of the hardware and software installed in our products It is possible that our information technology systems and networks or those managed or provided by third parties could have vulnerabilities which could go unnoticed for a period of time While various procedures and controls have been and are being utilized to mitigate such risks there can be no guarantee that the actions and controls we have implemented and are implementing or which we cause or have caused third party service providers to implement will be sufficient to protect our systems information or other property We have experienced cyber security threats and vulnerabilities in our systems and those of our third party providers and we have experienced viruses and attacks targeting our information technology systems and networks Such prior events to date have not had a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity However the potential consequences of a future material cybersecurity attack include reputational damage litigation with third parties government enforcement actions penalties disruption to systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information corruption of data diminution in the value of our investment in research development and engineering and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness results of operations and financial condition Due to the evolving nature of such security threats the potential impact of any future incident cannot be predicted Further the amount of insurance coverage we maintain may be inadequate to cover claims or liabilities relating to a cybersecurity attack In addition data we collect store and process is subject to a variety of US and international laws and regulations such as the European Unions General Data Protection Regulation that became effective in May 2018 which may carry significant potential penalties for noncompliance 13 Table of Contents Our business is subject to the inventory management decisions and sourcing practices of our dealers and our OEM customers We sell finished products primarily through an independent dealer network and directly to OEMs and are subject to risks relating to their inventory management decisions and operational and sourcing practices Both carry inventories of finished products as part of ongoing operations and adjust those inventories based on their assessments of future needs and market conditions including levels of used equipment inventory and machine rental usage rates Such adjustments may impact our results positively or negatively If the inventory levels of our dealers and OEM customers are higher than they desire they may postpone product purchases from us which could cause our sales to be lower than the enduser demand for our products and negatively impact our results Similarly our results could be negatively impacted through the loss of timesensitive sales if our dealers and OEM customers do not maintain inventory levels sufficient to meet customer demand We may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions joint ventures or divestitures or these benefits may take longer to realize than expected In pursuing our business strategy we routinely evaluate targets and enter into agreements regarding possible acquisitions divestitures and joint ventures We often compete with others for the same opportunities To be successful we conduct due diligence to identify valuation issues and potential loss contingencies negotiate transaction terms complete complex transactions and manage postclosing matters such as the integration of acquired businesses Further while we seek to mitigate risks and liabilities of such transactions through due diligence among other things there may be risks and liabilities that our due diligence efforts fail to discover that are not accurately or completely disclosed to us or that we inadequately assess We may incur unanticipated costs or expenses following a completed acquisition including postclosing asset impairment charges expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities litigation and other liabilities Risks associated with our past or future acquisitions also include the following  the failure to achieve the acquisitions revenue or profit forecast  the business culture of the acquired business may not match well with our culture  technological and product synergies economies of scale and cost reductions may not occur as expected  unforeseen expenses delays or conditions may be imposed upon the acquisition including due to required regulatory approvals or consents  we may acquire or assume unexpected liabilities or be subject to unexpected penalties or other enforcement actions  faulty assumptions may be made regarding the macroeconomic environment or the integration process  unforeseen difficulties may arise in integrating operations processes and systems  higher than expected investments may be required to implement necessary compliance processes and related systems including information technology systems accounting systems and internal controls over financial reporting  we may fail to retain motivate and integrate key management and other employees of the acquired business  higher than expected costs may arise due to unforeseen changes in tax trade environmental labor safety payroll or pension policies in any jurisdiction in which the acquired business conducts its operations and  we may experience problems in retaining customers and integrating customer bases Many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of managements time and attention They may also delay the realization of the benefits we anticipate when we enter into a transaction In order to conserve cash for operations we may undertake acquisitions financed in part through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities or other arrangements Such acquisition financing could result in a decrease in our earnings and adversely affect other leverage measures If we issue equity securities or equitylinked securities the issued securities may have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our common shares 14 Table of Contents Failure to implement our acquisition strategy including successfully integrating acquired businesses could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations Furthermore we make strategic divestitures from time to time In the case of divestitures we may agree to indemnify acquiring parties for certain liabilities arising from our former businesses These divestitures may also result in continued financial involvement in the divested businesses following the transaction including through guarantees or other financial arrangements Lower performance by those divested businesses could affect our future financial results Union disputes or other labor matters could adversely affect our operations and financial results Some of our employees are represented by labor unions in a number of countries under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and expiration dates There can be no assurance that any current or future issues with our employees will be resolved or that we will not encounter future strikes work stoppages or other disputes with labor unions or our employees We may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate collective bargaining agreements in the United States and other countries when they expire If we fail to renegotiate our existing collective bargaining agreements we could encounter strikes or work stoppages or other disputes with labor unions In addition existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at our facilities in the future We may also be subject to general country strikes or work stoppages unrelated to our business or collective bargaining agreements A work stoppage or other limitations on production at our facilities for any reason could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition In addition many of our customers and suppliers have unionized work forces Strikes or work stoppages experienced by our customers or suppliers could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition Unexpected events may increase our cost of doing business or disrupt our operations The occurrence of one or more unexpected events including war acts of terrorism or violence civil unrest fires tornadoes tsunamis hurricanes earthquakes floods and other forms of severe weather in the United States or in other countries in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance Natural disasters pandemic illness including the current COVID19 outbreak equipment failures power outages or other unexpected events could result in physical damage to and complete or partial closure of one or more of our manufacturing facilities or distribution centers temporary or longterm disruption in the supply of component products from some local and international suppliers and disruption and delay in the transport of our products to dealers endusers and distribution centers Existing insurance coverage may not provide protection for all of the costs that may arise from such events FINANCIAL RISKS Disruptions or volatility in global financial markets could limit our sources of liquidity or the liquidity of our customers dealers and suppliers Continuing to meet our cash requirements over the longterm requires substantial liquidity and access to varied sources of funds including capital and credit markets Global economic conditions may cause volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets Market volatility changes in counterparty credit risk the impact of government intervention in financial markets and general economic conditions may also adversely impact our ability to access capital and credit markets to fund operating needs Global or regional economic downturns could cause financial markets to decrease the availability of liquidity credit and credit capacity for certain issuers including certain customers dealers and suppliers An inability to access capital and credit markets may have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and competitive position Furthermore changes in global economic conditions including material cost increases and decreases in economic activity in key markets we serve and the success of plans to manage cost increases inventory and other important elements of our business may significantly impact our ability to generate funds from operations In addition demand for our products generally depends on customers ability to pay for our products which in turn depends on their access to funds Changes in global economic conditions may result in customers experiencing increased difficulty in generating funds from operations Capital and credit market volatility and uncertainty may cause financial institutions to revise their lending standards resulting in customers decreased access to capital If capital and credit market volatility occurs customers liquidity may decline which in turn would reduce their ability to purchase our products 15 Table of Contents Failure to maintain our credit ratings would increase our cost of borrowing and could adversely affect our cost of funds liquidity competitive position and access to capital markets Each of Caterpillars and Cat Financials costs of borrowing and their respective ability to access the capital markets are affected not only by market conditions but also by the short and longterm credit ratings assigned to their respective debt by the major credit rating agencies These ratings are based in significant part on each of Caterpillars and Cat Financials performance as measured by financial metrics such as net worth interest coverage and leverage ratios as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting There can be no assurance that Caterpillar and Cat Financial will be able to maintain their credit ratings We receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies Moodys long and shortterm ratings of Caterpillar and Cat Financial are A3 and Prime2 lowA while other major credit rating agencies maintain a midA debt rating A downgrade of our credit rating by any of the major credit rating agencies would result in increased borrowing costs and could adversely affect Caterpillars and Cat Financials liquidity competitive position and access to the capital markets including restricting in whole or in part access to the commercial paper market There can be no assurance that the commercial paper market will continue to be a reliable source of shortterm financing for Cat Financial or an available source of shortterm financing for Caterpillar An inability to access the capital markets could have an adverse effect on our cash flow results of operations and financial condition Our Financial Products segment is subject to risks associated with the financial services industry Cat Financial is significant to our operations and provides financing support for a significant share of our global sales The inability of Cat Financial to access funds to support its financing activities to our customers could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition Continuing to meet Cat Financials cash requirements over the longterm could require substantial liquidity and access to sources of funds including capital and credit markets Cat Financial has continued to maintain access to key global medium term note and commercial paper markets but there can be no assurance that such markets will continue to represent a reliable source of financing If global economic conditions were to deteriorate Cat Financial could face materially higher financing costs become unable to access adequate funding to operate and grow its business andor meet its debt service obligations as they mature and be required to draw upon contractually committed lending agreements andor seek other funding sources However there can be no assurance that such agreements and other funding sources would be available or sufficient under extreme market conditions Any of these events could negatively impact Cat Financials business as well as our and Cat Financials results of operations and financial condition Market disruption and volatility may also lead to a number of other risks in connection with these events including but not limited to  Market developments that may affect customer confidence levels and cause declines in the demand for financing and adverse changes in payment patterns causing increases in delinquencies and default rates which could impact Cat Financials writeoffs and provision for credit losses  The process Cat Financial uses to estimate losses inherent in its credit exposure requires a high degree of managements judgment regarding numerous subjective qualitative factors including forecasts of economic conditions and how economic predictors might impair the ability of its borrowers to repay their loans Financial market disruption and volatility may impact the accuracy of these judgments  Cat Financials ability to engage in routine funding transactions or borrow from other financial institutions on acceptable terms or at all could be adversely affected by disruptions in the capital markets or other events including actions by rating agencies and deteriorating investor expectations  As Cat Financials lending agreements are primarily with financial institutions their ability to perform in accordance with any of its underlying agreements could be adversely affected by market volatility andor disruptions in financial markets 16 Table of Contents Changes in interest rates or market liquidity conditions could adversely affect Cat Financials and our earnings andor cash flow Changes in interest rates and market liquidity conditions could have an adverse impact on Cat Financials and our earnings and cash flows Because a significant number of the loans made by Cat Financial are made at fixed interest rates its business results are subject to fluctuations in interest rates Certain loans made by Cat Financial and various financing extended to Cat Financial are made at variable rates that use LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate LIBOR is the subject of recent proposals for reform On July 27 2017 the United Kingdoms Financial Conduct Authority FCA announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021 On November 18 2020 ICE Benchmark Administration IBA the administrator of USD LIBOR announced plans to consult on its intention to cease the publication of all GBP EUR CHF and JPY LIBOR settings immediately following the LIBOR publication on December 31 2021 On November 30 2020 IBA with the support of the United States Federal Reserve and the FCA announced plans to consult on ceasing publication of USD LIBOR on December 31 2021 for only the one week and two month USD LIBOR tenors and on June 30 2023 for all other USD LIBOR tenors While the November 30th announcement extends the transition period to June 2023 the United States Federal Reserve concurrently issued a statement advising banks to stop new USD LIBOR issuances by the end of 2021 These reforms may cause LIBOR to cease to exist new methods of calculating LIBOR to be established such that LIBOR continues to exist after 2021 or the establishment of an alternative reference rates Several offerings of securities that include such an alternative reference rate have now been completed by other companies The consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted and could have an adverse impact on the market value for or value of LIBORlinked securities loans derivatives and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to Cat Financial as well as the revenue and expenses associated with those securities loans and financial instruments Cat Financial has created a crossfunctional team that will assess risk across multiple categories as it relates to the use of LIBOR in securities loans derivatives and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to us Other changes in market interest rates may influence Cat Financials borrowing costs and could reduce its and our earnings and cash flows returns on financial investments and the valuation of derivative contracts Cat Financial manages interest rate and market liquidity risks through a variety of techniques that include a match funding strategy the selective use of derivatives and a broadly diversified funding program There can be no assurance however that fluctuations in interest rates and market liquidity conditions will not have an adverse impact on its and our earnings and cash flows If any of the variety of instruments and strategies Cat Financial uses to hedge its exposure to these types of risk is ineffective this may have an adverse impact on our earnings and cash flows With respect to Insurance Services investment activities changes in the equity and bond markets could result in a decline in value of its investment portfolio resulting in an unfavorable impact to earnings An increase in delinquencies repossessions or net losses of Cat Financial customers could adversely affect its results Inherent in the operation of Cat Financial is the credit risk associated with its customers The creditworthiness of each customer and the rate of delinquencies repossessions and net losses on customer obligations are directly impacted by several factors including relevant industry and economic conditions the availability of capital the experience and expertise of the customers management team commodity prices political events and the sustained value of the underlying collateral Any increase in delinquencies repossessions and net losses on customer obligations could have a material adverse effect on Cat Financials and our earnings and cash flows In addition although Cat Financial evaluates and adjusts its allowance for credit losses related to past due and nonperforming receivables on a regular basis adverse economic conditions or other factors that might cause deterioration of the financial health of its customers could change the timing and level of payments received and necessitate an increase in Cat Financials estimated losses which could also have a material adverse effect on Cat Financials and our earnings and cash flows Currency exchange rate fluctuations affect our results of operations We conduct operations in many countries involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies We are subject to currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues Fluctuations in currency exchange rates have had and will continue to have an impact on our results as expressed in US dollars There can be no assurance that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows While the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with protection from adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates In addition our outlooks do not assume fluctuations in currency exchange rates Adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates from the date of our outlooks could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in our outlooks and adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition 17 Table of Contents We also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations Exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into US dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls Currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation Restrictive covenants in our debt agreements could limit our financial and operating flexibility We maintain a number of credit facilities to support general corporate purposes facilities and have issued debt securities to manage liquidity and fund operations debt securities The agreements relating to a number of the facilities and the debt securities contain certain restrictive covenants applicable to us and certain subsidiaries including Cat Financial These covenants include maintaining a minimum consolidated net worth defined as the consolidated shareholders equity including preferred stock but excluding the pension and other postretirement benefits balance within accumulated other comprehensive income loss limitations on the incurrence of liens and certain restrictions on consolidation and merger Cat Financial has also agreed under certain of these agreements not to exceed a certain leverage ratio consolidated debt to consolidated net worth calculated 1 on a monthly basis as the average of the leverage ratios determined on the last day of each of the six preceding calendar months and 2 at each December 31 to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio profit excluding income taxes interest expense and net gainloss from interest rate derivatives to interest expense calculated at the end of each calendar quarter for the rolling four quarter period then most recently ended and not to terminate amend or modify its support agreement with us A breach of one or more of the covenants could result in adverse consequences that could negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition These consequences may include the acceleration of amounts outstanding under certain of the facilities triggering of an obligation to redeem certain debt securities termination of existing unused commitments by our lenders refusal by our lenders to extend further credit under one or more of the facilities or to enter into new facilities or the lowering or modification of our credit ratings or those of one or more of our subsidiaries Sustained increases in funding obligations under our pension plans may impair our liquidity or financial condition We maintain certain defined benefit pension plans for our employees which impose on us certain funding obligations In determining our future payment obligations under the plans we assume certain rates of return on the plan assets and a certain level of future benefit payments Significant adverse changes in credit or capital markets could result in actual rates of return being materially lower than projected and result in increased contribution requirements Our assumptions for future benefit payments may also change over time and could be materially higher than originally projected We expect to make contributions to our pension plans in the future and may be required to make contributions that could be material We may fund contributions through the use of cash on hand the proceeds of borrowings shares of our common stock or a combination of the foregoing as permitted by applicable law Our assumptions for future benefit payments may change over time and could be materially higher than projected These factors could significantly increase our payment obligations under the plans and as a result adversely affect our business and overall financial condition LEGAL  REGULATORY RISKS Our global operations are subject to a widerange of trade and anticorruption laws and regulations Due to the international scope of our operations we are subject to a complex system of import and exportrelated laws and regulations including US regulations issued by Customs and Border Protection the Bureau of Industry and Security the Office of Antiboycott Compliance the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls and the Office of Foreign Assets Control as well as the counterparts of these agencies in other countries Any alleged or actual violations may subject us to increased government scrutiny investigation and civil and criminal penalties and may limit our ability to import or export our products or to provide services outside the United States Furthermore embargoes and sanctions imposed by the US and other governments restricting or prohibiting sales to specific persons or countries or based on product classification may expose us to potential criminal and civil sanctions We cannot predict the nature scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or in certain locations the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted 18 Table of Contents In addition the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign anticorruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or obtaining an unfair advantage Recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anticorruption laws Our operations outside the United States including in developing countries expose us to the risk of such violations Violations of anticorruption laws or regulations by our employees intermediaries acting on our behalf or our joint venture partners may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions could disrupt our business and result in an adverse effect on our reputation business and results of operations or financial condition International trade policies may impact demand for our products and our competitive position Government policies on international trade and investment such as import quotas capital controls or tariffs whether adopted by individual governments or addressed by regional trade blocs can affect the demand for our products and services impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being able to sell products in certain countries The implementation of more restrictive trade policies such as more detailed inspections higher tariffs or new barriers to entry in countries where we sell large quantities of products and services could negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition For example a governments adoption of buy national policies or retaliation by another government against such policies could have a negative impact on our results of operations We may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous other jurisdictions Our future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings between US and nonUS jurisdictions or among jurisdictions with differing statutory tax rates changes in our overall profitability changes in tax laws or treaties or in their application or interpretation changes in tax rates changes in generally accepted accounting principles changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in the amount of earnings indefinitely reinvested in certain nonUS jurisdictions the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures We are also subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the US Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations If our effective tax rates were to increase or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued our operating results cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected For information regarding additional legal matters related to our taxes please see Note 6  Income taxes and Note 22  Environmental and legal matters of Part II Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data to this Annual Report on Form 10K  Costs associated with lawsuits or investigations or adverse rulings in enforcement or other legal proceedings may have an adverse effect on our results of operations We are subject to a variety of legal proceedings and legal compliance risks in virtually every part of the world We face risk of exposure to various types of claims lawsuits and government investigations We are involved in various claims and lawsuits related to product design manufacture and performance liability including claimed asbestos exposure contracts employment issues environmental matters intellectual property rights tax securities and other legal proceedings that arise in and outside of the ordinary course of our business The industries in which we operate are also periodically reviewed or investigated by regulators which could lead to enforcement actions fines and penalties or the assertion of private litigation claims It is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of claims investigations and lawsuits and we could in the future incur judgments fines or penalties or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have an adverse effect on our reputation business results of operations or financial condition in any particular period The global and diverse nature of our operations means that legal and compliance risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty may arise from time to time In addition subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of loss contingencies recorded as a reserve and require us to make payments in excess of our reserves which could have an adverse effect on our reputation business and results of operations or financial condition 19 Table of Contents New regulations or changes in financial services regulation could adversely impact Caterpillar and Cat Financial Cat Financials operations are highly regulated by governmental authorities in the locations where it operates which can impose significant additional costs andor restrictions on its business In the United States for example certain Cat Financial activities are subject to the US DoddFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act DoddFrank which includes extensive provisions regulating the financial services industry As a result Cat Financial has become and could continue to become subject to additional regulatory costs that could be significant and have an adverse effect on Cat Financial  s and our results of operations and financial condition Changes in regulations or additional regulations in the United States or internationally impacting the financial services industry could also add significant cost or operational constraints that might have an adverse effect on Cat Financial  s and our results of operations and financial condition We are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs Our facilities operations and products are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations globally including laws and regulations governing emissions to noise air releases to soil and discharges to water and the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of nonhazardous and hazardous waste materials Some environmental laws impose strict retroactive and joint and several liability for the remediation of the release of hazardous substances even for conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or for the conduct of or conditions caused by prior operators predecessors or other third parties Failure to comply with environmental laws could expose us to penalties or cleanup costs civil or criminal liability and sanctions on certain of our activities as well as damage to property or natural resources The potential liabilities sanctions damages and remediation efforts related to any noncompliance with such laws and regulations could negatively impact our ability to conduct our operations and our financial condition and results of operations In addition there can be no assurances that we will not be adversely affected by costs liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations or under present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future Environmental laws and regulations may change from time to time as may related interpretations and other guidance Changes in environmental laws or regulations could result in higher expenses and payments and uncertainty relating to environmental laws or regulations may also affect how we conduct our operations and structure our investments and could limit our ability to enforce our rights Changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations including laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions could lead to new or additional investment in product designs and could increase environmental compliance expenditures Changes in climate change concerns or in the regulation of such concerns including greenhouse gas emissions could subject us to additional costs and restrictions including increased energy and raw materials costs If environmental laws or regulations are either changed or adopted and impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon us or our products they could negatively impact our reputation business capital expenditures results of operations financial condition and competitive
