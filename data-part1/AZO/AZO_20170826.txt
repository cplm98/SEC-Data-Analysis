Adhesives Steering Wheel Covers Stereos  Radios Tools Wash  Wax We believe that the satisfaction of our customers is often impacted by our ability to provide specific automotive products as requested Each store carries the same basic products but we tailor our hard parts inventory to the makes and models of the vehicles in each stores trade area and our sales floor products are tailored to the local stores demographics Our hub stores including mega hubs which carry an even broader assortment carry a larger assortment of products that are delivered to local satellite stores We are constantly updating the products we offer to ensure that our inventory matches the products our customers need or desire Pricing We want to be the value leader in our industry by consistently providing quality merchandise at the right price backed by a satisfactory warranty and outstanding customer service For many of our products we offer multiple value choices in a goodbetterbest assortment with appropriate price and quality differences from the good products to the better and best products A key differentiating component versus our competitors is our exclusive line of inhouse brands which includes the Valucraft AutoZone SureBilt ProElite Duralast Duralast Max Duralast Gold Duralast Platinum Duralast ProPower and Duralast GT brands We believe that our overall value compares favorably to that of our competitors Brand Marketing Advertising and Promotions We believe that targeted advertising and promotions play important roles in succeeding in todays environment We are constantly working to understand our customers wants and needs so that we can build longlasting loyal relationships We utilize promotions advertising and loyalty programs primarily to highlight our great value and the availability of high quality parts Broadcast and internet media are our primary advertising methods of driving retail traffic to our stores while we leverage a dedicated sales force and our ProVantage loyalty program to drive commercial sales In the stores we utilize instore signage instore circulars and creative product placement and promotions to help educate customers about products that they need Store Design and Visual Merchandising We design and build stores for high visual impact The typical AutoZone store utilizes colorful exterior and interior signage exposed beams and ductwork and brightly lit interiors Maintenance products accessories and nonautomotive items are attractively displayed for easy browsing by customers Instore signage and special displays promote products on floor displays end caps and shelves 6 Table of Contents Commercial Our commercial sales program operates in a highly fragmented market and we are one of the leading distributors of automotive parts and other products to local regional and national repair garages dealers service stations and public sector accounts in the United States Puerto Rico and Mexico As a part of the domestic store program we offer credit and delivery to our customers as well as online ordering through wwwautozoneprocom and wwwimcpartsnet Through our hub stores we offer a greater range of parts and products desired by professional technicians We have dedicated sales teams focused on independent repair shops as well as national regional and public sector commercial accounts Store Operations Store Formats Substantially all AutoZone stores are based on standard store formats resulting in generally consistent appearance merchandising and product mix Approximately 85 to 90 of each stores square footage is selling space In our satellite stores approximately 40 to 45 of our space is dedicated to hard parts inventory while our hub stores and mega hubs have 75 to 85 of their space utilized for hard parts The hard parts inventory area is generally fronted by counters or pods that run the depth or length of the store dividing the hard parts area from the remainder of the store The remaining selling space contains displays of maintenance accessories and nonautomotive items We believe that our stores are destination stores generating their own traffic rather than relying on traffic created by adjacent stores Therefore we situate most stores on major thoroughfares with easy access and good parking Store Personnel and Training We provide onthejob training as well as formal training programs including an annual national sales meeting store meetings on specific sales and product topics standardized training manuals and computer based modules and a specialist program that provides training to AutoZoners in several areas of technical expertise from the Company our vendors and independent certification agencies All domestic AutoZoners are encouraged to complete tests resulting in certifications by the National Institute for Automotive Service Excellence ASE which is broadly recognized for training certification in the automotive industry Training is supplemented with frequent store visits by management Store managers sales representatives commercial sales managers and managers at various levels across the organization receive financial incentives through performancebased bonuses In addition our growth has provided opportunities for the promotion of qualified AutoZoners We believe these opportunities are important to attract motivate and retain high quality AutoZoners All store and branch support functions are centralized in our store support centers located in Memphis Tennessee Monterrey Mexico Chihuahua Mexico and Sao Paulo Brazil and our branch support center located in Canoga Park California We believe that this centralization enhances consistent execution of our merchandising and marketing strategies at the store level while reducing expenses and cost of sales Store Automation All of our AutoZone stores have Znet our proprietary electronic catalog that enables our AutoZoners to efficiently look up the parts that our customers need and to provide complete job solutions advice and information for customer vehicles Znet provides parts information based on the year make model and engine type of a vehicle and also tracks inventory availability at the store at other nearby stores and through special order The Znet display screens are placed on the hard parts counter or pods where both the AutoZoner and customer can view the screen Our AutoZone stores utilize our computerized proprietary Store Management System which includes bar code scanning and pointofsale data collection terminals The Store Management System provides administrative assistance and improved personnel scheduling at the store level as well as enhanced merchandising information and improved inventory control We believe the Store Management System also enhances customer service through faster processing of transactions and simplified warranty and product return procedures 7 Table of Contents Store Development The following table reflects our location development during the past five fiscal years Fiscal Year 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 Locations Beginning 5814 5609 5391 5201 5006 Acquired 1   17   New 215 205 202 190 197 Closed   1  2 Net new 215 205 201 190 195 Relocated 5 6 5 8 11 Ending 6029 5814 5609 5391 5201 1 17 IMC branches acquired on September 27 2014 We believe that expansion opportunities exist in markets that we do not currently serve as well as in markets where we can achieve a larger presence We undertake substantial research prior to entering new markets The most important criteria for opening a new AutoZone store or IMC branch are the projected future profitability and the ability to achieve our required investment hurdle rate Key factors in selecting new site and market locations for AutoZone stores and IMC branches include population demographics vehicle profile customer buying trends commercial businesses number and strength of competitors stores and the cost of real estate In reviewing the vehicle profile we also consider the number of vehicles that are seven years old and older or our kind of vehicles these vehicles are generally no longer under the original manufacturers warranties and require more maintenance and repair than newer vehicles We seek to open new AutoZone stores in high visibility sites in high traffic locations within or contiguous to existing market areas and attempt to cluster development in markets in a relatively short period of time When selecting future sites and market locations for our IMC branches we look for locations close to major highways to support IMCs delivery schedule and also consider the population of AutoZone stores in the market In addition to continuing to lease or develop our own locations we evaluate and may make strategic acquisitions Purchasing and Supply Chain Merchandise is selected and purchased for all AutoZone stores through our store support centers located in Memphis Tennessee Monterrey Mexico and Sao Paulo Brazil Additionally we have an office in Shanghai China to support our sourcing efforts in Asia Merchandise is selected and purchased for all IMC branches through our branch support center located in Canoga Park California In fiscal 2017 one class of similar products accounted for approximately 11 percent of our total sales and one vendor supplied approximately 11 percent of our purchases No other class of similar products accounted for 10 percent or more of our total sales and no other individual vendor provided more than 10 percent of our total purchases We believe that alternative sources of supply exist at similar costs for most types of product sold Most of our merchandise flows through our distribution centers to our stores by our fleet of tractors and trailers or by thirdparty trucking firms We ended fiscal 2017 with 186 domestic hub stores which have a larger assortment of products as well as regular replenishment items that can be delivered to a store in its network within 24 hours Hub stores are generally replenished from distribution centers multiple times per week Hub stores have increased our ability to distribute products on a timely basis to many of our stores and to expand our product assortment During fiscal 2014 and 2015 we tested two new concepts of our domestic supply chain strategy increased delivery frequency to our stores utilizing our distribution centers and significantly expanded parts assortments in select stores we call mega hubs Our tests were concluded during fiscal 2015 and both initiatives were expanded to additional locations in fiscal 2016 and 2017 8 Table of Contents Increased delivery frequency focuses on improving our instock position of our core storestocked product by providing deliveries to certain stores multiple times per week We are continuing to test our new frequency of delivery for certain volume stores to ensure the model is producing sufficient benefit to justify the costs We had roughly 2300 stores receiving more deliveries multiple times per week at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2017 As the results have not been conclusive to date we are continuing to test different scenarios to determine the optimal approach A mega hub store carries inventory of 80000 to 100000 unique SKUs approximately twice what a hub store carries Mega hubs provide coverage to both surrounding stores and other hub stores multiple times a day or on an overnight basis Currently we have over 4000 stores with access to mega hub inventory A majority of these 4000 stores receive their service on an overnight basis today but as we expand our mega hubs more of them will receive this service same day and many will receive it multiple times per day We ended fiscal 2017 with 16 mega hubs an increase of five since fiscal 2016 Competition The sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive in many areas including name recognition product

could have a material adverse effect on our business These risks are not the only ones we face Our business could also be affected by additional factors that are presently unknown to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial to our business If demand for our products slows then our business may be materially adversely affected Demand for the products we sell may be affected by a number of factors we cannot control including  the number of older vehicles in service Vehicles seven years old or older are generally no longer under the original vehicle manufacturers warranties and tend to need more maintenance and repair than newer vehicles  rising energy prices Increases in energy prices may cause our customers to defer purchases of certain of our products as they use a higher percentage of their income to pay for gasoline and other energy costs and may drive their vehicles less resulting in less wear and tear and lower demand for repairs and maintenance  the economy In periods of declining economic conditions consumers may defer vehicle maintenance or repair and discretionary spending Additionally such conditions may affect our customers ability to obtain credit During periods of expansionary economic conditions more of our DIY customers may pay others to repair and maintain their vehicles instead of working on their own vehicles or they may purchase new vehicles  the weather Mild weather conditions may lower the failure rates of automotive parts while wet conditions may cause our customers to defer maintenance and repair on their vehicles Extremely hot or cold conditions may enhance demand for our products due to increased failure rates of our customers automotive parts  technological advances Advances in automotive technology and parts design can result in cars needing maintenance less frequently and parts lasting longer For the long term demand for our products may be affected by  the number of miles vehicles are driven annually Higher vehicle mileage increases the need for maintenance and repair Mileage levels may be affected by gas prices and other factors  the quality of the vehicles manufactured by the original vehicle manufacturers and the length of the warranties or maintenance offered on new vehicles  restrictions on access to telematics and diagnostic tools and repair information imposed by the original vehicle manufacturers or by governmental regulation which may cause vehicle owners to rely on dealers to perform maintenance and repairs All of these factors could result in immediate and longer term declines in the demand for our products which could adversely affect our sales cash flows and overall financial condition If we are unable to compete successfully against other businesses that sell the products that we sell we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline The sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive and sales volumes are dependent on many factors including name recognition product availability customer service store location and price Competitors are opening locations near our existing locations AutoZone competes as a provider in both the DIY and DIFM auto parts and accessories markets 12 Table of Contents Our competitors include national regional and local auto parts chains independently owned parts stores online automotive parts stores or marketplaces wholesale distributors jobbers repair shops car washes and auto dealers in addition to discount and mass merchandise stores hardware stores supermarkets drugstores convenience stores home stores and other retailers that sell aftermarket vehicle parts and supplies chemicals accessories tools and maintenance parts Although we believe we compete effectively on the basis of customer service including the knowledge and expertise of our AutoZoners merchandise quality selection and availability product warranty store layout location and convenience price and the strength of our AutoZone brand name trademarks and service marks some of our competitors may gain competitive advantages such as greater financial and marketing resources allowing them to sell automotive products at lower prices larger stores with more merchandise longer operating histories more frequent customer visits and more effective advertising Online and multichannel retailers often focus on delivery services offering customers faster guaranteed delivery times and lowprice or free shipping Some online businesses have lower operating costs than we do and may not be required to collect and remit sales taxes in all US states which may negatively impact our ability to be pricecompetitive on a taxincluded basis In addition because our business strategy is based on offering superior levels of customer service to complement the products we offer our cost structure is higher than some of our competitors which also puts pressure on our margins Consumers are embracing shopping online and through mobile commerce applications With the increasing use of digital tools and social media and our competitors increased focus on optimizing customers online experience our customers are quickly able to compare prices product assortment and feedback from other customers before purchasing our products either online in the physical stores or through a combination of both offerings We believe that we compete effectively on the basis of merchandise availability as a result of investments in inventory available for immediate sale the development of a robust hub and mega hub distribution network providing efficient access to obtain products required ondemand options to order products online or by telephone and pick them up in stores and options for special orders directly from our vendors We also offer hasslefree returns to our customers In addition we believe that customers value the personal interaction with a salesperson that is qualified to offer trustworthy advice and provide other free services such as parts testing We also utilize promotions advertising and our loyalty programs to drive customer traffic and compete more effectively and we must regularly assess and adjust our efforts to address changes in the competitive marketplace If we are unable to continue to manage readilyavailable inventory demand and competitive delivery options as well as develop successful competitive strategies including the maintenance of effective promotions advertising and loyalty card programs or if our competitors develop more effective strategies we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline We may not be able to sustain our historic rate of sales growth We have increased our location count in the past five fiscal years growing from 5006 locations at August 25 2012 to 6029 locations at August 26 2017 an average location increase per year of 4 Additionally we have increased annual revenues in the past five fiscal years from 8604 billion in fiscal 2012 to 10889 billion in fiscal 2017 an average increase per year of 5 Annual revenue growth is driven by the opening of new locations the development of new commercial programs and increases in same store sales We open new locations only after evaluating customer buying trends and market demandneeds all of which could be adversely affected by persistent unemployment wage cuts small business failures and microeconomic conditions unique to the automotive industry Same store sales are impacted both by customer demand levels and by the prices we are able to charge for our products which can also be negatively impacted by the economic pressures mentioned above We cannot provide any assurance that we will continue to open locations at historical rates or continue to achieve increases in same store sales Consolidation among our competitors may negatively impact our business Historically some of our competitors have merged Consolidation among our competitors could enhance their market share and financial position provide them with the ability to achieve better purchasing terms and provide more competitive prices to customers for whom we compete and allow them to utilize merger synergies and cost savings to increase advertising and marketing budgets to more effectively compete for customers Consolidation by our competitors could also increase their access to local market parts assortment 13 Table of Contents These consolidated competitors could take sales volume away from us in certain markets could achieve greater market penetration could cause us to change our pricing with a negative impact on our margins or could cause us to spend more money to maintain customers or seek new customers all of which could negatively impact our business If we cannot profitably increase our market share in the commercial auto parts business our sales growth may be limited Although we are one of the largest sellers of auto parts in the commercial market we must effectively compete against national and regional auto parts chains independently owned parts stores wholesalers and jobbers in order to increase our commercial market share Although we believe we compete effectively in the commercial market on the basis of customer service merchandise quality selection and availability price product warranty distribution locations and the strength of our AutoZone brand name trademarks and service marks some automotive aftermarket participants have been in business for substantially longer periods of time than we have and as a result have developed longterm customer relationships and have large available inventories If we are unable to profitably develop new commercial customers our sales growth may be limited A downgrade in our credit ratings or a general disruption in the credit markets could make it more difficult for us to access funds refinance our debt obtain new funding or issue securities Our shortterm and longterm debt is rated investment grade by the major rating agencies These investmentgrade credit ratings have historically allowed us to take advantage of lower interest rates and other favorable terms on our shortterm credit lines in our senior debt offerings and in the commercial paper markets To maintain our investmentgrade ratings we are required to meet certain financial performance ratios A change by the rating agencies in these ratios an increase in our debt andor a decline in our earnings could result in downgrades in our credit ratings A downgrade in our credit ratings could limit our access to public debt markets limit the institutions willing to provide credit facilities to us result in more restrictive financial and other covenants in our public and private debt and would likely significantly increase our overall borrowing costs and adversely affect our earnings Moreover significant deterioration in the financial condition of large financial institutions during the Great Recession resulted in a severe loss of liquidity and availability of credit in global credit markets and in more stringent borrowing terms During brief time intervals there was limited liquidity in the commercial paper markets resulting in an absence of commercial paper buyers and extraordinarily high interest rates We can provide no assurance that such similar events that occurred during the Great Recession will not occur again in the foreseeable future Conditions and events in the global credit markets could have a material adverse effect on our access to shortterm and longterm debt and the terms and cost of that debt Significant changes in macroeconomic and geopolitical factors could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations Macroeconomic conditions impact both our customers and our suppliers Job growth in the US was stagnated and unemployment was at historically high levels during the Great Recession however in recent years the unemployment rate has improved to prerecession levels Moreover the United States government continues to operate under historically large deficits and debt burden Continued distress in global credit markets business failures inflation foreign exchange rate fluctuations significant geopolitical conflicts continued volatility in energy prices and other factors continue to affect the global economy Moreover rising energy prices could impact our merchandise distribution commercial delivery utility and product costs Over the short term such factors could positively impact our business Over a longer period of time all of these macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions could adversely affect our sales growth margins and overhead which could adversely affect our financial condition and operations 14 Table of Contents Our business depends upon hiring and retaining qualified employees We believe that much of our brand value lies in the quality of the more than 87000 AutoZoners employed in our stores distribution centers store support centers ALLDATA AutoAnything and IMC Our workforce costs represent our largest operating expense and our business is subject to employment laws and regulations including requirements related to minimum wage and benefits In addition the implementation of potential regulatory changes relating to overtime exemptions and benefits for certain employees under federal and state laws could result in increased labor costs to our business and negatively impact our operating results We cannot be assured that we can continue to hire and retain qualified employees at current wage rates since we operate in a competitive labor market and there is a risk of market increases in compensation If we are unable to hire properly train andor retain qualified employees we could experience higher employment costs reduced sales losses of customers and diminution of our brand which could adversely affect our earnings If we do not maintain competitive wages our customer service could suffer due to a declining quality of our workforce or alternatively our earnings could decrease if we increase our wage rates A violation or change in employment laws andor regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows Inability to acquire and provide quality merchandise at competitive prices could adversely affect our sales and results of operations We are dependent upon our domestic and international vendors continuing to supply us with quality merchandise at favorable prices and payment terms If our merchandise offerings do not meet our customers expectations regarding quality and safety we could experience lost sales increased costs and exposure to legal and reputational risk All of our vendors must comply with applicable product safety laws and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety and quality standards Events that give rise to actual potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to government enforcement action or private litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities To the extent our suppliers are subject to added government regulation of their product design andor manufacturing processes the cost of the merchandise we purchase may rise In addition negative customer perceptions regarding the safety or quality of the products we sell could cause our customers to seek alternative sources for their needs resulting in lost sales In those circumstances it may be difficult and costly for us to rebuild our reputation and regain the confidence of our customers Moreover our vendors are impacted by global economic conditions Credit market and other macroeconomic conditions could have a material adverse effect on the ability of our suppliers to finance and operate their businesses resulting in increased product costs and difficulties in meeting our inventory demands If any of our significant vendors experience financial difficulties or otherwise are unable to deliver merchandise to us on a timely basis or at all we could have product shortages in our stores that could adversely affect customers perceptions of us and cause us to lose customers and sales We directly imported approximately 10 of our purchases in fiscal 2017 but many of our domestic vendors directly import their products or components of their products Disruptions in the price or flow of these goods for any reason such as political unrest or acts of war currency fluctuations disruptions in maritime lanes port labor disputes and economic conditions and instability in the countries in which foreign suppliers are located the financial instability of suppliers suppliers failure to meet our standards issues with labor practices of our suppliers or labor problems they may experience such as strikes stoppages or slowdowns which could also increase labor costs during and following the disruption the availability and cost of raw materials to suppliers increased import duties merchandise quality or safety issues transport availability and cost increases in wage rates and taxes transport security inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located or from which they import are beyond our control and could adversely affect our operations and profitability In addition the United States foreign trade policies tariffs and other impositions on imported goods trade sanctions imposed on certain countries the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade and port labor agreements are beyond our control These and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our business and financial performance As we increase our imports of merchandise from foreign vendors the risks associated with these imports will also increase 15 Table of Contents Our ability to grow depends in part on new location openings existing location remodels and expansions and effective utilization of our existing supply chain and hub network Our continued growth and success will depend in part on our ability to open and operate new locations and expand and remodel existing locations to meet customers needs on a timely and profitable basis Accomplishing our new and existing location expansion goals will depend upon a number of factors including the ability to partner with developers and landlords to obtain suitable sites for new and expanded locations at acceptable costs the hiring and training of qualified personnel and the integration of new locations into existing operations There can be no assurance we will be able to achieve our location expansion goals manage our growth effectively successfully integrate the planned new locations into our operations or operate our new remodeled and expanded locations profitably In addition we extensively utilize our hub network our supply chain and logistics management techniques to efficiently stock our locations We have made and plan to continue to make significant investments in our supply chain to improve our ability to provide the best parts at the right price and to meet consumer product needs If we fail to effectively utilize our existing hubs andor supply chains or if our investments in our supply chain initiatives including directly sourcing some products from outside the United States do not provide the anticipated benefits we could experience suboptimal inventory levels in our locations or increases in our operating costs which could adversely affect our sales volume andor our margins Our failure to protect our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our brand name and profitability We believe our continued strong sales growth is driven in significant part by our brand name The value in our brand name and its continued effectiveness in driving our sales growth are dependent to a significant degree on our ability to maintain our reputation for safety high product quality friendliness service trustworthy advice integrity and business ethics Any negative publicity about these areas could damage our reputation and may result in reduced demand for our merchandise The increasing use of technology also poses a risk as customers are able to quickly compare products and prices and use social media to provide feedback in a manner that is rapidly and broadly dispersed Our reputation could be impacted if customers have a bad experience and share it over social media Failure to comply with ethical social product labor environmental and anticorruption standards could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse actions by consumer or environmental groups employees or regulatory bodies Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations to maintain an effective system of internal controls or to provide accurate and timely financial statement information could also hurt our reputation If we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions while incurring substantial legal fees and costs In addition our capital and operating expenses could increase due to implementation of and compliance with existing and future laws and regulations or remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any existing or future laws or regulations The inability to pass through any increased expenses through higher prices would have an adverse effect on our results of operations Damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation Our success in international operations is dependent on our ability to manage the unique challenges presented by international markets The various risks we face in our US operations generally also exist when conducting operations in and sourcing products and materials from outside of the US in addition to the unique costs risks and difficulties of managing international operations Our expansion into international markets may be adversely affected by local laws and customs US laws applicable to foreign operations and political and socioeconomic conditions 16 Table of Contents Risks inherent in international operations also include potential adverse tax consequences potential changes to trade policies and trade agreements compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local antibribery and anticorruption laws greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights challenges to identify and gain access to local suppliers and possibly misjudging the response of consumers in foreign countries to our product assortment and marketing strategy In addition our operations in international markets are conducted primarily in the local currency of those countries Since our consolidated financial statements are denominated in US dollars amounts of assets liabilities net sales and other revenues and expenses denominated in local currencies must be translated into US dollars using exchange rates for the current period As a result foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may adversely impact our financial performance Failure to protect or effectively respond to a breach of the privacy and security of customers suppliers AutoZoners or Company information could damage our reputation subject us to litigation and cause us to incur substantial costs Our business like that of most retailers and distributors involves the receipt storage and transmission of personal information about our customers suppliers and AutoZoners some of which is entrusted to thirdparty service providers and vendors Failure to protect the security of our customers suppliers employees and company information could subject us to costly regulatory enforcement actions expose us to litigation and impair our reputation which may have a negative impact on our sales While we and our thirdparty service providers and vendors take significant steps to protect customer supplier employee and other confidential information including maintaining compliance with payment card industry standards these security measures may be breached in the future due to cyberattack employee error system compromises fraud trickery hacking or other intentional or unintentional acts and unauthorized parties may obtain access to this data Failure to effectively respond to system compromises may undermine our security measures The methods used to obtain unauthorized access are constantly evolving and may be difficult to anticipate or detect for long periods of time As the regulatory environment related to information security data collection and use and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous compliance with these requirements could also result in significant additional costs We accept payments using a variety of methods including cash checks credit debit and gift cards and we may offer new payment options over time which may have information security risk implications As a retailer accepting debit and credit cards for payment we are subject to various industry data protection standards and protocols such as the American National Standards Institute encryption standards and payment network security operating guidelines and Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard Even though we comply with these standards and protocols and other information security measures we cannot be certain that the security measures we maintain to protect all of our information technology systems are able to prevent contain or detect any cyberattacks cyber terrorism or security breaches from known cyberattacks or malware that may be developed in the future To the extent that any cyberattack or incursion in our or one of our thirdparty service providers information systems results in the loss damage or misappropriation of information we may be materially adversely affected by claims from customers financial institutions regulatory authorities payment card networks and others In certain circumstances payment card association rules and obligations to which we are subject under our contracts with payment card processors make us liable to payment card issuers if information in connection with payment cards and payment card transactions that we hold is compromised which liabilities could be substantial In addition the cost of complying with stricter and more complex data privacy data collection and information security laws and standards could be significant to us We rely heavily on our information technology systems for our key business processes Any failure or interruption in these systems could have a material adverse impact on our business We rely extensively on our information technology systems some of which are managed or provided by thirdparty service providers to manage inventory communicate with customers process transactions and summarize results Our systems and the thirdparty systems we rely on are subject to damage or interruption from power outages telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches malicious cyberattacks catastrophic events and design or usage errors by our AutoZoners contractors or thirdparty service providers Although we and our thirdparty service providers work diligently to maintain our respective systems we may not be successful in doing so 17 Table of Contents If our systems are damaged or fail to function properly we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them and may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process transactions which could result in lost sales inability to process purchase orders andor a potential loss of customer loyalty which could adversely affect our results of operations Business interruptions may negatively impact our location hours operability of our computer and other systems availability of merchandise and otherwise have a material negative effect on our sales and our business War or acts of terrorism political unrest unusual weather conditions hurricanes tornadoes windstorms fires earthquakes floods and other natural or other disasters or the threat of any of them may result in certain of our locations being closed for a period of time or permanently or have a negative impact on our ability to obtain merchandise available for sale in our locations Some of our merchandise is imported from other countries If imported goods become difficult or impossible to bring into the United States and if we cannot obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar costs our sales and profit margins may be negatively affected In the event that commercial transportation is curtailed or substantially delayed our business may be adversely impacted as we may have difficulty shipping merchandise to our distribution centers and locations resulting in lost sales andor a potential loss of customer loyalty Transportation issues could also cause us to cancel purchase orders if we are unable to receive merchandise in our distribution centers Item 1B Unresolved Staff Comments None Item 2 Properties The following table

Chihuahua Mexico and Sao Paulo Brazil and an IMC branch support center located in Canoga Park California The ALLDATA headquarters in Elk Grove California and the AutoAnything headquarters space in San Diego California are leased and we also own or lease other properties that are not material in the aggregate Item 3 Legal Proceedings In 2004 we acquired a store site in Mount Ephraim New Jersey that had previously been the site of a gasoline service station and contained evidence of groundwater contamination Upon acquisition we voluntarily reported the groundwater contamination issue to the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection NJDEP and entered into a Voluntary Remediation Agreement providing for the remediation of the contamination associated with the property We have conducted and paid for at an immaterial cost to us remediation of contamination on the property 18 Table of Contents We have also voluntarily investigated and addressed potential vapor intrusion impacts in downgradient residences and businesses The NJDEP has asserted in a Directive and Notice to Insurers dated February 19 2013 and again in an Amended Directive and Notice to Insurers dated January 13 2014 collectively the Directives that we are liable for the downgradient impacts under a joint and severable liability theory By letter dated April 23 2015 NJDEP has demanded payment from us and other parties in the amount of approximately 296 thousand for costs incurred by NJDEP in connection with contamination downgradient of the property By letter dated January 29 2016 we were informed that NJDEP has filed a lien against the property in connection with approximately 355 thousand in costs incurred by NJDEP in connection with contamination downgradient of the property We have contested and will continue to contest any such assertions due to the existence of other entitiessources of contamination some of which are named in the Directives and the April 23 2015 demand in the area of the property Pursuant to the Voluntary Remediation Agreement upon completion of all remediation required by the agreement we believe we should be eligible to be reimbursed up to 75 percent of qualified remediation costs by the State of New Jersey We have asked the state for clarification that the agreement applies to offsite work and the state is considering the request Although the aggregate amount of additional costs that we may incur pursuant to the remediation cannot currently be ascertained we do not currently believe that fulfillment of our obligations under the agreement or otherwise will result in costs that are material to our financial condition results of operations or cash flow In July 2014 we received a subpoena from the District Attorney of the County of Alameda along with other environmental prosecutorial offices in the state of California seeking documents and information related to the handling storage and disposal of hazardous waste We received notice that the District Attorney will seek injunctive and monetary relief We are cooperating fully with the request and cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these efforts although we have accrued all amounts we believe to be probable and reasonably estimable We do not believe the ultimate resolution of this matter will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows In April 2016 we received a letter from the California Air Resources Board seeking payment for alleged violations of the California Health and Safety Code related to the sale of certain aftermarket emission parts in the State of California We do not believe that any resolution of the matter will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows We are involved in various other legal proceedings incidental to the conduct of our business including several lawsuits containing classaction allegations in which the plaintiffs are current and former hourly and salaried employees who allege various wage and hour violations and unlawful termination practices We do not currently believe that either individually or in the aggregate these matters will result in liabilities material to our financial condition results of operations or cash flows Item 4 Mine Safety Disclosures Not applicable 19 Table of Contents
