parts through wwwautozonecom for pickup in store or to be shipped directly to a customers home or business with next day delivery covering approximately 80 of the US population Additionally we offer a

Tools Towing Wash  Wax  We believe that customer satisfaction is often impacted by our ability to promptly provide specific automotive products as requested Each store carries the same basic products but we tailor our hard parts inventory to the makes and models of the vehicles in each stores trade area and our sales floor products are tailored to the local stores demographics Our hub stores including mega hubs which carry an even broader assortment carry a larger assortment of products that are delivered to local satellite stores We are constantly updating the products we offer to ensure that our inventory matches the products our customers need or desire 6   Pricing We want to be the value leader in our industry by consistently providing quality merchandise at the right price backed by a satisfactory warranty and outstanding customer service For many of our products we offer multiple value choices in a goodbetterbest assortment with appropriate price and quality differences from the good products to the better and best products A key differentiating component versus our competitors is our exclusive line of inhouse brands which includes Duralast and the family of Duralast brands ProElite ShopPro SureBilt TruGrade and Valucraft We believe that our overall value compares favorably to that of our competitors Brand Marketing Marketing and Loyalty We believe that targeted advertising and promotions play important roles in succeeding in todays environment We are constantly working to understand our customers wants and needs so that we can build longlasting loyal relationships We utilize advertising direct marketing loyalty programs and promotions primarily to highlight our great value the availability of high quality parts and develop a relationship with an expanding base of customers Broadcast and digital media are our primary advertising methods of driving retail traffic to our stores while we leverage a dedicated sales force and our ProVantage loyalty program to drive commercial sales Store Design Visual Merchandising and Promotional Execution We design and build stores for high visual impact The typical store utilizes colorful exterior and interior signage exposed beams and ductwork and brightly lit interiors Maintenance products accessories and nonautomotive items are attractively displayed for easy browsing by customers Instore signage and special displays promote products on floor displays end caps and shelves We utilize instore signage instore circulars and creative product placement and promotions to help educate customers about products that they need Commercial Our commercial sales program operates in a highly fragmented market and we are a leading distributor of automotive parts and other products to local regional and national repair garages dealers service stations and public sector accounts in the Americas As a part of the domestic store program we offer credit and delivery to our customers as well as online ordering through wwwautozoneprocom Through our hub stores we offer a greater range of parts and products desired by professional technicians We have dedicated sales teams focused on independent repair shops as well as national regional and public sector commercial accounts Store Operations Store Formats Substantially all stores are based on standard store formats resulting in generally consistent appearance merchandising and product mix Approximately 90 to 99 of each stores square footage is selling space In our satellite stores approximately 40 to 50 of our space is dedicated to hard parts inventory while our hub stores and mega hubs have 70 to 85 of their space utilized for hard parts The hard parts inventory area is generally fronted by counters or pods that run the depth or length of the store dividing the hard parts area from the remainder of the store The remaining selling space contains displays of maintenance accessories and nonautomotive items We believe that our stores are destination stores generating their own traffic rather than relying on traffic created by adjacent stores Therefore we situate most stores on major thoroughfares with easy access and good parking 7   Store Personnel and Training We provide onthejob training as well as formal training programs including an annual national sales meeting with related cascading meetings at our distribution centers regional offices and stores store meetings on specific sales and product topics standardized computerbased training to support culture safety salesmanship compliance and product and job knowledge and several specialist vendor and thirdparty programs to support learning and development in areas requiring technical expertise and specific job knowledge All domestic AutoZoners are encouraged to complete our inhouse product knowledge program and Parts Expert certification which is developed in partnership with our key suppliers Training is supplemented with frequent store visits by management Advanced leadership training is an additional area of investment that is used to deepen bench strength and support succession planning Store managers commercial sales managers and managers at various levels across the organization receive financial incentives through performancebased bonuses In addition our growth has provided opportunities for the promotion of qualified AutoZoners We believe these opportunities are important to attract motivate and retain high quality AutoZoners All store support functions are centralized in our store support centers located in Memphis Tennessee Monterrey Mexico Chihuahua Mexico and Sao Paulo Brazil We believe that this centralization enhances consistent execution of our merchandising and marketing strategies at the store level while reducing expenses and cost of sales Store Automation All of our stores have Znet our proprietary electronic catalog that enables our AutoZoners to efficiently look up the parts that our customers need and to provide complete job solutions advice and information for customer vehicles Znet provides parts information based on the year make model and engine type of a vehicle and also tracks inventory availability at the store at other nearby stores and through special order The Znet display screens are placed on the hard parts counter or pods where both the AutoZoner and customer can view the screen Our stores utilize our computerized proprietary PointofSale System which includes bar code scanning and pointofsale data collection terminals Our proprietary Store Management System provides administrative assistance as well as enhanced merchandising information and improved inventory control We believe the PointofSale System also enhances customer service through faster processing of transactions while the Store Management System provides simplified warranty and product return procedures Store Development The following table reflects our location development during the past five fiscal years              Fiscal Year  2020 2019 2018 2017 2016 Locations Beginning 6411 6202 6029 5814 5609 Sold 1   26   New 138 209 201 215 205 Closed   2   Net new

believe expansion opportunities exist in markets we do not currently serve as well as in markets where we can achieve a larger presence We undertake substantial research prior to entering new markets The most important criteria for opening a new store are the projected future profitability and the ability to achieve our required investment hurdle rate Key factors in selecting new site and market locations for stores include population demographics vehicle profile customer buying trends commercial businesses number and strength of competitors stores and the cost of real estate In reviewing the vehicle profile we also consider the number of vehicles that are seven years old and older or our kind of vehicles these vehicles are generally no longer under the original manufacturers warranties and require more maintenance and repair than newer vehicles We seek to open new stores in high visibility sites in high traffic locations within or contiguous to existing market areas and attempt to cluster development in markets in a relatively short period of time In addition to continuing to lease or develop our own locations we evaluate and may make strategic acquisitions Purchasing and Supply Chain Merchandise is selected and purchased for all stores through our store support centers located in Memphis Tennessee Monterrey Mexico and Sao Paulo Brazil Additionally we have an office in Shanghai China to support our sourcing efforts in Asia In fiscal 2020 one class of similar products accounted for approximately 12 percent of our total sales and one vendor supplied approximately 12 percent of our purchases No other class of similar products accounted for 10 percent or more of our total sales and no other individual vendor provided more than 10 percent of our total purchases We believe that alternative sources of supply exist at similar costs for most types of product sold Most of our merchandise flows through our distribution centers to our stores by our fleet of tractors and trailers or by thirdparty trucking firms The distribution centers replenish all stores up to multiple times per week depending on store sales volumes We ended fiscal 2020 with 224 total domestic hub stores which have a larger assortment of products as well as regular replenishment items that can be delivered to a store in its network within 24 hours Hub stores are generally replenished from distribution centers multiple times per week Hub stores have increased our ability to distribute products on a timely basis to many of our stores and to expand our product assortment As a subset of our domestic hub stores we ended fiscal 2020 with 44 domestic mega hubs an increase of 9 since the end of fiscal 2019 Mega hubs work in concert with our hubs to drive customer satisfaction through improved local parts availability and expanded product assortments A mega hub store carries inventory of 70000 to 110000 unique SKUs approximately twice what a hub store carries Mega hubs provide coverage to both surrounding stores and other hub stores multiple times a day or on an overnight basis Currently we have over 5700 domestic stores with access to mega hub inventory A majority of these 5700 stores currently receive their service same day Competition The sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive due to numerous factors including name recognition product availability customer service store location and price AutoZone competes in the aftermarket auto parts industry which includes both the retail DIY and commercial doitforme DIFM auto parts and

aftermarket vehicle parts and supplies chemicals accessories tools and maintenance parts AutoZone competes on the basis of customer service including the knowledge and expertise of our AutoZoners

components of our marketing and merchandising strategies Employees As of August 29 2020 we employed approximately 100000 persons approximately 60 percent of whom were employed fulltime About 91 percent of our AutoZoners were employed in stores or in direct field supervision approximately 6 percent in distribution centers and approximately 3 percent in store support and other functions Included in the above numbers are approximately 10000 persons employed in our Mexico and Brazil operations We have never experienced any material labor disruption and believe that relations with our AutoZoners are good Seasonality Our business is somewhat seasonal in nature with the highest sales typically occurring in the spring and summer months of February through September in which average weekly perstore sales historically have been about 10 to 25 higher than in the slower months of December and January During short periods of time a stores sales can be affected by weather conditions Extremely hot or extremely cold weather may enhance sales by causing parts to fail thereby increasing sales of seasonal products Mild or rainy weather tends to soften sales as parts failure rates are lower in mild weather and elective maintenance is deferred during periods of rainy weather Over the longer term we believe the effects of weather balance out as we have locations throughout the

PLC   Item 1A Risk Factors Our business is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties The risks and uncertainties described below could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition operating results cash flows and stock price The following information should be read in conjunction with the other information contained in this report and other filings that we make with the SEC These risks and uncertainties are not the only ones we face Our business could also be affected by additional factors that are presently unknown to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial to our business The ongoing outbreak of COVID19 has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization continues to spread within the United States and many other parts of the world and may have a material adverse effect on our business operations financial condition liquidity and cash flow As the outbreak of COVID19 continues to grow both in the US and globally there has been significant volatility in financial market indices and the adoption of emergency legislation aimed to address the negative impacts of the pandemic While sales were initially negatively impacted and we have incurred significant expenses following the US federal government stimulus our sales rebounded reaching record levels We are unable to accurately predict the impact that COVID19 will have on our business and financial condition due to numerous uncertainties including the severity of the disease the duration of the outbreak the likelihood of a resurgence of the outbreak actions that may be taken by governmental authorities in response to the disease and unintended consequences of the foregoing In particular it is unclear what nearterm and longterm impact these factors will have on the number of vehicle miles driven traffic to our stores as well as demand for our products from our retail and commercial customers Continued business disruption caused by COVID19 may require significant actions to mitigate the impact including but not limited to employee furloughs reductions in store hours and store closings as well as ongoing increases in expenses Further the continuing pandemic and related economic uncertainty may result in prolonged disruption to our business additional negative impacts of which we are not currently aware and may also magnify other risks associated with our business and operations including risks associated with sourcing quality merchandise domestically and outside the US our ability to promptly adjust inventory levels to meet fluctuations in customer demand our ability to comply with complex and evolving laws and regulations related to customers and AutoZoners health and safety our ability to open new store locations and expand or remodel existing stores and our ability to hire and train qualified employees to address temporary or sustained labor shortages Accordingly the COVID19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products workforce availability and our results of operations financial condition liquidity and cash flows  If demand for our products slows then our business may be materially adversely affected Demand for the products we sell may be affected by a number of factors we cannot control including  the number of older vehicles in service Vehicles seven years old or older are generally no longer under the original vehicle manufacturers warranties and tend to need more maintenance and repair than newer vehicles   rising energy prices Increases in energy prices may cause our customers to defer purchases of certain of our products as they use a higher percentage of their income to pay for gasoline and other energy costs and may drive their vehicles less resulting in less wear and tear and lower demand for repairs and maintenance 13    the economy In periods of declining economic conditions consumers may reduce their discretionary spending by deferring vehicle maintenance or repair Additionally such conditions may affect our customers ability to obtain credit During periods of expansionary economic conditions more of our DIY customers may pay others to repair and maintain their vehicles instead of working on their own vehicles or they may purchase new vehicles  the weather Milder weather conditions may lower the failure rates of automotive parts while extended periods of rain and winter precipitation may cause our customers to defer maintenance and repair on their vehicles Extremely hot or cold conditions may enhance demand for our products due to increased failure rates of our customers automotive parts  technological advances Advances in automotive technology such as electric vehicles and parts design can result in cars needing maintenance less frequently and parts lasting longer  the number of miles vehicles are driven annually Higher vehicle mileage increases the need for maintenance and repair Mileage levels may be affected by gas prices ride sharing and other factors  the quality of the vehicles manufactured by the original vehicle manufacturers and the length of the warranties or maintenance offered on new vehicles  restrictions on access to telematics and diagnostic tools and repair information imposed by the original vehicle manufacturers or by governmental regulation These restrictions may cause vehicle owners to rely on dealers to perform maintenance and repairs  These factors could result in a decline in the demand for our products which could adversely affect our business and overall financial condition  If we are unable to compete successfully against other businesses that sell the products that we sell we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline The sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive and sales volumes are dependent on many factors including name recognition product availability customer service store location and price Competitors are opening locations near our existing locations AutoZone competes as a provider in both the DIY and DIFM auto parts and accessories markets Our competitors include national regional and local auto parts chains independently owned parts stores online automotive parts stores or marketplaces wholesale distributors jobbers repair shops car washes and auto dealers in addition to discount and mass merchandise stores hardware stores supermarkets drugstores convenience stores home stores and other retailers that sell aftermarket vehicle parts and supplies chemicals accessories tools and maintenance parts Although we believe we compete effectively on the basis of customer service including the knowledge and expertise of our AutoZoners merchandise quality selection and availability product warranty store layout location and convenience price and the strength of our AutoZone brand name trademarks and service marks some of our competitors may gain competitive advantages such as greater financial and marketing resources allowing them to sell automotive products at lower prices larger stores with more merchandise longer operating histories more frequent customer visits and more effective advertising Online and multichannel retailers often focus on delivery services offering customers faster guaranteed delivery times and lowprice or free shipping Some online businesses have lower operating costs than we do In addition because our business strategy is based on offering superior levels of customer service to complement the products we offer our cost structure is higher than some of our competitors which also puts pressure on our margins Consumers are embracing shopping online and through mobile commerce applications With the increasing use of digital tools and social media and our competitors increased focus on optimizing customers online experience our customers are quickly able to compare prices product assortment and feedback from other customers before purchasing our products either online in the physical stores or through a combination of both offerings 14   We believe that we compete effectively on the basis of merchandise availability as a result of investments in inventory available for immediate sale the development of a robust hub and mega hub distribution network providing efficient access to obtain products required ondemand options to order products online or by telephone and pick them up in stores and options for special orders directly from our vendors We also offer hasslefree returns to our customers In addition we believe that customers value the personal interaction with a salesperson that is qualified to offer trustworthy advice and provide other free services such as parts testing  We also utilize promotions advertising and our loyalty programs to drive customer traffic and compete more effectively and we must regularly assess and adjust our efforts to address changes in the competitive marketplace If we are unable to continue to manage readilyavailable inventory demand and competitive delivery options as well as develop successful competitive strategies including the maintenance of effective promotions advertising and loyalty programs or if our competitors develop more effective strategies we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline  We may not be able to sustain our historic rate of sales growth  We have increased our store count in the past five fiscal years growing from 5609 stores at August 29 2015 to 6549 stores at August 29 2020 an average store increase per year of three percent Additionally we have increased annual revenues in the past five fiscal years from 10187 billion in fiscal 2015 to 12632 billion in fiscal 2020 an average increase per year of five percent Annual revenue growth is driven by the opening of new stores the development of new commercial programs and increases in same store sales We open new stores only after evaluating customer buying trends and market demandneeds all of which could be adversely affected by persistent unemployment wage cuts small business failures and microeconomic conditions unique to the automotive industry Same store sales are impacted both by customer demand levels and by the prices we are able to charge for our products which can also be negatively impacted by economic pressures We cannot provide any assurance that we will continue to open stores at historical rates or continue to achieve increases in same store sales  Consolidation among our competitors may negatively impact our business Historically some of our competitors have merged Consolidation among our competitors could enhance their market share and financial position provide them with the ability to achieve better purchasing terms and provide more competitive prices to customers for whom we compete and allow them to utilize merger synergies and cost savings to increase advertising and marketing budgets to more effectively compete for customers Consolidation by our competitors could also increase their access to local market parts assortment These consolidated competitors could take sales volume away from us in certain markets could achieve greater market penetration could cause us to change our pricing with a negative impact on our margins or could cause us to spend more money to maintain customers or seek new customers all of which could negatively impact our business  If we cannot profitably increase our market share in the commercial auto parts business our sales growth may be limited Although we are one of the largest sellers of auto parts in the commercial market we must effectively compete against national and regional auto parts chains independently owned parts stores wholesalers and jobbers in order to increase our commercial market share Although we believe we compete effectively in the commercial market on the basis of customer service merchandise quality selection and availability price product warranty distribution locations and the strength of our AutoZone brand name trademarks and service marks some automotive aftermarket participants have been in business for substantially longer periods of time than we have and as a result have developed longterm customer relationships and have large available inventories If we are unable to profitably develop new commercial customers our sales growth may be limited      15   Our business depends upon hiring training and retaining qualified employees We believe that much of our brand value lies in the quality of the approximately 100000 AutoZoners employed in our stores distribution centers store support centers and ALLDATA Our workforce costs represent our largest operating expense and our business is subject to employment laws and regulations including requirements related to minimum wage benefits and scheduling requirements In addition the implementation of potential regulatory changes relating to overtime exemptions and benefits for certain employees under federal and state laws could result in increased labor costs to our business and negatively impact our operating results We cannot be assured that we can continue to hire train and retain qualified employees at current wage rates since we operate in a competitive labor market and there is a risk of market increases in compensation  If we are unable to hire properly train and retain qualified employees we could experience higher employment costs reduced sales regulatory noncompliance losses of customers and diminution of our brand or company culture which could adversely affect our earnings If we do not maintain competitive wages or benefit packages our customer service could suffer due to a declining quality of our workforce or alternatively our earnings could decrease if we increase our wage rates A violation or change in employment and labor laws including changes in existing employment benefit programs such as health insurance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows  Inability to acquire and provide quality merchandise at competitive prices could adversely affect our sales and results of operations  We are dependent upon our domestic and international vendors continuing to supply us with quality merchandise at competitive prices and payment terms If our merchandise offerings do not meet our customers expectations regarding quality and safety we could experience lost sales increased costs and exposure to legal and reputational risk All of our vendors must comply with applicable product safety laws and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety and quality standards Events that give rise to actual potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to government enforcement action or private litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities To the extent our suppliers are subject to added government regulation of their product design andor manufacturing processes the cost of the merchandise we purchase may rise In addition negative customer perceptions regarding the safety or quality of the products we sell could cause our customers to seek alternative sources for their needs resulting in lost sales In those circumstances it may be difficult and costly for us to rebuild our reputation and regain the confidence of our customers Moreover our vendors are impacted by global economic conditions Credit market and other macroeconomic conditions including disruption to the global supply chain could have a material adverse effect on the ability of our suppliers to finance and operate their businesses resulting in increased product costs and difficulties in meeting our inventory demands If we experience transitions or changeover with any of our significant vendors or if they experience financial difficulties or otherwise are unable to deliver merchandise to us on a timely basis or at all we could have product shortages in our stores that could adversely affect customers perceptions of us and cause us to lose customers and sales   16   Risks associated with products sourced outside the US We directly imported approximately 13 of our purchases in fiscal 2020 but many of our domestic vendors directly import their products or components of their products Changes to the price or flow of these goods for any reason such as civil unrest or acts of war currency fluctuations disruptions in maritime lanes port labor disputes and economic conditions and instability in the countries in which foreign suppliers are located the financial instability of suppliers failure to meet our standards issues with labor practices of our suppliers or labor problems they may experience such as strikes stoppages or slowdowns which could also increase labor costs during and following the disruption the availability and cost of raw materials to suppliers increased import duties or tariffs merchandise quality or safety issues transport availability and cost increases in wage rates and taxes transport security inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located or from which they import often are beyond our control and could adversely affect our operations and profitability In addition the foreign trade policies tariffs and other impositions on imported goods trade sanctions imposed on certain countries import limitations on certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade and port labor agreements are beyond our control These and other factors such as the COVID19 pandemic affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our business and financial performance As we or our domestic vendors increase our imports of merchandise from foreign vendors the risks associated with these imports will also increase Our ability to grow depends in part on new location openings existing location remodels and expansions and effective utilization of our existing supply chain and hub network Our continued growth and success will depend in part on our ability to open and operate new locations and expand and remodel existing locations to meet customers needs on a timely and profitable basis Accomplishing our new and existing location expansion goals will depend upon a number of factors including the ability to partner with developers and landlords to obtain suitable sites for new and expanded locations at acceptable costs the hiring and training of qualified personnel and the integration of new locations into existing operations There can be no assurance we will be able to achieve our location expansion goals manage our growth effectively successfully integrate the planned new locations into our operations or operate our new remodeled and expanded locations profitably In addition we extensively utilize our hub network our supply chain and logistics management techniques to efficiently stock our locations We have made and plan to continue to make significant investments in our supply chain to improve our ability to provide the best parts at the right price and to meet consumer product needs If we fail to effectively utilize our existing hubs andor supply chains or if our investments in our supply chain initiatives including directly sourcing some products from outside the US do not provide the anticipated benefits we could experience suboptimal inventory levels in our locations or increases in our operating costs which could adversely affect our sales volume andor our margins Our failure to protect our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our brand name and profitability We believe our continued strong sales growth is driven in significant part by our brand name The value in our brand name and its continued effectiveness in driving our sales growth are dependent to a significant degree on our ability to maintain our reputation for safety high product quality friendliness service trustworthy advice integrity and business ethics Any negative publicity about these areas could damage our reputation and may result in reduced demand for our merchandise The increasing use of technology also poses a risk as customers are able to quickly compare products and prices and use social media to provide feedback in a manner that is rapidly and broadly dispersed Our reputation could be impacted if customers have a bad experience and share it over social media 17   Failure to comply with ethical social product labor environmental and anticorruption standards could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse actions by consumer or environmental groups employees or regulatory bodies Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations to maintain an effective system of internal controls or to provide accurate and timely financial statement information could also hurt our reputation If we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions while incurring substantial legal fees and costs In addition our capital and operating expenses could increase due to implementation of and compliance with existing and future laws and regulations or remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any existing or future laws or regulations The inability to pass through any increased expenses through higher prices would have an adverse effect on our results of operations Damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation Our success in international operations is dependent on our ability to manage the unique challenges presented by international markets  The various risks we face in our US operations generally also exist when conducting operations in and sourcing products and materials from outside of the US in addition to the unique costs risks and difficulties of managing international operations Our expansion into international markets may be adversely affected by local laws and customs US laws applicable to foreign operations and political and socioeconomic conditions  Risks inherent in international operations also include potential adverse tax consequences potential changes to trade policies and trade agreements compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local antibribery and anticorruption laws greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights challenges to identify and gain access to local suppliers and possibly misjudging the response of consumers in foreign countries to our product assortment and marketing strategy  In addition our operations in international markets are conducted primarily in the local currency of those countries Since our Consolidated Financial Statements are denominated in US dollars amounts of assets liabilities net sales and other revenues and expenses denominated in local currencies must be translated into US dollars using exchange rates for the current period As a result foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may adversely impact our financial performance                   18   Failure to protect or effectively respond to a breach of the privacy and security of customers suppliers AutoZoners or Company information could damage our reputation subject us to litigation and cause us to incur substantial costs  Our business like that of most retailers and distributors involves the receipt storage and transmission of personal information about our customers suppliers and AutoZoners some of which is entrusted to thirdparty service providers and vendors Failure to protect the security of our customers suppliers employees and Company information could subject us to costly regulatory enforcement actions expose us to litigation and impair our reputation which may have a negative impact on our sales We consider information security to be a top priority and undertake cybersecurity planning and activities throughout the Company Senior management and the Board of Directors are actively engaged in cybersecurity risk management While we and our thirdparty service providers and vendors take significant steps to protect customer supplier employee and other confidential information including maintaining compliance with payment card industry standards and a security program that includes updating technology and security policies employee training and monitoring and routine testing of our systems these security measures may be breached in the future due to cyberattack employee error system compromises fraud trickery hacking or other intentional or unintentional acts and unauthorized parties may obtain access to this data We believe that our preventative actions provide adequate measures of protection against security breaches and generally reduce our cybersecurity risks However our business or our third party providers with which we share sensitive information may not discover a security breach or loss of information for a significant period after the security breach occurs Failure to effectively respond to system compromises may undermine our security measures The methods used to obtain unauthorized access are constantly evolving and may be difficult to anticipate or detect for long periods of time To date we have not experienced a material breach of cybersecurity however our computer systems have been and will likely continue to be subjected to unauthorized access or phishing attempts computer viruses malware ransomware or other malicious codes As the regulatory environment related to information security data collection and use and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous compliance with these requirements could also result in significant additional costs There can be no assurance that our security measures will prevent or limit the impact of a future incident The cost to remediate damages to our systems suffered as a result of a cyberattack could be significant  We accept payments using a variety of methods including cash checks credit debit electronic payments such as PayPal Apple Pay etc and gift cards and we may offer new payment options over time which may have information security risk implications As a retailer accepting debit and credit cards for payment we are subject to various industry data protection standards and protocols such as the American National Standards Institute encryption standards and payment network security operating guidelines and Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard Even though we comply with these standards and protocols and other information security measures we cannot be certain that the security measures we maintain to protect all of our information technology systems are able to prevent contain or detect any cyberattacks cyber terrorism or security breaches from known cyberattacks or malware that may be developed in the future We maintain insurance coverage that may protect us from certain cyberattack claims however our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover significant losses in any particular situation To the extent that any cyberattack or intrusion in our or one of our thirdparty service providers information systems results in the loss damage or misappropriation of information we may be materially adversely affected by claims from customers financial institutions regulatory authorities payment card networks and others In certain circumstances payment card association rules and obligations to which we are subject under our contracts with payment card processors make us liable to payment card issuers if information in connection with payment cards and payment card transactions that we hold is compromised which liabilities could be substantial In addition the cost of complying with stricter and more complex data privacy data collection and information security laws and standards could be significant to us  We have invested in informationtechnology risk management and disaster recovery plans Although these plans are in place we must provide ongoing monitoring and consistently revise our plans as technologies change rapidly and our efforts to overcome security risks continue to become increasingly more complex and concentrated  19   We rely heavily on our information technology systems for our key business processes Any failure or interruption in these systems could have a material adverse impact on our business  We rely extensively on our information technology systems some of which are managed or provided by thirdparty service providers to manage inventory communicate with customers process transactions and summarize results Our systems and the thirdparty systems we rely on are subject to damage or interruption from power outages facility damage physical theft telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches malicious cyberattacks catastrophic events and design or usage errors by our AutoZoners contractors or thirdparty service providers Although we and our thirdparty service providers work diligently to maintain our respective systems we may not be successful in doing so If our systems are damaged or fail to function properly we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them and may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process transactions which could result in lost sales inability to process purchase orders andor a potential loss of customer loyalty which could adversely affect our results of operations We are in the process of developing and implementing various information systems as well as modifying existing systems These technological changes will require significant investment of human and financial resources and we may experience significant delays costs increases and other obstacles with these projects Although we have invested significant resources during our planning project management and training implementation issues may arise which may disrupt our operations and negatively impact our business operations financial condition and cash flows Business interruptions may negatively impact our location hours operability of our computer and other systems availability of merchandise and otherwise have a material negative effect on our sales and our business War or acts of terrorism political or civil unrest unusual weather conditions hurricanes tornadoes windstorms fires earthquakes floods global health epidemics such as COVID19 and other natural or other disasters or the threat of any of them may result in certain of our locations being closed for a period of time or permanently or have a negative impact on our ability to obtain merchandise available for sale in our locations Some of our merchandise is imported from other countries If imported goods become difficult or impossible to bring into the US and if we cannot obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar costs our sales and profit margins may be negatively affected In the event that commercial transportation is curtailed or substantially delayed our business may be adversely impacted as we may have difficulty transporting merchandise to our distribution centers and locations resulting in lost sales andor a potential loss of customer loyalty Transportation issues could also cause us to cancel purchase orders if we are unable to receive merchandise in our distribution centers We are selfinsured for certain costs associated with our operations and an increase in our insurance claims and expenses may have a material negative impact on us We are selfinsured up to certain limits for workers compensation employee group medical general liability product liability property and automobile The types and amounts of insurance may vary from time to time based on our decisions with respect to risk retention and regulatory requirements Our reserves are established using historical trends and where appropriate using a third party actuary to estimate costs to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported Estimated costs are subject to a variety of assumptions and other factors including the severity duration and frequency of claims legal costs associated with claims healthcare trends and projected inflation of related factors Material increases in the number of insurance claims changes to healthcare costs accident frequency and severity legal expenses and other factors could result in unfavorable difference between actual selfinsurance costs and our reserve estimates As a result our selfinsurance costs could increase which may adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows  20   General Risk Factors  A downgrade in our credit ratings or a general disruption in the credit markets could make it more difficult for us to access funds refinance our debt obtain new funding or issue debt securities Our shortterm and longterm debt is rated investment grade by the major rating agencies These investmentgrade credit ratings have historically allowed us to take advantage of lower interest rates and other favorable terms on our shortterm credit lines in our senior debt offerings and in the commercial paper markets To maintain our investmentgrade ratings we are required to meet certain financial performance ratios A change by the rating agencies in these ratios an increase in our debt andor a decline in our earnings could result in downgrades in our credit ratings A downgrade in our credit ratings could limit our access to public debt markets limit the institutions willing to provide credit facilities to us result in more restrictive financial and other covenants in our public and private debt and would likely significantly increase our overall borrowing costs and adversely affect our earnings  Moreover significant deterioration in the financial condition of large financial institutions during the Great Recession resulted in a severe loss of liquidity and availability of credit in global credit markets and in more stringent borrowing terms We can provide no assurance that such similar events that occurred during the Great Recession will not occur again in the foreseeable future Conditions and events in the global credit markets could have a material adverse effect on our access to shortterm and longterm debt and the terms and cost of that debt  Our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected by the adoption of new laws changes to existing laws increased enforcement activity or other governmental actions  We are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations many of which are complex frequently revised and subject to varying interpretations These include laws governing employment and labor wage and hour environmental matters proper handling and disposal of hazardous materials and waste healthcare data privacy cybersecurity the pricing and sale of goods import and export compliance and transportation and logistics among others These laws may differ substantially in the areas where we operate Although we have implemented policies and procedures to help ensure compliance with these laws there can be no certainty that our employees and third parties with whom we do business will not take actions in violation of our policies or applicable laws If we fail to comply with these laws rules and regulations or the manner in which they are interpreted or applied we may be subject to governmental enforcement action or private litigation resulting in monetary penalties reputational harm and increased costs of regulatory compliance Any changes in regulations the imposition of additional regulations or the enactment of any new legislation could have an adverse impact directly or indirectly on our financial condition and results of operations We may also be subject to investigations or audits by governmental authorities and regulatory agencies as a result of enforcing existing laws and regulations or changes in enforcement priorities which can occur in the ordinary course of business or may result from increased scrutiny from a particular agency or toward a particular industry  Our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows may be affected by litigation  We are involved in lawsuits regulatory investigations governmental and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of business Such matters involve significant expense and divert managements attention and resources from other matters The damages sought against us in these proceedings may be material and may adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows          21   Significant changes in macroeconomic and geopolitical factors could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations  Macroeconomic conditions impact both our customers and our suppliers Job growth in the US was stagnated and unemployment was at historically high levels during the Great Recession While in recent years the unemployment rate has improved to below prerecession levels unemployment has again reached historically high levels due to COVID19 Moreover the US government continues to operate under historically large deficits and debt burden Continued distress in global credit markets business failures inflation foreign exchange rate fluctuations significant geopolitical conflicts proposed or additional tariffs continued volatility in energy prices the impact of a public health crisis or pandemic such as COVID19 and other factors continue to affect the global economy Moreover rising energy prices could impact our merchandise distribution commercial delivery utility and product costs It is unclear how such factors could impact our business in the short term Over a longer period of time these macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions could adversely affect our sales growth margins and overhead These could adversely affect our financial condition and operations Item 1B Unresolved Staff Comments None   22   Item 2 Properties The following table reflects the square footage and number of leased and owned properties for our stores as of August 29 2020       No of Store Square   Stores  Footage Leased 3489 22811306 Owned 3060 20690477 Total 6549 43501783  We have approximately 59 million square feet in distribution centers servicing our stores of which approximately 19 million square feet is leased and the remainder is owned Our 12 distribution centers are located in Arizona California Florida Georgia Illinois Ohio Pennsylvania Tennessee Texas Washington and two in Mexico Our primary store support center is located in Memphis Tennessee and consists of approximately 320000 square feet We also have three additional store support centers located in Monterrey Mexico Chihuahua Mexico and Sao Paulo Brazil Our International Sourcing Office is located in Shanghai China The ALLDATA headquarters in Elk Grove California is leased and we also own or lease other properties that are not material in the aggregate Item 3 Legal Proceedings In 2004 we acquired a store site in Mount Ephraim New Jersey that had previously been the site of a gasoline service station and contained evidence of groundwater contamination Upon acquisition we voluntarily reported the groundwater contamination issue to the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection NJDEP and entered into a Voluntary Remediation Agreement providing for the remediation of the contamination associated with the property We have conducted and paid for at an immaterial cost to us remediation of contamination on the property We have also voluntarily investigated and addressed potential vapor intrusion impacts in downgradient residences and businesses The NJDEP has asserted in a Directive and Notice to Insurers dated February 19 2013 and again in an Amended Directive and Notice to Insurers dated January 13 2014 collectively the Directives that we are liable for the downgradient impacts under a joint and severable liability theory By letter dated April 23 2015 NJDEP has demanded payment from us and other parties in the amount of approximately 296 thousand for costs incurred by NJDEP in connection with contamination downgradient of the property By letter dated January 29 2016 we were informed that NJDEP has filed a lien against the property in connection with approximately 355 thousand in costs incurred by NJDEP in connection with contamination downgradient of the property We have contested and will continue to contest any such assertions due to the existence of other entitiessources of contamination some of which are named in the Directives and the April 23 2015 demand letter in the area of the property Pursuant to the Voluntary Remediation Agreement upon completion of all remediation required by the agreement we believe we should be eligible to be reimbursed up to 75 of qualified remediation costs by the State of New Jersey We have asked the state for clarification that the agreement applies to offsite work Although the aggregate amount of additional costs that we may incur pursuant to the remediation cannot currently be ascertained we do not currently believe that fulfillment of our obligations under the agreement or otherwise will result in costs that are material to our financial condition results of operations or cash flows We are involved in various other legal proceedings incidental to the conduct of our business including but not limited to several lawsuits containing classaction allegations in which the plaintiffs are current and former hourly and salaried employees who allege various wage and hour violations and unlawful termination practices We do not currently believe that either individually or in the aggregate these matters will result in liabilities material to our financial condition results of operations or cash flows Item 4 Mine Safety Disclosures Not applicable 23   PART II
