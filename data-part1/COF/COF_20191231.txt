we launched a new credit card issuance program with Walmart Inc Walmart and are now the exclusive issuer of Walmarts cobrand and private label credit card program in the US On October 11 2019 we completed the acquisition of the existing portfolio of Walmarts cobrand and private label credit card receivables Walmart acquisition As of the acquisition date we added approximately 81 billion to our domestic credit card loans held for investment portfolio In the second quarter of 2019 we made the decision to exit several small partnership portfolios in our Credit Card business We sold approximately 900 million of receivables and transferred approximately 100 million to loans held for sale as of June 30 2019 which resulted in a gain on sale of 49 million recognized in other noninterest income and an allowance release of 68 million 4 Capital One Financial Corporation COF Table of Contents Cybersecurity Incident On July 29 2019 we announced there was unauthorized access by an outside individual who obtained certain types of personal information relating to people who had applied for our credit card products and to our credit card customers the Cybersecurity Incident The Cybersecurity Incident occurred on March 22 and 23 2019 We believe the individual was able to exploit a specific configuration vulnerability in our infrastructure We immediately fixed the configuration vulnerability that this individual exploited and verified there are no other instances in our environment The person responsible was arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation on July 29 2019 and federal prosecution of the responsible person has commenced The US Attorneys Office has stated they believe the data has been recovered and that there is no evidence the data was used for fraud or shared by this individual This event affected approximately 100 million individuals in the United States and approximately 6 million in Canada We believe no credit card account numbers or login credentials were compromised The largest category of information accessed was information on consumers and small businesses as of the time they applied for one of our credit card products from 2005 through early 2019 This information included personal information that we routinely collect at the time we receive credit card applications including names addresses zip codespostal codes phone numbers email addresses dates of birth and selfreported income In addition to credit card application data the individual also obtained portions of credit card customer data including customer status data eg credit scores credit limits balances payment history contact information and fragments of transaction data from a total of 23 days during 2016 2017 and 2018 Approximately 120000 Social Security numbers of our credit card customers and approximately 80000 linked bank account numbers of our secured credit card customers were compromised in this incident For our Canadian credit card customers approximately 1 million Social Insurance Numbers were compromised in this incident We provided required notification to affected individuals and made free credit monitoring and identity protection available We retained a leading independent cybersecurity firm that confirmed we correctly identified and fixed the specific configuration vulnerability exploited in the Cybersecurity Incident During the year we incurred 72 million of incremental expenses related to the remediation of and response to the Cybersecurity Incident largely driven by customer notifications credit monitoring technology costs and professional support offset by 34 million of insurance recoveries pursuant to our insurance coverage described below These amounts were treated as adjusting items as it relates to our financial results Cyber Adjusting Items We expect to be at the low end of the 100 million to 150 million range previously disclosed for the total amount of Cyber Adjusting Items and expect that some of these costs will extend beyond 2019 We carry insurance to cover certain costs associated with a cyber risk event This insurance has a total coverage limit of 400 million and is subject to a 10 million deductible which was met in the third quarter of 2019 as well as standard exclusions We continue to expect that a significant portion of the Cyber Adjusting Items will be covered by insurance Insurance reimbursements will also be treated as adjusting items and the timing of recognizing insurance reimbursements may differ from the timing of recognizing the associated expenses We continue to invest significantly in cybersecurity and expect to make additional investments as we continue to assess our cybersecurity program These estimated investments are in addition to the estimated Cyber Adjusting Items and we expect to absorb them within our existing operating efficiency ratio guidance Although the ultimate magnitude and timing of expenses or other impacts to our business or reputation related to the Cybersecurity Incident are uncertain they may be significant and some of the costs may not be covered by insurance However we do not believe that this incident will negatively impact our strategy or our longterm financial health For more information see  Note 18Commitments Contingencies Guarantees and Others  Our reported results excluding adjusting items including the Cyber Adjusting Items and our existing operating efficiency ratio guidance represent nonGAAP measures which we believe help users of our financial information understand the impact of these adjusting items on our reported results as well as provide an alternate measurement of our operating performance 5 Capital One Financial Corporation COF Table of Contents Additional

SEGMENTS Our consolidated total net revenues are derived primarily from lending to consumer and commercial customers net of funding costs associated with our deposits longterm debt and other borrowings We also earn noninterest income which primarily consists of interchange income net of reward expenses service charges and other customerrelated fees Our expenses primarily consist of the provision for credit losses operating expenses marketing expenses and income taxes Our principal operations are organized for management reporting purposes into three major business segments which are defined primarily based on the products and services provided or the types of customers served Credit Card Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking The operations of acquired businesses have been integrated into our existing business segments Certain activities that are not part of a segment such as management of our corporate investment portfolio assetliability management by our centralized Corporate Treasury group and residual tax expense or benefit to arrive at the consolidated effective tax rate that is not assessed to our primary business segments  are included in the Other category  Credit Card Consists of our domestic consumer and small business card lending and international card businesses in Canada and the United Kingdom  Consumer Banking Consists of our deposit gathering and lending activities for consumers and small businesses and national auto lending  Commercial Banking Consists of our lending deposit gathering capital markets and treasury management services to commercial real estate and commercial and industrial customers Our commercial and industrial customers typically include companies with annual revenues between 20 million and 2 billion Customer usage and payment patterns credit quality levels of marketing expense and operating efficiency all affect our profitability In our Credit Card business we experience fluctuations in purchase volume and the level of outstanding loan receivables due to seasonal variances in consumer spending and payment patterns which for example are highest around the winter holiday season Net chargeoff rates for our credit card loan portfolio also have historically exhibited seasonal patterns as well and generally tend to be the highest in the first quarter of the year No individual quarter in 2019 2018 or 2017 accounted for more than 30 of our total revenues in any of these fiscal years For additional information on our business segments including the financial performance of each business see  Part II  Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations MDA  Executive Summary and Business Outlook  MDA Business Segment Financial Performance  and  Note 17Business Segments and Revenue from Contracts with Customers  of this Report 6 Capital One Financial Corporation COF Table of Contents COMPETITION Each of our business segments operates in a highly competitive environment and we face competition in all aspects of our business from numerous bank and nonbank providers of financial services Our Credit Card business competes with international national regional and local issuers of Visa and MasterCard credit cards as well as with American Express   Discover Card   privatelabel card brands and to a certain extent issuers of debit cards In general customers are attracted to credit card issuers largely on the basis of price credit limit reward programs and other product features Our Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking businesses compete with national state and direct banks for deposits commercial and auto loans as well as with savings and loan associations and credit unions for loans and deposits Our competitors also include automotive finance companies commercial mortgage banking companies and other financial services providers that provide loans deposits and other similar services and products In addition we compete against nondepository institutions that are able to offer these products and services Securities firms and insurance companies that elect to become financial holding companies may acquire banks and other financial institutions Combinations of this type could significantly change the competitive environment in which we conduct business The financial services industry is also likely to become more competitive as further technological advances enable more companies to provide financial services These technological advances may diminish the importance of depository institutions and other financial intermediaries in the transfer of funds between parties In addition competition among direct banks is intense because online banking provides customers the ability to rapidly deposit and withdraw funds and open and close accounts in favor of products and services offered by competitors Our businesses generally compete on the basis of the quality and range of their products and services transaction execution innovation and price Competition varies based on the types of clients customers industries and geographies served Our ability to compete depends in part on our ability to attract and retain our associates and on our reputation There can be no assurance however that our ability to market products and services successfully or to obtain adequate returns on our products and services will not be impacted by the nature of the competition that now exists or may later develop or by the broader economic environment For a discussion of the risks related to our competitive environment see  Part I  Item 1A Risk Factors  SUPERVISION AND REGULATION General Capital One Financial Corporation is a bank holding company BHC and a financial holding company FHC under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 as amended BHC Act and is subject to the requirements of the BHC Act including approval requirements for investments in or acquisitions of banking organizations capital adequacy standards and limitations on nonbanking activities As a BHC and FHC we are subject to supervision examination and regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System Federal Reserve Permissible activities for a BHC include those activities that are so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto In addition an FHC is permitted to engage in activities considered to be financial in nature including for example securities underwriting and dealing and merchant banking activities incidental to financial activities or if the Federal Reserve determines that they pose no risk to the safety or soundness of depository institutions or the financial system in general activities complementary to financial activities To become and remain eligible for FHC status a BHC and its subsidiary depository institutions must meet certain criteria including capital management and Community Reinvestment Act CRA requirements Failure to meet such criteria could result depending on which requirements were not met in restrictions on new financial activities or acquisitions or being required to discontinue existing activities that are not generally permissible for BHCs The Banks are national associations chartered under the laws of the United States and the deposits of which are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund DIF of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC up to applicable limits The Banks are subject to comprehensive regulation and periodic examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency OCC the FDIC and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau CFPB We are also registered as a financial institution holding company under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia and as such we are subject to periodic examination by the Virginia Bureau of Financial Institutions We also face regulation in the international 7 Capital One Financial Corporation COF Table of Contents jurisdictions in which we conduct business See Regulation of Businesses by Authorities Outside the United States below for additional details Regulation of Business Activities The business activities of the Company and the Banks are also subject to regulation and supervision under various laws and regulations Regulations of Consumer Lending Activities The activities of the Banks as consumer lenders are subject to regulation under various federal laws including for example the Truth in Lending Act TILA the Equal Credit Opportunity Act the Fair Credit Reporting Act the CRA the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act and the Military Lending Act as well as under various state laws TILA as amended imposes a number of restrictions on credit card practices impacting rates and fees requires that a consumers ability to pay be taken into account before issuing credit or increasing credit limits and imposes revised disclosures required for openend credit Depending on the underlying issue and applicable law regulators may be authorized to impose penalties for violations of these statutes and in certain cases to order banks to compensate customers Borrowers may also have a private right of action for certain violations Federal bankruptcy and state debtor relief and collection laws may also affect the ability of a bank including the Banks to collect outstanding balances owed by borrowers Debit Interchange Fees The DoddFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act DoddFrank Act requires that the amount of any interchange fee received by a debit card issuer with respect to debit card transactions be reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the issuer with respect to the transaction Rules adopted by the Federal Reserve to implement these requirements limit interchange fees per debit card transaction to 021 plus five basis points of the transaction amount and provide for an additional 001 fraud prevention adjustment to the interchange fee for issuers that meet certain fraud prevention requirements Privacy We are subject to multiple federal and state laws concerning data privacy such as the GrammLeach Bliley Act This area has seen increasing legislative and regulatory activity For example in 2018 the State of California passed the California Consumer Privacy Act CCPA which creates obligations on covered companies to among other things share certain information they have collected about individuals who are California residents with those individuals subject to some exceptions The California Attorney General has received public comment on the proposed regulations and is expected to issue final CCPA regulations in the first half of 2020 We have analyzed the CCPA and determined its initial applicability to our business We will review the final CCPA regulations and determine their impact to our business while we continue to monitor data privacy legal developments in other jurisdictions Bank Secrecy Act and USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 The Bank Secrecy Act and the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 Patriot Act require financial institutions among other things to implement a riskbased program reasonably designed to prevent money laundering and to combat the financing of terrorism including through suspicious activity and currency transaction reporting compliance recordkeeping and customer due diligence The Patriot Act also contains financial transparency laws and provides enhanced information collection tools and enforcement mechanisms to the US government including due diligence and recordkeeping requirements for private banking and correspondent accounts standards for verifying customer identification at account opening rules to produce certain records upon request of a regulator or law enforcement agency and rules to promote cooperation among financial institutions regulators and law enforcement agencies in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism money laundering and other crimes Funding Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 FDICIA as discussed in MDA Liquidity Risk Profile  only well capitalized and adequately capitalized institutions may accept brokered deposits Adequately capitalized institutions however must obtain a waiver from the FDIC before accepting brokered deposits and such institutions may not pay rates that significantly exceed the rates paid on deposits of similar maturity obtained from the institutions normal market area or for deposits obtained from outside the institutions normal market area the national rate on deposits of comparable maturity The 8 Capital One Financial Corporation COF Table of Contents FDIC is authorized to terminate a banks deposit insurance upon a finding by the FDIC that the banks financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or has violated any applicable rule regulation order or condition enacted or imposed by the banks regulatory agency The termination of deposit insurance would likely have a material adverse effect on a banks liquidity and earnings Nonbank Activities Certain of our nonbank subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation by various other federal and state authorities United Income Inc is an investment adviser registered with the SEC and regulated under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 Capital One Securities Inc and KippsDeSanto  Company are registered brokerdealers regulated by the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority Our brokerdealer subsidiaries are subject among other things to net capital rules designed to measure the general financial condition and liquidity of a brokerdealer Under these rules brokerdealers are required to maintain the minimum net capital deemed necessary to meet their continuing commitments to customers and others and to keep a substantial portion of their assets in relatively liquid form These rules also limit the ability of a brokerdealer to transfer capital to its parent companies and other affiliates Brokerdealers are also subject to regulations covering their business operations including sales and trading practices public offerings publication of research reports use and safekeeping of client funds and securities capital structure recordkeeping and the conduct of directors officers and employees Derivatives Activities The Commodity Futures Trading Commission CFTC and the SEC have jointly issued final rules further defining the DoddFrank Acts swap dealer definitions Based on these rules no Capital One entity is currently required to register with the CFTC or SEC as a swap dealer The DoddFrank Act also requires all swap market participants to keep certain swap transaction records and report pertinent information to swap data repositories on a realtime and ongoing basis Further each swap group category type or class of swap that the CFTC or SEC determines must be cleared through a derivatives clearinghouse unless the swap is eligible for a clearing exemption must also be executed on a designated contract market DCM exchange or swap execution facility SEF unless no DCM exchange or SEF has made the swap available for trading Volcker Rule We and each of our subsidiaries including the Banks are subject to the Volcker Rule a provision of the DoddFrank Act that contains prohibitions on proprietary trading and certain investments in and relationships with covered funds hedge funds private equity funds and similar funds subject to certain exemptions in each case as the applicable terms are defined in the Volcker Rule and the implementing regulations The implementing regulations also require that we establish and maintain a compliance program designed to ensure adherence with the requirements of the regulations Capital and Liquidity Regulation The Company and the Banks are subject to capital adequacy guidelines adopted by the Federal Reserve and OCC For a further discussion of the capital adequacy guidelines see MDA Capital Management  MDA Liquidity Risk Profile  and  Note 11Regulatory and Capital Adequacy  Basel III and United States Capital Rules The Federal Reserve OCC and FDIC collectively the Federal Banking Agencies have issued regulations Basel III Capital Rule that implement certain capital and liquidity requirements published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision Basel Committee along with certain DoddFrank Act and other capital provisions The Basel III Capital Rule includes the Basel III Standardized Approach and the Basel III Advanced Approaches Prior to January 1 2020 the Basel III Advanced Approaches were mandatory for institutions with total consolidated assets of 250 billion or more or total consolidated onbalance sheet foreign exposure of 10 billion or more The Basel III Capital Rule revised the definition of regulatory capital established a new common equity Tier 1 capital requirement set higher minimum capital ratio requirements and introduced a capital conservation buffer of 25 a supplementary leverage ratio of 30 and a countercyclical capital buffer currently set at 00 Compliance with the Basel III Capital Rule went into effect for Capital One beginning on January 1 2014 with certain provisions becoming effective later according to various start dates and phasein periods that ended January 1 2019 In October 2019 the Federal Banking Agencies amended the Basel III Capital Rule to provide for tailored application of certain capital requirements across different categories of banking institutions Tailoring Rules These categories are determined primarily by an institutions asset size with adjustments to a more stringent category possible if the institution exceeds certain 9 Capital One Financial Corporation COF Table of Contents other riskbased thresholds As a BHC with total consolidated assets of at least 250 billion that does not exceed any of the applicable riskbased thresholds we are a Category III institution under the Tailoring Rules Therefore we are no longer subject to the Basel III Advanced Approaches and certain associated capital requirements such as the requirement to include in regulatory capital certain elements of Accumulated other comprehensive income AOCI although we will remain subject to the countercyclical capital buffer and supplementary leverage ratio which were previously required only for Basel III Advanced Approaches institutions In July 2019 the Federal Banking Agencies finalized certain changes to the Basel III Capital Rule for institutions not subject to the Basel III Advanced Approaches including Capital One Capital Simplification Rule These changes effective January 1 2020 generally raise the threshold above which covered institutions must deduct certain assets from their common equity Tier 1 capital including certain deferred tax assets mortgage servicing assets and investments in unconsolidated financial institutions We anticipate that the Tailoring Rules and Capital Simplification Rule will taken together decrease our capital requirements Global systemically important banks GSIBs that are based in the US are subject to an additional common equity Tier 1 capital requirement GSIB Surcharge We are not a GSIB based on the most recent available data and thus we are not subject to a GSIB Surcharge In December 2018 the Federal Banking Agencies issued a final rule to address regulatory capital treatment of credit loss allowances under the current expected credit loss CECL model The CECL model became applicable to Capital One as of January 1 2020 The rule CECL Capital Rule revises the Federal Banking Agencies regulatory capital rules to identify which credit loss allowances under the CECL model are eligible for inclusion in regulatory capital and to provide banking organizations the option to phase in over a threeyear transition period ending January 1 2023 the dayone adverse effects on regulatory capital that may result from the adoption of the CECL model CECL Transition Election We intend to make the CECL Transition Election beginning in the first quarter of 2020 Market Risk Rule The Market Risk Rule supplements the Basel III Capital Rule by requiring institutions subject to the Market Risk Rule to adjust their riskbased capital ratios to reflect the market risk in their trading portfolios The Market Risk Rule generally applies to institutions with aggregate trading assets and liabilities equal to the lesser of  10 or more of total assets or  1 billion or more As of December 31 2019 the Company and CONA are subject to the Market Risk Rule See MDA Market Risk Profile  below for additional information Basel III and United States Liquidity Rules The Basel Committee has published a liquidity framework that includes two standards for liquidity risk supervision One standard the liquidity coverage ratio LCR seeks to promote shortterm resilience by requiring organizations to hold sufficient highquality liquid assets to survive a stress scenario lasting for 30 days The other standard the net stable funding ratio NSFR seeks to promote longerterm resilience by requiring sufficient stable funding over a oneyear period based on the liquidity characteristics of its assets and activities The Company and the Banks are subject to the LCR as implemented by the Federal Reserve and OCC LCR Rule The LCR Rule requires the Company and each of the Banks to hold an amount of eligible highquality liquid assets HQLA that equals or exceeds 100 of their respective projected adjusted net cash outflows over a 30day period each as calculated in accordance with the LCR Rule The LCR Rule requires us to calculate the LCR daily In addition the Company is required to make quarterly public disclosures of its LCR and certain related quantitative liquidity metrics along with a qualitative discussion of its LCR Under the Tailoring Rules as a Category III institution with less than 75 billion in weighted average shortterm wholesale funding the Companys and the Banks total net cash outflows are multiplied by an outflow adjustment percentage of 85 We expect this outflow adjustment to materially increase the LCR for the Banks but not for the Company The LCR Rule restricts the amount of HQLA held at the Banks in excess of the Banks total net cash outflow amount that can be included in the Companys HQLA amount referred to as Trapped Liquidity Therefore although we typically manage Banklevel LCRs at a level well above the regulatory minimum of 100 the amount of Trapped Liquidity will also increase as the Banks total net cash outflows are reduced 10 Capital One Financial Corporation COF Table of Contents by the 85 factor That increase in Trapped Liquidity will prevent the Companys LCR from materially changing as a result of the Tailoring Rules In April 2016 the Federal Banking Agencies issued an interagency notice of proposed rulemaking regarding the US implementation of the Basel III NSFR Proposed NSFR which would apply to the same institutions subject to the LCR Rule The Proposed NSFR would require us to maintain a sufficient amount of stable funding in relation to our assets derivatives exposures and commitments over a oneyear horizon period Although the Proposed NSFR is generally consistent with the Basel NSFR standard it is more stringent in certain areas The financial and operational impact on us of a final NSFR rule remains uncertain until a final rule is published There is uncertainty regarding the timing and form of any such final rule FDICIA and Prompt Corrective Action The FDICIA requires the Federal Banking Agencies to take prompt corrective action for banks that do not meet minimum capital requirements The FDICIA establishes five capital ratio levels well capitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized The three undercapitalized categories are based upon the amount by which a bank falls below the ratios applicable to an adequately capitalized institution The capital categories are determined solely for purposes of applying the FDICIAs prompt corrective action PCA provisions and such capital categories may not constitute an accurate representation of the Banks overall financial condition or prospects The Basel III Capital Rule updated the PCA framework to reflect new higher regulatory capital minimums For an insured depository institution to be well capitalized it must maintain a total riskbased capital ratio of 10 or more a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8 or more a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 65 or more and a leverage ratio of 5 or more An adequately capitalized depository institution must maintain a total riskbased capital ratio of 8 or more a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6 or more a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 45 or more a leverage ratio of 4 or more and for Category III and certain other institutions under the Tailoring Rules a supplementary leverage ratio of 3 or more The PCA provisions also authorize the Federal Banking Agencies to reclassify a banks capital category or take other action against banks that are determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or to have engaged in unsafe or unsound banking practices As an additional means to identify problems in the financial management of depository institutions the FDICIA required the Federal Banking Agencies to establish certain noncapital safety and soundness standards The standards adopted by the Federal Banking Agencies relate generally to operations and management asset quality interest rate exposure and executive compensation The Federal Banking Agencies are authorized to take action against institutions that fail to meet such standards Enhanced Prudential Standards and Other Requirements Under the DoddFrank Act We are a covered company subject under the DoddFrank Act to certain enhanced prudential standards including requirements that may be recommended by the Financial Stability Oversight Council FSOC and implemented by the Federal Reserve and other regulators We remain a covered company under the amendments to the DoddFrank Act made by the Economic Growth Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act EGRRCPA which provided reduced enhanced prudential standards for institutions with less than 250 billion in assets As a result we are subject to more stringent standards and requirements than those applicable to institutions that are not covered companies The FSOC may also issue recommendations to the Federal Reserve or other primary financial regulatory agencies to apply new or enhanced standards to certain financial activities or practices The Federal Reserve and FDIC have issued rules requiring the Company to implement resolution planning for orderly resolution in the event the covered company faces material financial distress or failure The FDIC issued similar rules regarding resolution planning applicable to the Banks In addition the OCC has issued rules requiring banks with assets of 250 billion or more to develop recovery plans detailing the actions they would take to remain a going concern when they experience considerable financial or operational stress but have not deteriorated to the point that resolution is imminent The Federal Reserve established a rule that implements the requirement in the DoddFrank Act that the Federal Reserve conduct annual stress tests on the capacity of our capital to absorb losses as a result of adverse economic conditions This rule also requires the Company to conduct its own stress tests and publish the results of the stress tests on our website or other public forum As a Category III institution under the Tailoring Rules the Company must disclose the results of its companyrun stress test in 2020 and every two years thereafter The OCC has adopted a similar stress test rule requiring banks with at least 250 billion in assets including CONA to conduct their own companyrun stress tests Under that OCC rule CONA must disclose the results of this stress test in 2020 and every two years thereafter 11 Capital One Financial Corporation COF Table of Contents The Federal Reserve also established rules implementing other aspects of the enhanced prudential standards under the DoddFrank Act Enhanced Standards Rule Under the Enhanced Standards Rule the Company must meet liquidity risk management standards conduct internal liquidity stress tests and maintain a 30day buffer of highly liquid assets in each case consistent with the requirements of the Enhanced Standards Rule These requirements are in addition to the LCR discussed above in Basel III and United States Liquidity Rules The Enhanced Standards Rule also requires that the Company comply with and hold capital commensurate with the requirements of any regulations adopted by the Federal Reserve relating to capital planning and stress tests Stress testing and capital planning regulations are discussed further below under Dividends Stock Repurchases and Transfers of Funds The Enhanced Standards Rule also requires that the Company establish and maintain an enterprisewide risk management framework that includes a risk committee and a chief risk officer Although not a requirement of the DoddFrank Act the OCC established regulatory guidelines Heightened Standards Guidelines that apply heightened standards for risk management to large institutions subject to its supervision including the Banks The Heightened Standards Guidelines establish standards for the development and implementation by the Banks of a risk governance framework Investment in the Company and the Banks Certain acquisitions of our capital stock may be subject to regulatory approval or notice under federal or state law Investors are responsible for ensuring that they do not directly or indirectly acquire shares of our capital stock in excess of the amount that can be acquired without regulatory approval including under the BHC Act and the Change in Bank Control Act CIBC Act Federal law and regulations prohibit any person or company from acquiring control of the Company or the Banks without in most cases prior written approval of the Federal Reserve or the OCC as applicable Control exists if among other things a person or company acquires more than 25 of any class of our voting stock or otherwise has a controlling influence over us For a publicly traded BHC such as ourselves a rebuttable presumption of control arises under the CIBC Act if a person or company acquires more than 10 of any class of our voting stock Additionally COBNA and CONA are banks within the meaning of Chapter 13 of Title 61 of the Code of Virginia governing the acquisition of interests in Virginia financial institutions Financial Institution Holding Company Act The Financial Institution Holding Company Act prohibits any person or entity from acquiring or making any public offer to acquire control of a Virginia financial institution or its holding company without making application to and receiving prior approval from the Virginia Bureau of Financial Institutions Dividends Stock Repurchases and Transfers of Funds Under the Federal Reserves capital planning rules commonly referred to as Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review or CCAR covered BHCs including ourselves must submit a capital plan to the Federal Reserve on an annual basis that contains a description of all planned capital actions including dividends or stock repurchases over a ninequarter planning horizon beginning with the first quarter of the calendar year the capital plan is submitted CCAR cycle A covered BHC may take the proposed capital actions if the Federal Reserve does not object to the plan DoddFrank Act stress testing described above in Enhanced Prudential Standards and Other Requirements under the DoddFrank Act is a complementary exercise to CCAR It is a forwardlooking exercise conducted by the Federal Reserve and covered financial companies to help assess whether a company has sufficient capital to absorb losses and support operations during adverse economic conditions The supervisory stress test after incorporating a firms planned capital actions is used for quantitative assessment in CCAR The Company must file its capital plan and stress testing results with the Federal Reserve by April 5 of each year unless the Federal Reserve designates a later date using data as of the end of the prior calendar year The Federal Reserve is expected to provide its objection or nonobjection to that capital plan in June of that year The Federal Reserves objection or nonobjection applies to planned capital actions from the third quarter of the year the capital plan is submitted through the end of the second quarter of the following year The Company along with other BHCs subject to the supplementary leverage ratio must incorporate an estimate of its supplementary leverage ratio into its capital plan and stress tests The current capital planning and stress testing rules place supervisory focus on quarterly capital issuances and distributions by establishing a cumulative net distribution requirement Under a de minimis exception if a company does not receive an objection to its capital plan it may in certain cases distribute up to 025 of its Tier 1 capital above the distributions in its capital plan With certain limited exceptions to the extent a BHC does not issue the amount of a given class of regulatory capital instrument that it 12 Capital One Financial Corporation COF Table of Contents projected in its capital plan as measured on an aggregate basis beginning in the third quarter of the planning horizon the BHC must reduce its capital distributions In December 2018 the Federal Reserve announced that it will maintain its preCECL framework for calculating allowances on loans in the supervisory stress test for the 2020 and 2021 supervisory stress testing cycles until the impact of CECL is better known and understood The Federal Reserve stated further that although bank holding companies required to perform companyrun stress tests will be required to incorporate CECL into those stress tests starting in the 2020 cycle it will not issue supervisory findings on those firms allowance estimations in the CCAR exercise through 2021 In April 2018 the Federal Reserve issued a proposed rule Stress Capital Buffer Proposed Rule that would implement a firmspecific stress capital buffer requirement and a stress leverage buffer requirement The Federal Reserve described the Stress Capital Buffer Proposed Rule as designed to simplify the agencys regulatory regime by integrating the supervisory stress tests with its nonstress capital rules Under the Stress Capital Buffer Proposed Rule a firms stress capital buffer would have a floor of 25 of total riskweighted assets replacing the existing 25 capital conservation buffer and would equal as a percentage of total riskweighted assets the sum of i the difference between a firms starting common equity Tier 1 capital ratio and the low point under the severely adverse scenario of the Federal Reserves supervisory stress test plus ii the ratio of the firms projected four quarters of common stock dividends to riskweighted assets as projected under CCAR for the fourth to seventh quarters of the planning horizon A firms new Standardized Approach capital conservation buffer would include its stress capital buffer any GSIB surcharge not applicable to us and any applicable countercyclical capital buffer currently set at zero The consequences of breaching the stress capital buffer requirement would be consistent with the current capital conservation buffer framework and would result in increasingly strict limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments The Stress Capital Buffer Proposed Rule would replace the current CCAR poststress leverage ratio requirement with a stress leverage buffer requirement Additionally the proposal would modify certain CCAR assumptions relating to balance sheet growth prefunding of dividends and capital distributions It is not clear which of these changes if any will be finalized and when they would go into effect Historically dividends from the Companys direct and indirect subsidiaries have represented a major source of the funds we have used to pay dividends on our stock make payments on corporate debt securities and meet our other obligations There are various federal law limitations on the extent to which the Banks can finance or otherwise supply funds to us through dividends and loans These limitations include minimum regulatory capital requirements federal banking law requirements concerning the payment of dividends out of net profits or surplus provisions of Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation W governing transactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliates as well as general federal regulatory oversight to prevent unsafe or unsound practices In general federal and applicable state banking laws prohibit insured depository institutions such as the Banks from making dividend distributions without first obtaining regulatory approval if such distributions are not paid out of available earnings or would cause the institution to fail to meet applicable capital adequacy standards Deposit Insurance Assessments Each of CONA and COBNA as an insured depository institution is a member of the DIF maintained by the FDIC Through the DIF the FDIC insures the deposits of insured depository institutions up to prescribed limits for each depositor The FDIC sets a Designated Reserve Ratio DRR for the DIF To maintain the DIF member institutions may be assessed an insurance premium and the FDIC may take action to increase insurance premiums if the DRR falls below its required level Source of Strength and Liability for Commonly Controlled Institutions Under regulations issued by the Federal Reserve a BHC must serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks the socalled source of strength doctrine The DoddFrank Act codified this doctrine Under the crossguarantee provision of the Financial Institutions Reform Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 FIRREA insured depository institutions such as the Banks may be liable to the FDIC with respect to any loss incurred or reasonably anticipated to be incurred by the FDIC in connection with the default of or FDIC assistance to any commonly controlled insured depository institution The Banks are commonly controlled within the meaning of the FIRREA crossguarantee provision FDIC Orderly Liquidation Authority The DoddFrank Act provides the FDIC with liquidation authority that may be used to liquidate nonbank financial companies and BHCs if the Treasury Secretary in consultation with the President and based on the recommendation of the Federal Reserve and other appropriate Federal Banking Agencies determines that doing so is necessary among other criteria to mitigate serious adverse 13 Capital One Financial Corporation COF Table of Contents effects on US financial stability Upon such a determination the FDIC would be appointed receiver and must liquidate the company in a way that mitigates significant risks to financial stability and minimizes moral hazard The costs of a liquidation of the company would be borne by shareholders and unsecured creditors and then if necessary by riskbased assessments on large financial companies The FDIC has issued rules implementing certain provisions of its liquidation authority and may issue additional rules in the future Regulation of Businesses by Authorities Outside the United States COBNA is subject to regulation in foreign jurisdictions where it operates currently in the United Kingdom and Canada United Kingdom In the United Kingdom COBNA operates through COEP which was established in 2000 and is an authorized payment institution regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority FCA under the Payment Services Regulations 2017 and the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 COEPs indirect parent Capital One Global Corporation is whollyowned by COBNA and is subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve as an agreement corporation under the Federal Reserves Regulation K The FCA set a deadline of August 29 2019 the Deadline for the submission of complaints to firms including COEP about Payment Protection Insurance PPI In order to ensure complainants were treated fairly and in anticipation of the increase in complaint volumes that the Deadline would create the FCA closely supervised all large lenders including COEP throughout 2019 COEP received a significant volume of complaints particularly in the weeks immediately preceding the Deadline and expects to be handling those complaints through the second quarter of 2020 Escalations to the Financial Ombudsman Service FOS may then take place until the end of 2020 During that time the FCA will continue to closely supervise firms that handle PPI complaints and the supporting

strengthen provisions that apply to banks and authorized foreign banks in the areas of consumer protection corporate governance business practices public reporting disclosure of information and access to basic banking services Bill C86 also amends the FCAC Act to enhance the role and powers of the FCAC by among other things increasing the maximum penalty for a violation of the consumer protection provisions of the Bank Act from 50000 Canadian dollars CAD for natural persons and 500000 CAD in the case of financial institutions or a payment card network to 1 million CAD and 10 million CAD respectively We are continuing to analyze the impacts of Bill C86 in order to determine its applicability and impact to our business In August 2018 the Government of Canada announced new voluntary commitments from Visa Canada and MasterCard Canada which will take effect when the original commitments end in 2020 As part of their new commitments Visa and Mastercard will further reduce interchange fees for consumer credit cards by approximately 10 basis points to an annual average effective rate of 14 for a period of five years Visa and Mastercard will also narrow the range of interchange rates

Contents Item 1A Risk Factors This section highlights significant factors events and uncertainties that make an investment in our securities risky The events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could in circumstances we may not be able to accurately predict recognize or control have a material adverse effect on our business growth reputation prospects financial condition operating results cash flows liquidity and stock price These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face our operations could also be affected by factors events or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations In addition the global economic and political climate amplifies many of these risks General Economic and Market Risks Changes and instability in the macroeconomic environment consumer confidence and customer behavior may adversely affect our business We offer a broad array of financial products and services to consumers small businesses and commercial clients A prolonged period of economic volatility slow growth or a significant deterioration in economic conditions in the United States Canada or the United Kingdom could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations as customers default on their loans maintain lower deposit levels or in the case of credit card accounts carry lower balances and reduce credit card purchase activity Some of the risks we face in connection with adverse changes and instability in the macroeconomic environment including changes in consumer confidence levels and behavior include the following  Changes in payment patterns increases in delinquencies and default rates decreased consumer spending lower demand for credit and shifts in consumer payment behavior towards avoiding late fees finance charges and other fees  Increases in our chargeoff rate caused by bankruptcies and reduced ability to recover debt that we have previously chargedoff  Decreased reliability of the process and models we use to estimate our allowance for loan and lease losses particularly if unexpected variations in key inputs and assumptions cause actual losses to diverge from the projections of our models and our estimates become increasingly subject to managements judgment See  We face risks resulting from the extensive use of models and data  In the United Kingdom changes in consumer behavior or an economic slowdown arising from the UKs exit from the European Union Brexit could adversely affect our UK operations The impact of Brexit and its full effects on us are uncertain and will depend on the postBrexit relationships that the UK implements with the European Union EU and countries that are not a part of the EU While Capital One does not have operations in any other EU jurisdictions increased market volatility and global economic deterioration resulting from an uncontrolled Brexit could have a negative impact on credit conditions in the UK and negatively affect our business and financial condition Financial market instability and volatility could adversely affect our business Our ability to borrow from other financial institutions or to engage in funding transactions on favorable terms or at all could be adversely affected by disruptions in the capital markets or other events including actions by rating agencies and deteriorating investor expectations which could limit our access to funding In addition fluctuations in interest rates credit spreads and other market factors could negatively impact our results of operations Both shorterterm and longerterm interest rates remain below longterm historical averages and the yield curve has been relatively flat compared to past periods A flat yield curve combined with low interest rates generally leads to lower revenue and reduced margins because it tends to limit our ability to increase the spread between asset yields and funding costs Sustained periods of time with a flat yield curve coupled with low interest rates or an inversion of the yield curve could have a material adverse effect on our net interest margin and earnings Regulatory Risk Compliance with new and existing laws regulations and regulatory expectations is costly and complex We are subject to extensive regulatory oversight by the federal banking regulators to ensure that we build systems and processes that are commensurate with the nature of our business and that meet the risk management and prudential standards issued by our regulators A wide array of banking and consumer lending laws apply to almost every aspect of our business Failure to comply 18 Capital One Financial Corporation COF Table of Contents with these laws and regulations could result in financial structural and operational penalties including significant fines and criminal sanctions andor damage to our reputation with regulators our customers or the public Hiring training and retaining qualified compliance and legal personnel and establishing and maintaining compliancerelated systems infrastructure and processes is difficult and these efforts could limit our ability to invest in other business opportunities Furthermore applicable rules and regulations may affect us in an unforeseen manner or may have a disproportionate impact on us as compared to our competitors For example over the last several years state and federal regulators have focused on compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act and antimoney laundering laws data integrity and security use of service providers fair lending and other consumer protection issues In July 2015 Capital One entered into a consent order with the OCC to address concerns about our antimoney laundering AML program and in October 2018 Capital One paid a civil monetary penalty assessed by the OCC relating to our AML program The OCC lifted the AML consent order in November 2019 Failure to maintain compliance with AML laws and regulations could result in significant additional governmental fines or penalties We have a large number of customer accounts in our credit card and auto lending businesses and we have made the strategic choice to originate and service subprime credit card and auto loans which typically have higher delinquencies and chargeoffs than prime customers As a result we have significant involvement with credit bureau reporting and the collection and recovery of delinquent and chargedoff debt primarily through customer communications the filing of litigation against customers in default the periodic sale of chargedoff debt and vehicle repossession These activities are subject to enhanced legal and regulatory scrutiny from regulators courts and legislators Any future changes to our business practices in these areas including our debt collection practices whether mandated by regulators courts legislators or otherwise or any legal liabilities resulting from our business practices including our debt collection practices could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition The legislative and regulatory environment is beyond our control may change rapidly and unpredictably and may negatively influence our revenue costs earnings growth liquidity and capital levels In addition some rules and regulations may be subject to litigation or other challenges that delay or modify their implementation and impact on us Adoption of new technologies such as distributed ledger technologies artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies can present unforeseen challenges in applying and relying on existing compliance systems Certain laws and regulations and any interpretations and applications with respect thereto may benefit consumers borrowers and depositors but not stockholders Our success depends on our ability to maintain compliance with both existing and new laws and regulations For a description of the material laws and regulations to which we are subject see  Part I  Item 1 Business  Supervision and Regulation  Credit Risk We may experience increased delinquencies credit losses inaccurate estimates and inadequate reserves Like other lenders we face the risk that our customers will not repay their loans A customers ability and willingness to repay us can be adversely affected by increases in their payment obligations to other lenders whether as a result of higher debt levels or rising interest rates by restricted availability of credit generally or by the revenue and income of the borrower We may fail to quickly identify and reduce our exposure to customers that are likely to default on their payment obligations whether by closing credit lines or restricting authorizations Our ability to manage credit risk also is affected by legal or regulatory changes such as restrictions on collections bankruptcy laws minimum payment regulations and reage guidance competitors actions and consumer behavior and depends on the effectiveness of our collections staff techniques and models Rising losses or leading indicators of rising losses such as higher delinquencies higher rates of nonperforming loans higher bankruptcy rates lower collateral values elevated unemployment rates or changing market terms may require us to increase our allowance for loan and lease losses which may degrade our profitability if we are unable to raise revenue or reduce costs to compensate for higher losses In particular we face the following risks in this area  Missed Payments Our customers may miss payments Loan chargeoffs including from bankruptcies are generally preceded by missed payments or other indications of worsening financial condition for our customers Historically customers are more likely to miss payments during an economic downturn or prolonged periods of slow economic growth In addition we face the risk that consumer and commercial customer behavior may change for example an increase in the unwillingness or inability of customers to repay debt which may be heightened by increasing interest rates or levels of consumer debt causing a longterm rise in delinquencies and chargeoffs  Incorrect Estimates of Inherent Losses The credit quality of our portfolio can have a significant impact on our earnings We allow for and reserve against credit risks based on our assessment of credit losses inherent in our loan portfolios This 19 Capital One Financial Corporation COF Table of Contents process which is critical to our financial condition and results of operations requires complex judgments including forecasts of economic conditions We may underestimate our inherent losses and fail to hold an allowance for loan and lease losses sufficient to account for these losses Incorrect assumptions could lead to material underestimations of inherent losses and inadequate allowance for loan and lease losses In cases where we modify a loan if the modifications do not perform as anticipated we may be required to build additional allowance on these loans The build or release of allowances impacts our financial results  Inaccurate Underwriting Our ability to accurately assess the creditworthiness of our customers may diminish which could result in an increase in our credit losses and a deterioration of our returns See  Our risk management strategies may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposures in all market environments or against all types of risk   Business Mix We engage in a diverse mix of businesses with a broad range of potential credit exposure Because we originate a relatively greater proportion of consumer loans in our loan portfolio compared to other large bank peers and originate both prime and subprime credit card accounts and auto loans we may experience higher delinquencies and a greater number of accounts charging off compared to other large bank peers which could result in increased credit losses operating costs and regulatory scrutiny Additionally a change in this business mix over time to include proportionally more consumer loans or subprime credit card accounts or auto loans could adversely affect the credit quality of our portfolio  Increasing Chargeoff Recognition  Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses We account for the allowance for loan and lease losses according to accounting and regulatory guidelines and rules including Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB standards and the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council FFIEC Account Management Guidance Effective as of January 1 2020 we are required to use the CECL model based on expected rather than incurred losses Adoption of the CECL model will result in an increase to our reserves for credit losses on financial instruments with a resulting negative adjustment to retained earnings The impact of CECL on our future results will depend on the characteristics of our financial instruments economic conditions and our economic and loss forecasts The application of the CECL model may require us to increase reserves faster and to a higher level in an economic downturn resulting in greater impact to our results and our capital ratios than we would have experienced in similar circumstances prior to the adoption of CECL In addition because credit cards represent a significant portion of our product mix we could be disproportionately affected by use of the CECL model as compared to other large bank peers with a different product mix See MDA Accounting Changes and Developments  for additional information  Insufficient Asset Values The collateral we have on secured loans could be insufficient to compensate us for loan losses When customers default on their secured loans we attempt to recover collateral where permissible and appropriate However the value of the collateral may not be sufficient to compensate us for the amount of the unpaid loan and we may be unsuccessful in recovering the remaining balance from our customers Decreases in real estate and other asset values adversely affect the collateral value for our commercial lending activities while the auto business is similarly exposed to collateral risks arising from the auction markets that determine used car prices Borrowers may be less likely to continue making payments on loans if the value of the property used as collateral for the loan is less than what the borrower owes even if the borrower is still financially able to make the payments In that circumstance the recovery of such property could be insufficient to compensate us for the value of these loans upon a default In our auto business business and economic conditions that negatively affect household incomes housing prices and consumer behavior as well as technological advances that make older cars obsolete faster could decrease i the demand for new and used vehicles and ii the value of the collateral underlying our portfolio of auto loans which could cause the number of consumers who become delinquent or default on their loans to increase  Geographic and Industry Concentration Although our consumer lending is geographically diversified approximately 27 of our commercial loan portfolio is concentrated in the tristate area of New York New Jersey and Connecticut The regional economic conditions in the tristate area affect the demand for our commercial products and services as well as the ability of our customers to repay their commercial loans and the value of the collateral securing these loans An economic downturn or prolonged period of slow economic growth in or a catastrophic event that disproportionately affects the tristate area could have a material adverse effect on the performance of our commercial loan portfolio and our results of operations In addition our Commercial Banking strategy includes an industryspecific focus If any of the industries that we focus on experience changes we may experience increased credit losses and our results of operations could be adversely impacted For example as of December 31 2019 healthcare and healthcarerelated real estate loans represented approximately 18 of our total commercial loan portfolio If healthcarerelated industries or any of the other industries that we focus on experience adverse changes we may experience increased credit losses and our results of operations could be adversely impacted 20 Capital One Financial Corporation COF Table of Contents Capital and Liquidity Risk We may not be able to maintain adequate capital or liquidity levels which could have a negative impact on our financial results and our ability to return capital to our stockholders Financial institutions are subject to extensive and complex capital and liquidity requirements These requirements affect our ability to lend grow deposit balances make acquisitions and make most capital distributions Failure to maintain adequate capital or liquidity levels whether due to adverse developments in our business or the economy or to changes in the applicable requirements could subject us to a variety of enforcement remedies available to our regulators These include limitations on the ability to pay dividends and repurchase shares and the issuance of a capital directive to increase capital Such limitations could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations We consider various factors in the management of capital including the impact of stress on our capital levels as determined by both our internal modeling and the Federal Reserves modeling of our capital position in supervisory stress tests and CCAR There can be significant differences between our modeling and the Federal Reserves estimates for a given scenario and between the capital needs suggested by our internal bank holding company scenarios relative to the supervisory scenarios Therefore although our estimated capital levels under stress disclosed as part of the CCAR or DFAST processes may suggest that we have substantial capacity to return capital to stockholders and remain well capitalized under stress the Federal Reserves modeling our internal modeling of another scenario or other factors related to our capital management process may result in a materially lower capacity to return capital to stockholders than that indicated by the projections released in the CCAR or DFAST processes This in turn could lead to restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and engage in share repurchase transactions See  Part I  Item 1 Business  Supervision and Regulation  for additional information In addition the current capital and liquidity requirements are subject to change The Federal Banking Agencies finalized the Tailoring Rule in the fourth quarter of 2019 Under the Tailoring Rule we are a Category III institution and are no longer subject to the Basel III Advanced Approaches and associated capital requirements but we continue to be subject to the countercyclical capital buffer and supplementary leverage ratio In addition the Federal Reserve is currently considering a proposed rule the Stress Capital Buffer Proposed Rule that would modify our current Basel III capital requirements and implement firmspecific stress capital requirements If the Stress Capital Buffer Proposed Rule is not adopted substantially as proposed or there are other changes to applicable capital and liquidity requirements we could face unexpected or new limitations on our ability to pay dividends and engage in share repurchases Operational Risk We face risks related to our operational technological and organizational infrastructure Our ability to retain and attract customers depends on our ability to develop operate and adapt our technology and organizational infrastructure in a rapidly changing environment In addition we must accurately process record and monitor an increasingly large number of complex transactions Digital technology data and software development are deeply embedded into our business model and how we work Similar to other large corporations we are exposed to operational risk that can manifest itself in many ways such as errors in execution inadequate processes inaccurate models faulty or disabled technological infrastructure and fraud by employees or persons outside of our company In addition we are heavily dependent on the security capability and continuous availability of the technology systems that we use to manage our internal financial and other systems monitor risk and compliance with regulatory requirements provide services to our customers develop and offer new products and communicate with stakeholders If we do not maintain the necessary operational technological and organizational infrastructure to operate our business including to maintain the security of that infrastructure our business and reputation could be materially adversely affected We also are subject to disruptions to our operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond our control which may include computer viruses electrical or telecommunications outages design flaws in foundational components or platforms availability and quality of vulnerability patches from key vendors cyberattacks including Distributed Denial of Service DDOS and other attacks on our infrastructure as discussed below natural disasters other damage to property or physical assets or events arising from local or larger scale politics including terrorist acts Any failure to maintain our infrastructure or disruption of our operating systems and applications could diminish our ability to operate our businesses service customer accounts and protect customers information or result in potential liability to customers reputational damage regulatory intervention and customers loss of confidence in our businesses any of which could result in a material adverse effect 21 Capital One Financial Corporation COF Table of Contents We also rely on the business infrastructure and systems of third parties with which we do business and to whom we outsource the operation maintenance and development of our information technology and communications systems We have migrated substantially all and intend to migrate all of our core information technology systems and customerfacing applications to thirdparty cloud infrastructure platforms principally AWS If we do not complete the transition or fail to administer these new environments in a wellmanaged secure and effective manner or if AWS platforms become unavailable or do not meet their service level agreements for any reason we may experience unplanned service disruption or unforeseen costs which could result in material harm to our business and results of operations We must successfully develop and maintain information financial reporting disclosure dataprotection and other controls adapted to our reliance on outside platforms and providers In addition AWS or other service providers could experience system breakdowns or failures outages downtime cyberattacks adverse changes to financial condition bankruptcy or other adverse conditions which could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation Thus the substantial amount of our infrastructure that we outsource to AWS or to other third parties may increase our risk exposure Any disruptions failures or inaccuracies of our operational and technology systems and models including those associated with improvements or modifications to such systems and models could cause us to be unable to market and manage our products and services manage our risk meet our regulatory obligations or report our financial results in a timely and accurate manner all of which could have a negative impact on our results of operations In addition our ongoing investments in infrastructure which are necessary to maintain a competitive business integrate acquisitions and establish scalable operations may increase our expenses As our business develops changes or expands additional expenses can arise as a result of a reevaluation of business strategies management of outsourced services asset purchases or other acquisitions structural reorganization compliance with new laws or regulations or the integration of newly acquired businesses or the occurrence of incidents such as the Cybersecurity Incident If we are unable to successfully manage our expenses our financial results will be negatively affected Increased costs reductions in revenue reputational damage and business disruptions can result from the theft loss or misuse of information including as a result of a cyberattack Our products and services involve the gathering authenticating managing processing and the storage and transmission of sensitive and confidential information regarding our customers and their accounts our employees and third parties with which we do business Our ability to provide such products and services many of which are webbased depends upon the management and safeguarding of information software methodologies and business secrets To provide these products and services to as well as communicate with our customers we rely on information systems and infrastructure including software and data engineering and information security personnel digital technologies computer and email systems software networks and other webbased technologies We also have arrangements in place with third parties through which we share and receive information about their customers who are or may become our customers Technologies systems networks and devices of Capital One or our customers employees service providers or other third parties with whom we interact continue to be the subject of attempted unauthorized access mishandling or misuse of information denialofservice attacks computer viruses website defacement hacking malware ransomware phishing or other forms of social engineering and other forms of cyberattacks designed to obtain confidential information destroy data disrupt or degrade service sabotage systems or cause other damage and other events These threats such as the Cybersecurity Incident may derive from error fraud or malice on the part of our employees insiders or third parties or may result from accidental technological failure Any of these parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees customers or other thirdparty users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or that of our customers or third parties with whom we interact or to unlawfully obtain monetary benefit through misdirected or otherwise improper payment Further cyber and information security risks for large financial institutions like us continue to increase due to the proliferation of new technologies the use of the internet to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime perpetrators of fraud hackers terrorists activists formal and informal instrumentalities of foreign governments and other external parties In addition our customers access our products and services using computers smartphones tablets and other mobile devices that are beyond our security control systems The methods and techniques employed by perpetrators of fraud and others to attack disable degrade or sabotage platforms systems and applications change frequently are increasingly sophisticated and often are not fully recognized or understood until after they have occurred and some techniques could occur and persist for an extended period of time before being detected For example although we immediately fixed the configuration vulnerability that was exploited in the Cybersecurity Incident once we discovered the unauthorized access a period of time elapsed between the occurrence of the unauthorized access and the time when we discovered it In other circumstances we and our thirdparty service providers and partners may be unable to anticipate or identify certain attack methods in order to implement effective preventative measures or mitigate or remediate the damages caused in a 22 Capital One Financial Corporation COF Table of Contents timely manner We may also be unable to hire and develop talent capable of detecting mitigating or remediating these risks Although we seek to maintain a robust suite of authentication and layered information security controls including our cyber threat analytics data encryption and tokenization technologies antimalware defenses and vulnerability management program any one or combination of these controls could fail to detect mitigate or remediate these risks in a timely manner We will likely face an increasing number of attempted cyberattacks as we expand our mobile and other internetbased products and services as well as our usage of mobile and cloud technologies and as we provide more of these services to a greater number of retail clients A disruption or breach including as a result of a cyberattack such as the Cybersecurity Incident or media reports of perceived security vulnerabilities at Capital One or at thirdparty service providers could result in significant legal and financial exposure regulatory intervention litigation and remediation costs card reissuance supervisory liability damage to our reputation or loss of confidence in the security of our systems products and services that could adversely affect our business We and other US financial services providers continue to be targeted with evolving and adaptive cybersecurity threats from sophisticated third parties We are continuing to assess the impact of the Cybersecurity Incident and there can be no assurance that additional unauthorized access or cyber incidents will not occur or that we will not suffer material losses in the future Unauthorized access or cybersecurity incidents could occur more frequently and on a more significant scale If future attacks like these are successful or if customers are unable to access their accounts online for other reasons it could adversely impact our ability to service customer accounts or loans complete financial transactions for our customers or otherwise operate any of our businesses or services In addition a breach or attack affecting one of our thirdparty service providers or partners could harm our business even if we do not control the service that is attacked In addition the increasing prevalence and the evolution of cyberattacks and other efforts to breach or disrupt our systems or those of our partners retailers or other market participants has led and will likely continue to lead to increased costs to us with respect to preventing mitigating and remediating these risks as well as any related attempted fraud In order to address ongoing and future risks including from the Cybersecurity Incident we must expend significant resources to support protective security measures investigate and remediate any vulnerabilities of our information systems and infrastructure and invest in new technology designed to mitigate security risks The Cybersecurity Incident or successful cyberattacks at other large financial institutions or other market participants whether or not we are impacted could lead to a general loss of customer confidence in financial institutions that could negatively affect us including harming the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures or the financial system in general which could result in reduced use of our financial products We have insurance against some cyberrisks and attacks including insurance that is expected to cover certain costs associated with the Cybersecurity Incident nonetheless our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to offset the impact of a material loss event and such insurance may increase in cost or cease to be available on commercial terms in the future Potential data protection and privacy incidents and our required compliance with regulations related to these areas may increase our costs reduce our revenue and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities A breach failure or other disruption of our information systems or infrastructure or data management processes or those of our customers partners service providers or other market participants could lead depending on the nature of the incident to the unauthorized or unintended access to and release gathering monitoring misuse loss or destruction of personal or confidential data about our customers employees or other third parties in our possession Any party that obtains this personal or confidential data through a breach or disruption may use this information for ransom to be paid by us or a thirdparty as part of a fraudulent activity that is part of a broader criminal activity or for other illicit purposes Further such disruption or breach could also result in unauthorized access to our proprietary information intellectual property software methodologies and business secrets and in unauthorized transactions in Capital One accounts or unauthorized access to personal or confidential information maintained by those entities There has been a significant proliferation of consumer information available on the internet resulting from breaches of thirdparty entities including personal information login credentials and authentication data While we were not directly involved in these thirdparty breach events the stolen information can create a vulnerability for our customers if their Capital One login credentials are the same as or similar to the credentials that have been compromised on other sites This vulnerability could include the risk of unauthorized account access data loss and fraud The use of artificial intelligence bots or other automation software can increase the velocity and efficacy of these types of attacks We are continuing to assess the impact of the Cybersecurity Incident The Cybersecurity Incident other data security incidents we may experience in the future or media reports of perceived security vulnerabilities at Capital One or at thirdparty service providers could result in significant legal and financial exposure regulatory intervention remediation costs card reissuance supervisory liability damage to our reputation or loss of confidence in the security of our systems products and services that could adversely affect our business 23 Capital One Financial Corporation COF Table of Contents We are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations in the United States and abroad regarding privacy data protection and data security including those related to the collection storage handling use disclosure transfer and security of personal data Significant uncertainty exists as privacy and data protection laws may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements For example in Canada we are subject to the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act PIPEDA In addition the General Data Protection Regulation GDPR applies EU data protection law to all companies processing data of EU residents regardless of the companys location More recently on January 1 2020 the CCPA went into effect for companies doing business in California These laws impose strict requirements regarding the collection storage handling use disclosure transfer and security of personal data which may have adverse consequences including severe monetary penalties Our efforts to comply with PIPEDA GDPR CCPA and other privacy and data protection laws entail substantial expenses may divert resources from other initiatives and projects and could limit the services we are able to offer Furthermore enforcement actions and investigations by regulatory authorities related to data security incidents and privacy violations continue to increase The enactment of more restrictive laws rules regulations or future enforcement actions or investigations could impact us through increased costs or restrictions on our business and noncompliance could result in monetary or other penalties and significant legal liability We face risks resulting from the extensive use of models and data We rely on quantitative models and our ability to manage data and aggregate data in an accurate and timely manner assess and manage our various risk exposures estimate certain financial values and manage compliance with required regulatory capital requirements Models may be used in such processes as determining the pricing of various products grading loans and extending credit measuring interest rate and other market risks predicting deposit levels or loan losses assessing capital adequacy and calculating economic and regulatory capital levels estimate the value of financial instruments and balance sheet items and other operational functions Our risk reporting and management including business decisions based on information incorporating models depend on the effectiveness of our models and our policies programs processes and practices governing how data is acquired validated stored protected processed and analyzed Any issues with the quality or effectiveness of our data aggregation and validation procedures as well as the quality and integrity of data inputs formulas or algorithms could result in inaccurate forecasts ineffective risk management practices or inaccurate risk reporting In addition models based on historical data sets might not be accurate predictors of future outcomes and their ability to appropriately predict future outcomes may degrade over time While we continuously update our policies programs processes and practices many of our data management aggregation and implementation processes are manual and subject to human error or system failure Failure to manage data effectively and to aggregate data in an accurate and timely manner may limit our ability to manage current and emerging risk to produce accurate financial regulatory and operational reporting as well as to manage changing business needs If our risk management framework is ineffective we could suffer unexpected losses which could materially adversely affect our results of operation or financial condition Also any information we provide to the public or to our regulators based on poorly designed or implemented models could be inaccurate or misleading Some of the decisions that our regulators make including those related to capital distribution to our stockholders could be affected adversely due to the perception that the quality of the models used to generate the relevant information is insufficient Legal Risk Our businesses are subject to the risk of increased litigation government investigations and regulatory enforcement Our businesses are subject to increased litigation government investigations and other regulatory enforcement risks as a result of a number of factors and from various sources including the highly regulated nature of the financial services industry the focus of state and federal prosecutors on banks and the financial services industry and the structure of the credit card industry Given the inherent uncertainties involved in litigation government investigations and regulatory enforcement decisions and the very large or indeterminate damages sought in some matters asserted against us there can be significant uncertainty as to the ultimate liability we may incur from these kinds of matters The finding or even the assertion of substantial legal liability against us could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition and could cause significant reputational harm to us which could seriously harm our business The Cybersecurity Incident has resulted in litigation government investigations and other regulatory enforcement inquiries In addition financial institutions such as ourselves face significant regulatory scrutiny which can lead to public enforcement actions We and our subsidiaries are subject to comprehensive regulation and periodic examination by the Federal Reserve the SEC OCC FDIC and CFPB We have been subject to enforcement actions by many of these and other regulators and may continue to be involved in such actions including governmental inquiries investigations and enforcement proceedings including by the OCC Department of Justice Financial Crimes Enforcement Network FinCEN and state Attorneys General 24 Capital One Financial Corporation COF Table of Contents We expect that regulators and governmental enforcement bodies will continue taking formal enforcement actions against financial institutions in addition to addressing supervisory concerns through nonpublic supervisory actions or findings which could involve restrictions on our activities among other limitations that could adversely affect our business In addition a violation of law or regulation by another financial institution is likely to give rise to an investigation by regulators and other governmental agencies of the same or similar practices by us Furthermore a single event may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and proceedings These and other initiatives from governmental authorities and officials may subject us to further judgments settlements fines or penalties or cause us to restructure our operations and activities or to cease offering certain products or services all of which could harm our reputation or lead to higher operational costs Litigation government investigations and other regulatory actions could involve restrictions on our activities generally subject us to significant fines increased expenses restrictions on our activities and damage to our reputation and our brand and could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations For additional information regarding legal and regulatory proceedings that we are subject to see  Note 18Commitments Contingencies Guarantees and Others  Other Business Risks We face intense competition in all of our markets We operate in a highly competitive environment whether in making loans attracting deposits or in the global payments industry and we expect competitive conditions to continue to intensify with respect to most of our products We compete on the basis of the rates we pay on deposits and the rates and other terms we charge on the loans we originate or purchase as well as the quality and range of our customer service products innovation and experience This increasingly competitive environment is primarily a result of changes in technology product delivery systems and regulation as well as the emergence of new or significantly larger financial services providers all of which may affect our customers expectations and demands In addition to offering competitive products and services we invest in and conduct marketing campaigns to attract and inform customers Some of our competitors including new and emerging competitors in the digital and mobile payments space and other financial technology providers are not subject to the same regulatory requirements or legislative scrutiny to which we are subject which also could place us at a competitive disadvantage in particular in the development of new technology platforms or the ability to rapidly innovate We compete with many forms of payments offered by both bank and nonbank providers including a variety of new and evolving alternative payment mechanisms systems and products such as aggregators and webbased and wireless payment platforms or technologies digital or crypto currencies prepaid systems and payment services targeting users of social networks communications platforms and online gaming If we are unable to continue to keep pace with innovation do not effectively market our products and services or are prohibited from or unwilling to enter emerging areas of competition our business and results of operations could be adversely affected Some of our competitors are substantially larger than we are which may give those competitors advantages including a more diversified product and customer base the ability to reach more customers and potential customers operational efficiencies broadbased local distribution capabilities lowercost funding and larger existing branch networks Many of our competitors are also focusing on crossselling their products and developing new products or technologies which could affect our ability to maintain or grow existing customer relationships or require us to offer lower interest rates or fees on our lending products or higher interest rates on deposits Competition for loans could result in origination of fewer loans earning less on our loans or an increase in loans that perform below expectations As of December 31 2019 we operate as one of the largest online direct banks in the United States by deposits While direct banking provides a significant opportunity to attract new customers that value greater and more flexible access to banking services at reduced costs we face strong and increasing competition in the direct banking market Aggressive pricing throughout the industry may adversely affect the retention of existing balances and the costefficient acquisition of new deposit funds and may affect our growth and profitability Customers could also close their online accounts or reduce balances or deposits in favor of products and services offered by competitors for other reasons These shifts which could be rapid could result from general dissatisfaction with our products or services including concerns over pricing online security or our reputation The potential consequences of this competitive environment are exacerbated by the flexibility of direct banking and the financial and technological sophistication of our online customer base In our credit card business competition for rewards customers may result in higher rewards expenses or we may fail to attract new customers or retain existing rewards customers due to increasing competition for these consumers We have expanded the loan portfolio in our partnership business with the additions of a number of large partnerships The market for key business partners especially in the credit card business is very competitive and we may not be able to grow or maintain these partner relationships 25 Capital One Financial Corporation COF Table of Contents We face the risk that we could lose partner relationships even after we have invested significant resources time and expense into acquiring and developing the relationships The loss of any of our key business partners could have a negative impact on our results of operations including lower returns excess operating expense and excess funding capacity We depend on our partners to effectively promote our cobrand and private label products and integrate the use of our credit cards into their retail operations The failure by our partners to effectively promote and support our products as well as changes they may make in their business models could adversely affect card usage and our ability to achieve the growth and profitability objectives of our partnerships In addition if our partners do not adhere to the terms of our program agreements and standards or otherwise diminish the value of our brand we may suffer reputational damage and customers may be less likely to use our products Some of our competitors have developed or may develop substantially greater financial and other resources than we have may offer richer value propositions or a wider range of programs and services than we offer or may use more effective advertising marketing or crossselling strategies to acquire and retain more customers capture a greater share of spending and borrowings attain and develop more attractive cobrand card programs and maintain greater merchant acceptance than we have We may not be able to compete effectively against these threats or respond or adapt to changes in consumer spending habits as effectively as our competitors In such a competitive environment we may lose entire accounts or may lose account balances to competing firms or we may find it more costly to maintain our existing customer base Customer attrition from any or all of our lending products together with any lowering of interest rates or fees that we might implement to retain customers could reduce our revenues and therefore our earnings Similarly unexpected customer attrition from our deposit products in addition to an increase in rates or services that we may offer to retain deposits may increase our expenses and therefore reduce our earnings Our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by merchants increasing focus on the fees charged by credit card networks and by regulation and legislation impacting such fees Credit card interchange fees are generally one of the largest components of the costs that merchants pay in connection with the acceptance of credit cards and are a meaningful source of revenue for our credit card businesses Interchange fees are the subject of significant and intense global legal regulatory and legislative focus and the resulting decisions regulations and legislation may have a material adverse impact on our overall business financial condition and results of operations Regulators and legislative bodies in a number of countries are seeking to reduce credit card interchange fees through legislation competitionrelated regulatory proceedings central bank regulation and or litigation Interchange reimbursement rates in the United States are set by credit card networks such as MasterCard and Visa In some jurisdictions such as Canada and certain countries in the EU interchange fees and related practices are subject to regulatory activity that has limited the ability of certain networks to establish default rates including in some cases imposing caps on permissible interchange fees We have already experienced these impacts in our international card businesses Legislators and regulators around the world are aware of each others approaches to the regulation of the payments industry Consequently a development in one country state or region may influence regulatory approaches in another such as our primary market the United States In addition to this regulatory activity merchants are also seeking avenues to reduce interchange fees During the past few years merchants and their trade groups have filed numerous lawsuits against Visa MasterCard American Express and their cardissuing banks claiming that their practices toward merchants including interchange and similar fees violate federal antitrust laws In 2005 a number of entities filed antitrust lawsuits against MasterCard and Visa and several member banks including our subsidiaries and us alleging among other things that the defendants conspired to fix the level of interchange fees In December 2013 the US District Court for the Eastern District of New York granted final approval of the proposed class settlement The settlement provided among other things that merchants would be entitled to join together to negotiate lower interchange fees The settlement was appealed to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals which rejected the settlement in June 2016 a revised settlement was reached in the second half of 2018 and the trial court issued its final approval of the settlement in December 2019 See  Note 18Commitments Contingencies Guarantees and Others  for further details Some major retailers may have sufficient bargaining power to independently negotiate lower interchange fees with MasterCard and Visa which could in turn result in lower interchange fees for us when our cardholders undertake purchase transactions with these retailers In 2016 some of the largest merchants individually negotiated lower interchange rates with MasterCard andor Visa These and other merchants also continue to lobby aggressively for caps and restrictions on interchange fees and their efforts may be successful or they may in the future bring legal proceedings against us or other credit card and debit card issuers and networks 26 Capital One Financial Corporation COF Table of Contents Beyond pursuing litigation legislation and regulation merchants may also promote forms of payment with lower fees such as ACHbased payments or seek to impose surcharges at the point of sale for use of credit or debit cards New payment systems particularly mobilebased payment technologies could also gain widespread adoption and lead to issuer transaction fees or the displacement of credit card accounts as a payment method The heightened focus by merchants and regulatory and legislative bodies on the fees charged by credit and debit card networks and the ability of certain merchants to successfully negotiate discounts to interchange fees with MasterCard and Visa or develop alternative payment systems could result in a reduction of interchange fees Any resulting loss in income to us could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations If we are not able to invest successfully in and introduce digital and other technological developments across all our businesses our financial performance may suffer Our industry is subject to rapid and significant technological changes and our ability to meet our customers needs and expectations is key to our ability to grow revenue and earnings We expect digital technologies to have a significant impact on banking over time Consumers expect robust digital experiences from their financial services providers The ability for customers to access their accounts and conduct financial transactions using digital technology including mobile applications is an important aspect of the financial services industry and financial institutions are rapidly introducing new digital and other technologydriven products and services that aim to offer a better customer experience and to reduce costs We continue to invest in digital technology designed to attract new customers facilitate the ability of existing customers to conduct financial transactions and enhance the customer experience related to our products and services Our continued success depends in part upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using digital technology to provide products and services that meet their expectations The development and launch of new digital products and services depends in large part on our capacity to invest in and build the technology platforms that can enable them in a cost effective and timely manner See  We face intense competition in all of our markets  and  We face risks related to our operational technological and organizational infrastructure  Some of our competitors are substantially larger than we are which may allow those competitors to invest more money into their technology infrastructure and digital innovation than we do In addition we face intense competition from smaller companies which experience lower cost structures and different regulatory requirements and scrutiny than we do and which may allow them to innovate more rapidly than we can See  We face intense competition in all of our markets  Further our success depends on our ability to attract and retain strong digital and technology leaders engineers and other specialized personnel The competition is intense and the compensation costs continue to increase for such talent If we are unable to attract and retain digital and technology talent our ability to offer digital products and services and build the necessary technology infrastructure could be negatively affected which could negatively impact our business and financial results A failure to maintain or enhance our competitive position with respect to digital products and services whether because we fail to anticipate customer expectations or because our technological developments fail to perform as desired or are not implemented in a timely or successful manner could negatively impact our business and financial results We may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of our mergers acquisitions and strategic partnerships We have engaged in merger and acquisition activity and entered into strategic partnerships over the past several years We continue to evaluate and anticipate engaging in among other merger and acquisition activity additional strategic partnerships and selected acquisitions of financial institutions and other acquisition targets including credit card and other loan portfolios We may not be able to identify and secure future acquisition targets on terms and conditions that are acceptable to us or successfully complete within the anticipated time frame and achieving the anticipated benefits of proposed mergers acquisitions and strategic partnerships which could impair our growth Any merger acquisition or strategic partnership we undertake entails certain risks which may materially and adversely affect our results of operations If we experience greater than anticipated costs to integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations or are not able to achieve the anticipated benefits of any merger acquisition or strategic partnership including cost savings and other synergies our business could be negatively affected In addition it is possible that the ongoing integration processes could result in the loss of key employees errors or delays in systems implementation exposure to cybersecurity risks associated with acquired businesses exposure to additional regulatory oversight the disruption of our ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with partners clients customers depositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of any merger acquisition or strategic partnership 27 Capital One Financial Corporation COF Table of Contents Integration efforts also may divert management attention and resources These integration matters may have an adverse effect on us during any transition period In addition we may face the following risks in connection with any merger acquisition or strategic partnership  New Businesses and Geographic or Other Markets Our merger acquisition or strategic partnership activity may involve our entry into new businesses and new geographic areas or other markets which present risks resulting from our relative inexperience in these new businesses or markets These new businesses or markets may change the overall character of our consolidated portfolio of businesses and alter our exposure to economic and other external factors We face the risk that we will not be successful in these new businesses or in these new markets  Identification and Assessment of Merger and Acquisition Targets and Deployment of Acquired Assets We may not be able to identify acquire or partner with suitable targets Further our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of any merger acquisition or strategic partnership will depend on our ability to assess the asset quality and value of the particular assets or institutions we partner with merge with or acquire We may be unable to profitably deploy any assets we acquire  Accuracy of Assumptions In connection with any merger acquisition or strategic partnership we may make certain assumptions relating to the proposed merger acquisition or strategic partnership that may be or may prove to be inaccurate including as a result of the failure to realize the expected benefits of any merger acquisition or strategic partnership The inaccuracy of any assumptions we may make could result in unanticipated consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition  Targetspecific Risk Assets and companies that we acquire or companies that we enter into strategic partnerships with will have their own risks that are specific to a particular asset or company These risks include but are not limited to particular or specific regulatory accounting operational reputational and industry risks any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition For example we may face challenges associated with integrating other companies due to differences in corporate culture compliance systems or standards of conduct Indemnification rights if any may be insufficient to compensate us for any losses or damages resulting from such risks In addition to regulatory approvals discussed below certain of our merger acquisition or partnership activity may require thirdparty consents in order for us to fully realize the anticipated benefits of any such transaction  Conditions to Regulatory Approval  Certain acquisitions may not be consummated without obtaining approvals from one or more of our regulators We cannot be certain when or if or on what terms and conditions any required regulatory approvals will be granted Consequently we might be required to sell portions of acquired assets or our own assets as a condition to receiving regulatory approval or we may not obtain regulatory approval for a proposed acquisition on acceptable terms or at all in which case we would not be able to complete the acquisition despite the time and expenses invested in pursuing it Reputational risk and social factors may impact our results and damage our brand Our ability to attract and retain customers is highly dependent upon the perceptions of consumer and commercial borrowers and deposit holders and other external perceptions of our products services trustworthiness business practices workplace culture compliance practices or our financial health In addition our brand is very important to us Maintaining and enhancing our brand depends largely on our ability to continue to provide highquality products and services Adverse perceptions regarding our reputation in the consumer commercial and funding markets could lead to difficulties in generating and maintaining accounts as well as in financing them In particular negative public perceptions regarding our reputation including negative perceptions regarding our ability to maintain the security of our technology systems and protect customer data could lead to decreases in the levels of deposits that consumer and commercial customers and potential customers choose to maintain with us or significantly increase the costs of attracting and retaining customers In addition negative perceptions regarding certain industries partners or clients could also prompt us to cease business activities associated with those entities Negative public opinion or damage to our brand could also result from actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities or circumstances including lending practices regulatory compliance security breaches including the use and protection of customer information such as a result of the Cybersecurity Incident corporate governance and sales and marketing and from actions taken by regulators or other persons in response to such conduct Such conduct could fall short of our customers and the publics heightened expectations of companies of our size with rigorous data privacy and compliance practices and could further harm our reputation In addition our cobrand and private label partners or other third parties with whom we have important relationships may take actions over which we have limited control that could negatively impact perceptions about us or the financial services 28 Capital One Financial Corporation COF Table of Contents industry The proliferation of social media may increase the likelihood that negative public opinion from any of the events discussed above will impact our reputation and business In addition a variety of social factors may cause changes in borrowing activity including credit card use payment patterns and the rate of defaults by account holders and borrowers domestically and internationally These social factors include changes in consumer confidence levels the publics perception regarding the banking industry and consumer debt including credit card use and changing attitudes about the stigma of bankruptcy If consumers develop or maintain negative attitudes about incurring debt or if consumption trends decline or if we fail to maintain and enhance our brand or we incur significant expenses to do so our business and financial results could be materially and negatively affected If we are not able to protect our intellectual property our revenue and profitability could be negatively affected We rely on a variety of measures to protect and enhance our intellectual property including copyrights trademarks trade secrets patents and certain restrictions on disclosure solicitation and competition We also undertake other measures to control access to and distribution of our other proprietary information These measures may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information or infringement of our intellectual property rights and a resulting loss of competitive advantage In addition our competitors or other third parties may file patent applications for innovations that are used in our industry or allege that our systems processes or technologies infringe on their intellectual property rights If our competitors or other third parties are successful in obtaining such patents or prevail in intellectual propertyrelated litigation against us we could lose significant revenues incur significant license royalty or technology development expenses or pay significant damages Our risk management strategies may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposures in all market environments or against all types of risk Management of market credit liquidity operational and compliance risk requires among other things policies and procedures to properly record and verify a large number of transactions and events See MDA Risk Management  for further details Even though we continue to devote significant resources to developing our risk management framework our risk management strategies may not be fully effective in identifying and mitigating our risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk including risks that are unidentified or unanticipated Some of our methods of managing these risks are based upon our use of observed historical market behavior and managements judgment These methods may not accurately predict future exposures which could be significantly greater than the historical measures indicate and market conditions particularly during a period of financial market stress can involve unprecedented dislocations Credit risk is inherent in the financial services business and results from among other things extending credit to customers Our ability to assess the creditworthiness of our customers may be impaired if the models and approaches we use to select manage and underwrite our consumer and commercial customers become less predictive of future chargeoffs due for example to rapid changes in the economy including tariff rates and international trade relations While we employ a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and risk mitigation techniques those techniques and the judgments that accompany their application cannot anticipate every economic and financial outcome or the timing of such outcomes For example our ability to implement our risk management strategies may be hindered by adverse changes in the volatility or liquidity conditions in certain markets and as a result may limit our ability to distribute such risks for instance when we seek to syndicate exposure in bridge financing transactions we have underwritten We may therefore incur losses in the course of our risk management or investing activities Changes in consumer behavior and adoption of digital technology may change retail distribution strategies and adversely impact our investments in our bank premises and equipment and other retail distribution assets leading to increased costs and exposure to additional risks We have significant investments in bank premises and equipment for our branch network and other branch banking assets including our banking centers and our retail work force Advances in technology such as digital and mobile banking inbranch selfservice technologies proximity or remote payment technologies as well as changing customer preferences for these other methods of banking could decrease the value of our branch network or other retail distribution assets As a result we will continue to adapt our retail distribution strategy For example we may close sell andor renovate additional branches or parcels of land held for development and restructure or reduce our remaining branches and work force These actions could lead to losses on these assets or could adversely impact the carrying value of other longlived assets reduce our revenues increase our expenditures dilute our brand andor reduce customer demand for our products and services 29 Capital One Financial Corporation COF Table of Contents Further to the extent that we change our retail distribution strategy and as a result expand into new business areas we may face more competitors with more experience in the new business areas and more established relationships with relevant customers regulators and industry participants which could adversely affect our ability to compete Our competitors may also be subject to less burdensome regulations See  We face intense competition in all of our markets  Fluctuations in market interest rates or volatility in the capital markets could adversely affect our income and expense the value of assets and obligations our regulatory capital cost of capital or liquidity Like other financial institutions our business is sensitive to market interest rate movements and the performance of the capital markets Disruptions uncertainty or volatility across the capital markets could negatively impact market liquidity and limit our access to the funding required to operate and grow our business In addition changes in interest rates or in valuations in the debt or equity markets could directly impact us For example we borrow money from other institutions and depositors which we use to make loans to customers and invest in debt securities and other earning assets We earn interest on these loans and assets and pay interest on the money we borrow from institutions and depositors The interest rates that we pay on the securities we have issued are also influenced by among other things applicable credit ratings from recognized rating agencies A downgrade to any of these credit ratings could affect our ability to access the capital markets increase our borrowing costs and have a negative impact on our results of operations Increased chargeoffs rising London Interbank Offering Rate LIBOR or other applicable reference rates and other events may cause our securitization transactions to amortize earlier than scheduled which could accelerate our need for additional funding from other sources Fluctuations in interest rates including changes in the relationship between shortterm rates and longterm rates and in the relationship between our funding basis rate and our lending basis rate may have negative impacts on our net interest income and therefore our earnings In addition interest rate fluctuations and competitor responses to those changes may affect the rate of customer prepayments for auto and other term loans and may affect the balances customers carry on their credit cards For example increases in interest rates increase debt service requirements for some of our borrowers which may adversely affect those borrowers ability to pay as contractually obligated This could result in additional delinquencies or chargeoffs and negatively impact our results of operations These changes can reduce the overall yield on our earning asset portfolio Changes in interest rates and competitor responses to these changes may also impact customer decisions to maintain balances in the deposit accounts they have with us An inability to attract or maintain deposits could materially affect our ability to fund our business and our liquidity position Many other financial institutions have increased their reliance on deposit funding and as such we expect continued competition in the deposit markets We cannot predict how this competition will affect our costs If we are required to offer higher interest rates to attract or maintain deposits our funding costs will be adversely impacted Changes in valuations in the debt and equity markets could have a negative impact on the assets we hold in our investment portfolio Such market changes could also have a negative impact on the valuation of assets for which we provide servicing We assess our interest rate risk by estimating the effect on our earnings economic value and capital under various scenarios that differ based on assumptions about the direction and the magnitude of interest rate changes We take risk mitigation actions based on those assessments We face the risk that changes in interest rates could materially reduce our net interest income and our earnings especially if actual conditions turn out to be materially different than those we assumed See MDA Market Risk Profile  for additional information Uncertainty regarding and transition away from LIBOR may adversely affect our business The UK Financial Conduct Authority which regulates LIBOR has announced that it will no longer compel banks to contribute data for the calculation of LIBOR after December 31 2021 It is likely that banks will no longer continue to contribute submissions for the calculation of LIBOR after that date which creates significant uncertainty around the publication of LIBOR beyond 2021 and whether LIBOR will continue to be viewed as a reliable market benchmark It remains unclear what rate or rates may develop as accepted alternatives to LIBOR or what the effect of such changes will be on the markets for LIBORbased financial instruments The Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR has been recommended by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee as an alternative for USD LIBOR but issues and uncertainty remain with respect to its implementation Given LIBORs extensive use across financial markets the transition away from LIBOR presents several risks and challenges to the financial markets and financial institutions including Capital One We have loans derivative contracts unsecured debt securitizations vendor agreements and other instruments with attributes that are either directly or indirectly dependent on LIBOR Uncertainty as to the nature of potential changes alternative reference rates such as SOFR or other reforms may adversely affect market liquidity the pricing of LIBORbased instruments and the availability and cost of associated hedging instruments and borrowings If SOFR or another rate does not achieve wide acceptance as the alternative to LIBOR there likely will be disruption 30 Capital One Financial Corporation COF Table of Contents to the markets relying on the availability of a broadly accepted reference rate In addition uncertainty regarding LIBOR could result in loss of market share in certain products adverse tax or accounting impacts compliance legal or operational costs and risks associated with client disclosures as well as systems disruption model disruption and other business continuity issues for us Even if SOFR or another reference rate becomes a widely acceptable replacement for LIBOR risks will remain for us with respect to outstanding instruments which rely on LIBOR Those risks arise in connection with transitioning such instruments to a new reference rate the taking of discretionary actions or the negotiation of fallback provisions and final amendments to existing LIBOR based agreements Payments under contracts referencing new reference rates may significantly differ from those referencing LIBOR For some instruments the method of transitioning to a new reference rate may be challenging especially if parties to an instrument cannot agree as to how to effect that transition If a contract is not transitioned to a new reference rate and LIBOR ceases to exist the impact on our obligations is likely to vary by contract In addition prior to LIBOR cessation instruments that continue to refer to LIBOR may be impacted if there is a change in the availability or calculation of LIBOR The transition from LIBOR to an alternative reference rate may change our market risk profile and require changes to risk and pricing models valuation tools product design information technology systems reporting infrastructure operational processes and controls and hedging strategies In many cases we may be dependent on third parties to upgrade systems software and other critical functions that could materially disrupt our readiness if they are not done on a timely basis or otherwise fail Our assessment of the ultimate impact of and our planning for the transition from LIBOR remains ongoing Failure to adequately manage the transition could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition and results of operations See MDA Market Risk Profile  for additional information Our business could be negatively affected if we are unable to attract retain and motivate skilled employees Our success depends in large part on our ability to retain key senior leaders and to attract and retain skilled employees particularly employees with advanced expertise in credit risk and digital and technology skills We depend on our senior leaders and skilled employees to oversee simultaneous transformative initiatives across the enterprise and execute on our business plans in an efficient and effective manner Competition for such senior leaders and employees and the costs associated with attracting and retaining them is high Our ability to attract and retain qualified employees also is affected by perceptions of our culture and management our profile in the regions where we have offices and the professional opportunities we offer Regulation or regulatory guidance restricting executive compensation as well as evolving investor expectations may limit the types of compensation arrangements that we may enter into with our most senior leaders and could have a negative impact on our ability to attract retain and motivate such leaders in support of our longterm strategy These laws and regulations may not apply in the same manner to all financial institutions and we therefore may face more restrictions than other institutions and companies with which we compete for talent These laws and regulations may also hinder our ability to compete for talent with other industries We rely upon our senior leaders not only for business success but also to lead with integrity To the extent our senior leaders behave in a manner that does not comport with our values the consequences to our brand and reputation could be severe and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations If we are unable to attract develop and retain talented senior leadership and employees or to implement appropriate succession plans for our senior leadership our business could be negatively affected We face risks from unpredictable catastrophic events Despite the business contingency plans we have in place such plans do not fully mitigate all potential business continuity risks to us Natural disasters and other catastrophic events could harm our business and infrastructure including our information technology systems and thirdparty platforms Our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our business and the communities where we are located which are concentrated in the Northern Virginia and New York metropolitan areas as well as Richmond Virginia and Plano Texas This may include a disruption involving damage or loss of access to a physical site cyber incidents terrorist activities disease pandemics natural disasters extreme weather events electrical outage environmental hazard technological infrastructure communications or other services we use our employees or third parties with whom we conduct business In addition if a natural disaster or other catastrophic event occurs in certain regions where our business and customers are concentrated such as the midAtlantic New York or Texas metropolitan areas we could be disproportionately impacted as compared to our competitors The impact of such events and other catastrophes on the overall economy may also adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations We face risks from the use of or changes to assumptions or estimates in our financial statements Pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles in the US US GAAP we are required to use certain assumptions and estimates in preparing our financial statements including determining our allowance for loan and lease losses the fair value of 31 Capital One Financial Corporation COF Table of Contents certain assets and liabilities and asset impairment among other items In addition the FASB the SEC and other regulatory bodies may change the financial accounting and reporting standards including those related to assumptions and estimates we use to prepare our financial statements in ways that we cannot predict and that could impact our financial statements For example as of January 1 2020 we are required to apply the CECL model based on expected lifetime losses rather than incurred losses which will increase the impact of estimates on our reported results If actual results differ from the assumptions or estimates underlying our financial statements or if financial accounting and reporting standards are changed we may experience unexpected material losses For a discussion of our use of estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements see MDA Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  and  Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  Limitations on our ability to receive dividends from our subsidiaries could affect our liquidity and ability to pay dividends and repurchase common stock We are a separate and distinct legal entity from our subsidiaries including the Banks Dividends to us from our direct and indirect subsidiaries including the Banks have represented a major source of funds for us to pay dividends on our common and preferred stock repurchase common stock make payments on corporate debt securities and meet other obligations There are various federal law limitations on the extent to which the Banks can finance or otherwise supply funds to us through dividends and loans These limitations include minimum regulatory capital requirements federal banking law requirements concerning the payment of dividends out of net profits or surplus Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation W governing transactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliates as well as general federal regulatory oversight to prevent unsafe or unsound practices If our subsidiaries earnings are not sufficient to make dividend payments to us while maintaining adequate capital levels our liquidity may be affected and we may not be able to make dividend payments to our common or preferred stockholders repurchase our common stock make payments on outstanding corporate debt securities or meet other obligations each and any of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial position or perception of financial health The soundness of other financial institutions and other third parties could adversely affect us Our ability to engage in routine funding and other transactions could be adversely affected by the stability and actions of other financial services institutions Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading clearing servicing counterparty and other relationships We have exposure to financial institutions intermediaries and counterparties that are exposed to risks over which we have little or no control In addition we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients resulting in a significant credit concentration with respect to the financial services industry overall As a result defaults by or even rumors or questions about one or more financial services institutions or the financial services industry generally have led to marketwide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions Likewise adverse developments affecting the overall strength and soundness of our competitors the financial services industry as a whole and the general economic climate or sovereign debt could have a negative impact on perceptions about the strength and soundness of our business even if we are not subject to the same adverse developments In addition adverse developments with respect to third parties with whom we have important relationships also could negatively impact perceptions about us These perceptions about us could cause our business to be negatively affected and exacerbate the other risks that we face Item 1B Unresolved Staff Comments None Item 2 Properties
