personal information relating to people who had applied for our credit card products and to our credit card customers the Cybersecurity Incident We retained a leading independent cybersecurity firm that confirmed we correctly identified and fixed the specific configuration vulnerability exploited in the Cybersecurity Incident We continue to invest significantly in cybersecurity and related risk management activities and expect to make additional investments as we continue to assess our cybersecurity program During the year ended December 31 2020 we incurred 66 million of incremental expenses related to the remediation of and response to the Cybersecurity Incident offset by 39 million of insurance recoveries To date we have incurred 138 million of incremental expenses offset by 73 million of insurance recoveries pursuant to the cyber risk insurance coverage we carry These expenses mainly consist of customer notifications credit monitoring technology costs and professional and legal support We expect any further expenses net of insurance to be immaterial in future periods We carry insurance to cover certain costs associated with a cyber risk event This insurance has a total coverage limit of 400 million and is subject to a 10 million deductible which was met in the third quarter of 2019 as well as standard exclusions The expenses discussed in this paragraph do not

other borrowings We also earn noninterest income which primarily consists of interchange income net of reward expenses service charges and other customerrelated fees Our expenses primarily consist of the provision for credit losses operating expenses marketing expenses and income taxes Our principal operations are organized for management reporting purposes into three major business segments which are defined primarily based on the products and services provided or the types of customers served Credit Card Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking The operations of acquired businesses have been integrated into or managed as a part of our existing business segments Certain activities that are not part of a segment such as management of our corporate investment portfolio assetliability

MDAExecutive Summary and Business Outlook MDABusiness Segment Financial Performance and Note 17Business Segments and Revenue from Contracts with Customers of this Report 7 Capital One Financial Corporation COF Table of Contents COMPETITION Each of our business segments operates in a highly competitive environment and we face competition in all aspects of our business from numerous bank and nonbank providers of financial services Our Credit Card business competes with international national regional and local issuers of Visa and MasterCard credit cards as well as with American Express   Discover Card   privatelabel card brands and to a certain extent issuers of debit cards In general customers are attracted to credit card issuers largely on the basis of price credit limit reward programs and other product features Our Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking businesses compete with national state and direct banks for deposits commercial and auto loans as well as with savings and loan associations and credit unions for loans and deposits Our competitors also include automotive finance companies commercial mortgage banking companies and other financial services providers that provide loans deposits and other similar services and products In addition we compete against nondepository institutions that are able to offer these products and services We also consider new and emerging companies in the digital and mobile payments space and other financial technology providers among our competitors We compete with many forms of payment mechanisms systems and products offered by both bank and nonbank providers Our businesses generally compete on the basis of the quality and range of their products and services transaction execution innovation and price Competition varies based on the types of clients customers industries and geographies served Our ability to compete depends in part on our ability to attract and retain our associates and on our reputation as well as our ability to keep pace with innovation in particular in the development of new technology platforms There can be no assurance however that our ability to market products and services successfully or to obtain adequate returns on our products and services will not be impacted by the nature of the competition that now exists or may later develop or by the broader economic environment For a discussion of the risks related to our competitive environment see Part IItem 1A Risk Factors SUPERVISION AND REGULATION The regulatory framework applicable to banking organizations is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the stability of the US financial system rather than for the protection of shareholders and creditors As a banking organization we are subject to extensive regulation and supervision In addition to banking laws and regulations we are subject to various other laws and regulations all of which directly or indirectly affect our operations and management and our ability to make distributions to shareholders We and our subsidiaries are also subject to supervision and examination by multiple regulators In addition to laws and regulations state and federal bank regulatory agencies may issue policy statements interpretive letters and similar written guidance applicable to us and our subsidiaries Any change in the statutes regulations or regulatory policies applicable to us including changes in their interpretation or implementation could have a material effect on our business or organization Both the scope of the laws and regulations and the intensity of the supervision to which we are subject have increased in recent years initially in response to the financial crisis and more recently in light of other factors such as technological political and market changes Regulatory enforcement and fines have also increased across the banking and financial services sector The descriptions below summarize certain significant state and federal laws to which we are subject The descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the particular statutory or regulatory provisions summarized They do not summarize all possible or proposed changes in current laws or regulations and are not intended to be a substitute for the related statues or regulatory provisions Banking Regulation Capital One

supervision examination and regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System Federal Reserve Permissible activities for a BHC include those activities that are so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto In addition an FHC is permitted to engage in activities 8 Capital One Financial Corporation COF Table of Contents considered to be financial in nature including for example securities underwriting and dealing and merchant banking activities incidental to financial activities or if the Federal Reserve determines that they pose no risk to the safety or soundness of depository institutions or the financial system in general activities complementary to financial activities To become and remain eligible for FHC status a BHC and its subsidiary depository institutions must meet certain criteria including capital management and Community Reinvestment Act CRA requirements Failure to meet such criteria could result depending on which requirements were not met in restrictions on new financial activities or acquisitions or being required to discontinue existing activities that are not generally permissible for BHCs The Banks are national associations chartered under the National Bank Act and the deposits of which are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund DIF of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC up to applicable limits The Banks are subject to comprehensive regulation and periodic examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency OCC the FDIC and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau CFPB We are

Institutions We also face regulation in the international jurisdictions in which we conduct business See Regulation of Businesses by Authorities Outside the United States below for additional details Regulation of Business Activities The business activities of the Company and the Banks are also subject to regulation and supervision under various laws and regulations Regulations of Consumer Lending Activities The activities of the Banks as consumer lenders are subject to regulation under various federal laws including for example the Truth in Lending Act TILA the Equal Credit Opportunity Act the Fair Credit Reporting Act the CRA the DoddFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 DoddFrank Act the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act and the Military Lending Act as well as under various state laws TILA as amended imposes a number of restrictions on credit card practices impacting rates and fees requires that a consumers ability to pay be taken into account before issuing credit or increasing credit limits and imposes revised disclosures required for openend credit Depending on the underlying issue and applicable law regulators may be authorized to impose penalties for violations of these statutes and in certain cases to order banks to compensate customers Borrowers may also have a private right of action for certain violations Federal bankruptcy and state debtor relief and collection laws may also affect the ability of a bank including the Banks to collect outstanding balances owed by borrowers Debit Interchange Fees The DoddFrank Act requires that the amount of any interchange fee received by a debit card issuer with respect to debit card transactions be reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the issuer with respect to the transaction Rules adopted by the Federal Reserve to implement these requirements limit interchange fees per debit card transaction to 021 plus five basis points of the transaction amount and provide for an additional 001 fraud prevention adjustment to the interchange fee for issuers that meet certain fraud prevention requirements Privacy Data Protection and Cybersecurity We are subject to multiple federal and state laws concerning privacy data protection and cybersecurity such as the GrammLeach Bliley Act GLBA This area has seen an increase in legislative and regulatory activity over the past several years For example in 2018 the State of California passed the California Consumer Privacy Act CCPA which became effective on January 1 2020 The CCPA and its implementing regulations as recently amended by the California Privacy Rights Act create obligations on covered companies to among other things share certain information they have collected about individuals who are California residents with those individuals subject to some exceptions In addition in December 2020 the Federal Reserve OCC and FDIC collectively the Federal Banking Agencies issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that among other things would require a banking organization to notify its primary federal regulators within 36 hours after identifying a computersecurity incident that the banking organization believes in good faith 9 Capital One Financial Corporation COF Table of Contents could materially disrupt degrade or impair its business or operations in a manner that would among other things jeopardize the viability of its operations result in customers being unable to access their deposit and other accounts result in a material loss of revenue profit or franchise value or pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States We continue to monitor data privacy and cybersecurity legal developments in the jurisdictions in which we do business For further discussion of privacy data protection and cybersecurity and related risks for our business see Part IItem 1A Risk Factors under the headings We face risks related to our operational technological and organizational infrastructure Theft loss or misuse of information as a result of a cyberattack may result in increased costs reductions in revenue reputational damage and business disruptions and Potential data protection and privacy incidents and our required compliance with laws and regulations related to these areas may increase our costs result in legal liability reduce our revenue and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities AntiMoney Laundering and AntiTerrorism The Bank Secrecy Act and the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 Patriot Act require financial institutions among other things to implement a riskbased program reasonably designed to prevent money laundering and to combat the financing of terrorism including through suspicious activity and currency transaction reporting compliance recordkeeping and customer due diligence The Patriot Act also contains financial transparency laws and provides enhanced information collection tools and enforcement mechanisms to the US government including due diligence and recordkeeping requirements for private banking and correspondent accounts standards for verifying customer identification at account opening rules to produce certain records upon request of a regulator or law enforcement agency and rules to promote cooperation among financial institutions regulators and law enforcement agencies in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism money laundering and other crimes The AntiMoney Laundering Act of 2020 AML Act enacted on January 1 2021 as part of the National Defense Authorization Act does not directly impose new requirements on banks but requires the US Treasury Department to issue National AntiMoney Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism Priorities and conduct studies and issue regulations that may over the next few years significantly alter some of the due diligence recordkeeping and reporting requirements that the Bank Secrecy Act and Patriot Act impose on banks The AML Act also contains provisions that promote increased informationsharing and use of technology and increases penalties for violations of the Bank Secrecy Act and includes whistleblower incentives both of which could increase the prospect of regulatory enforcement Funding Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 FDICIA as discussed in MDALiquidity Risk Profile only well capitalized and adequately capitalized institutions may accept brokered deposits Adequately capitalized institutions however must obtain a waiver from the FDIC before accepting brokered deposits and such institutions may not pay rates that significantly exceed the rates paid on deposits of similar maturity obtained from the institutions normal market area or for deposits obtained from outside the institutions normal market area the national rate on deposits of comparable maturity In December 2020 the FDIC finalized amendments to the brokered deposit regulation that among other things generally clarify and narrow the scope of the deposit broker definition The amendments become effective April 1 2021 The FDIC is authorized to terminate a banks deposit insurance upon a finding by the FDIC that the banks financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or has violated any applicable rule regulation order or condition enacted or imposed by the banks regulatory agency

dealer CONA provisionally registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission the CFTC as a swap dealer in the third quarter of 2020 Registration as a swap dealer subjects CONA to additional regulatory requirements with respect to its swaps and other derivatives activities As a result of CONAs swap dealer registration it is subject to the rules of the OCC concerning capital and margin requirements for swap dealers including the mandatory exchange of variation margin and initial margin with certain counterparties Additionally as a provisionally registered swap dealer CONA is subject to requirements under the CFTCs regulatory regime including rules regarding business conduct standards recordkeeping obligations regulatory reporting and procedures relating to swaps trading CONAs swaps and other derivatives activities do not require it to register with the SEC as a securitybased swap dealer Transactions with Affiliates There are various legal restrictions on the extent to which we and our nonbank subsidiaries may borrow or otherwise engage in certain types of transactions with the Banks Under the Federal Reserve Act and Federal Reserve regulations the Banks and their subsidiaries are subject to quantitative and qualitative limits on extensions of credit purchases of assets and certain other transactions involving its nonbank affiliates In addition transactions between the Banks and their nonbank affiliates are required to be on arms length terms and must be consistent with standards of safety and soundness Volcker Rule We and each of our subsidiaries including the Banks are subject to the Volcker Rule a provision of the DoddFrank Act that contains prohibitions on proprietary trading and certain investments in and relationships with covered funds hedge funds private equity funds and similar funds subject to certain exemptions in each case as the applicable terms are defined in the Volcker Rule and the implementing regulations The implementing regulations also require that we establish and maintain a compliance program designed to ensure adherence with the requirements of the regulations Capital and Liquidity Regulation The Company and the Banks are subject to capital adequacy guidelines adopted by the Federal Reserve and OCC respectively For a further discussion of the capital adequacy guidelines see MDACapital Management MDALiquidity Risk Profile and Note 11Regulatory and Capital Adequacy Basel III and United States Capital Rules The Company and the Banks are subject to the regulatory capital requirements established by the Federal Reserve and the OCC respectively the Basel III Capital Rules The Basel III Capital Rules implement certain capital and liquidity requirements published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision Basel Committee along with certain DoddFrank Act and other capital provisions Under the Basel III Capital Rules we must maintain a minimum common equity Tier 1 CET1 capital ratio of 45 a Tier 1 capital ratio of 60 and a total capital ratio of 80 in each case in relation to riskweighted assets In addition we must maintain a minimum leverage ratio of 4 and a minimum supplementary leverage ratio of 3 We are also subject to the capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer requirements as described below In July 2019 the Federal Banking Agencies finalized certain changes to the Basel III Capital Rules for institutions not subject to the Basel III Advanced Approaches Capital Simplification Rule These changes effective January 1 2020 generally raised the threshold above which a covered institution such as the Company must deduct certain assets from its CET1 capital including certain deferred tax assets mortgage servicing assets and investments in unconsolidated financial institutions In October 2019 the Federal Banking Agencies amended the Basel III Capital Rules to provide for tailored application of certain capital requirements across different categories of banking institutions Tailoring Rules These categories are determined primarily by an institutions asset size with adjustments to a more stringent category possible if the institution exceeds certain riskbased thresholds As a BHC with total consolidated assets of at least 250 billion that does not exceed any 11 Capital One Financial Corporation COF Table of Contents of the applicable riskbased thresholds we are a Category III institution under the Tailoring Rules Therefore effective January 1 2020 we were no longer subject to the Basel III Advanced Approaches framework and certain associated capital requirements such as the requirement to include certain elements of accumulated other comprehensive income AOCI in our regulatory capital We remain subject to the countercyclical capital buffer requirement which is currently set at 0 and supplementary leverage ratio requirement which were previously required only for Basel III Advanced Approaches institutions Effective as of the first quarter of 2020 we excluded certain elements of AOCI from our regulatory capital as permitted by the Tailoring Rules The Tailoring Rules and Capital Simplification Rule have taken together decreased our capital requirements Global systemically important banks GSIBs that are based in the US are subject to an additional CET1 capital requirement GSIB Surcharge We are not a GSIB based on the most recent available data and thus we are not subject to a GSIB Surcharge Stress Capital Buffer Rule The Basel III Capital Rules also require banking institutions to maintain a capital conservation buffer composed of CET1 capital above the regulatory minimum ratios The capital conservation buffer for BHCs was previously fixed at 25 In March 2020 the Federal Reserve issued a final rule to implement the stress capital buffer requirement Stress Capital Buffer Rule The stress capital buffer requirement is institutionspecific and replaces the fixed 25 capital conservation buffer for BHCs Pursuant to the Stress Capital Buffer Rule the Federal Reserve will use the results of its supervisory stress test to determine the size of a BHCs stress capital buffer requirement In particular a BHCs stress capital buffer requirement will equal subject to a floor of 25 the sum of i the difference between the BHCs starting CET1 capital ratio and its lowest projected CET1 capital ratio under the severely adverse scenario of the Federal Reserves supervisory stress test plus ii the ratio of the BHCs projected four quarters of common stock dividends for the fourth to seventh quarters of the planning horizon to the projected riskweighted assets for the quarter in which the BHCs projected CET1 capital ratio reaches its minimum under the supervisory stress test Under the Stress Capital Buffer Rule framework the Companys new standardized approach capital conservation buffer includes its stress capital buffer requirement which will be recalibrated every year based on the Companys supervisory stress test results any GSIB surcharge which is not applicable to us and the countercyclical capital buffer requirement which is currently set at 0 Any determination to increase the countercyclical capital buffer generally would be effective twelve months after the announcement of such an increase unless the Federal Banking Agencies set an earlier effective date The Stress Capital Buffer Rule does not apply to the Banks The capital conservation buffer for the Banks continues to be fixed at 25 If we fail to maintain our capital ratios above the minimum capital requirements plus the applicable buffer requirements we will face increasingly strict automatic limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to certain executive officers Under the Basel III Capital Rules if a banking institutions capital ratios fall within its buffer requirements the maximum amount of capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments it can make is a function of its eligible retained income In March 2020 the Federal Banking Agencies revised the definition of eligible retained income in their respective capital rules Under the revised definition of eligible retained income any such automatic limitations on capital distributions would apply in a less severe and more gradual manner than would otherwise have occurred under the previous definition of that term This change was made in response to the COVID19 pandemic to support banking organizations that choose to use their capital and liquidity buffers to lend and undertake other actions that support economic activity in a safe and sound manner CECL Transition Rule As part of the response to the COVID19 pandemic the Federal Banking Agencies adopted a final rule 2020 CECL Transition Rule that provides banking institutions an optional fiveyear transition period to phase in the impact of the CECL standard on their regulatory capital the 2020 CECL Transition Election Pursuant to the 2020 CECL Transition Rule a banking institution may elect to delay the estimated impact of adopting CECL on its regulatory capital through December 31 2021 and then phase in the estimated cumulative impact from January 1 2022 through December 31 2024 For the day 2 ongoing impact of CECL during the initial two years the Federal Banking Agencies use a uniform scaling factor of 25 as an approximation of the increase in the allowance under the CECL standard 12 Capital One Financial Corporation COF Table of Contents compared to the prior incurred loss methodology Accordingly from January 1 2020 through December 31 2021 electing banking institutions are permitted to add back to their regulatory capital an amount equal to the sum of the aftertax day 1 CECL adoption impact and 25 of the increase in the allowance since the adoption of the CECL standard Beginning January 1 2022 through December 31 2024 the aftertax day 1 CECL adoption impact and the cumulative day 2 ongoing impact will be phased in to regulatory capital at 25 per year The following table summarizes the capital impact delay and phase in period on our regulatory capital from years 2020 to 2025 Capital Impact Delayed Phase In Period 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 Day 1 CECL adoption impact Capital impact delayed to 2022 25 Phased In 50 Phased In 75 Phased In Fully Phased In Cumulative day 2 ongoing impact 25 scaling factor as an approximation of the increase in allowance under CECL We adopted the CECL standard for accounting purposes as of January 1 2020 and made the 2020 CECL Transition Election for regulatory capital purposes in the first quarter of 2020 Temporary Exclusions for Supplementary Leverage Ratio In addition in April 2020 as part of the response to the COVID19 pandemic the Federal Reserve issued an interim final rule that temporarily excludes US Treasury securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks from the calculation of the supplementary leverage ratio for BHCs These exclusions became effective on April 1 2020 and will remain in effect through March 31 2021 Subsequently in May 2020 the Federal Banking Agencies issued an interim final rule that provides an option for depository institutions to make similar exclusions to the calculation of the supplementary leverage ratio If a depository institution elects to make such exclusions it must request prior approval from its primary federal banking regulator before making capital distributions such as paying dividends to its parent company for as long as the exclusions are in effect Neither CONA nor COBNA elected to make such exclusions Market Risk Rule The Market Risk Rule supplements the Basel III Capital Rules by requiring institutions subject to the Market Risk Rule to adjust their riskbased capital ratios to reflect the market risk in their trading portfolios The Market Risk Rule generally applies to institutions with aggregate trading assets and liabilities equal to the lesser of 10 or more of total assets or 1 billion or more The Company and CONA are subject to the Market Risk Rule See MDAMarket Risk Profile below for additional information FDICIA and Prompt Corrective Action The FDICIA requires the Federal Banking Agencies to take prompt corrective action for banks that do not meet minimum capital requirements The FDICIA establishes five capital ratio levels well capitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized The three undercapitalized categories are based upon the amount by which a bank falls below the ratios applicable to an adequately capitalized institution The capital categories relate to the FDICIAs prompt corrective action PCA provisions and such capital categories may not constitute an accurate representation of the Banks overall financial condition or prospects The Basel III Capital Rules updated the PCA framework to reflect new higher regulatory capital minimums For an insured depository institution to be well capitalized it must maintain a total riskbased capital ratio of 10 or more a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8 or more a CET1 capital ratio of 65 or more and a leverage ratio of 5 or more An adequately capitalized depository institution must maintain a total riskbased capital ratio of 8 or more a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6 or more a CET1 capital ratio of 45 or more a leverage ratio of 4 or more and for Category III and certain other institutions under the Tailoring Rules a supplementary leverage ratio of 3 or more The PCA provisions also authorize the Federal Banking Agencies to reclassify a banks capital category or take other action against banks that are determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or to have engaged in unsafe or unsound banking practices 13 Capital One Financial Corporation COF Table of Contents As an additional means to identify problems in the financial management of depository institutions the FDICIA required the Federal Banking Agencies to establish certain noncapital safety and soundness standards The standards adopted by the Federal Banking Agencies relate generally to operations and management asset quality interest rate exposure and executive compensation The Federal Banking Agencies are authorized to take action against institutions that fail to meet such standards Basel III and United States Liquidity Rules The Basel Committee has published a liquidity framework that includes two standards for liquidity risk supervision One standard the liquidity coverage ratio LCR seeks to promote shortterm resilience by requiring organizations to hold sufficient highquality liquid assets HQLAs to survive a stress scenario lasting for 30 days The other standard the net stable funding ratio NSFR seeks to promote longerterm resilience by requiring sufficient stable funding over a oneyear period based on the liquidity characteristics of the organizations assets and activities The Company and the Banks are subject to the LCR standard as implemented by the Federal Reserve and OCC the LCR Rule The LCR Rule requires the Company and each of the Banks to hold an amount of eligible HQLA that equals or exceeds 100 of its respective projected adjusted net cash outflows over a 30day period each as calculated in accordance with the LCR Rule The LCR Rule requires us to calculate our LCR daily In addition the Company is required to make quarterly public disclosures of its LCR and certain related quantitative liquidity metrics along with a qualitative discussion of its LCR Under the Tailoring Rules as a Category III institution with less than 75 billion in weighted average shortterm wholesale funding the Companys and the Banks total net cash outflows are multiplied by an outflow adjustment percentage of 85 Although the Banks may hold more HQLA than they need to meet their LCR requirements the LCR Rule restricts the amount of such excess HQLA held at the Banks referred to as Trapped Liquidity that can be included in the Companys HQLA amount Because we typically manage the Banks LCRs to levels well above 100 the amount of Trapped Liquidity will also increase as the Banks total net cash outflows are reduced by the outflow adjustment percentage of 85 In October 2020 the Federal Banking Agencies finalized a rule to implement the NSFR in the United States the NSFR Rule The NSFR Rule requires the Company and each of the Banks to maintain an amount of available stable funding which is a weighted measure of a companys funding sources over a oneyear time horizon calculated by applying standardized weightings to equity and liabilities based on their expected stability that is no less than the amount of required stable funding which is calculated by applying standardized weightings to assets derivatives exposures and certain other items based on their liquidity characteristics As a Category III institution the Company and the Banks are subject to an NSFR requirement equal to 85 of the full NSFR requirement The NSFR Rule will become effective as of July 1 2021 and will apply to the Company and each of the Banks The NSFR Rule includes a semiannual disclosure requirement with the first public disclosure required after June 30 2023 Enhanced Prudential Standards and Other Related Requirements We are subject to certain enhanced prudential standards under the DoddFrank Act as amended by the Economic Growth Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act EGRRCPA and implemented by various regulations issued by the Federal Banking Agencies The Financial Stability Oversight Council FSOC may also issue recommendations to the Federal Reserve or other primary financial regulatory agencies to apply new or enhanced standards to certain financial activities or practices As part of the enhanced prudential standards the Company is required to implement resolution planning for orderly resolution in the event it faces material financial distress or failure The FDIC issued similar rules regarding resolution planning applicable to the Banks In addition the OCC has issued rules requiring banks with assets of 250 billion or more to develop recovery plans detailing the actions they would take to remain a going concern when they experience considerable financial or operational stress but have not deteriorated to the point that resolution is imminent The enhanced prudential standards also include supervisory and companyrun stress testing requirements also known as the DFAST stress testing requirements In particular the Federal Reserve is required to conduct annual stress tests on certain covered companies including us to ensure that the covered companies have sufficient capital to absorb losses and continue operations during adverse economic conditions Under the stress capital buffer framework the result of our supervisory stress test will be used to determine our stress capital buffer requirement As a covered company that is a Category III institution under the Tailoring Rules we are also required to conduct our own stress tests and publish the results of such tests on our website or other public forum The Company must disclose the results of its companyrun stress test on a biennial basis The 14 Capital One Financial Corporation COF Table of Contents OCC has adopted a similar stress test rule requiring banks with at least 250 billion in assets including CONA to conduct their own companyrun stress tests Under that OCC rule CONA must also disclose the results of its stress test on a biennial basis In addition the Company is required to meet liquidity risk management standards conduct internal liquidity stress tests and maintain a 30day buffer of highly liquid assets in each case consistent with the requirements of the enhanced prudential standards These requirements are in addition to the LCR and NSFR Rules discussed above in Basel III and United States Liquidity Rules The enhanced prudential standards also require that the Company comply with and hold capital commensurate with the requirements of any regulations adopted by the Federal Reserve relating to capital planning and stress tests Stress testing and capital planning regulations are discussed further below under Dividends Stock Repurchases and Transfers of Funds Finally the Company is also required to establish and maintain an enterprisewide risk management framework that includes a risk committee and a chief risk officer Although not a requirement of the DoddFrank Act the OCC established regulatory guidelines Heightened Standards Guidelines that apply heightened standards to the governance and risk management practices of large institutions subject to its supervision including the Banks The Heightened Standards Guidelines establish standards for the development and implementation by the Banks of a risk governance framework Dividends Stock Repurchases and Transfers of Funds Under the Federal Reserves capital planning rules commonly referred to as Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review or CCAR requirements a covered BHC such as the Company must submit a capital plan to the Federal Reserve on an annual basis that contains a description of all planned capital actions including dividends or stock repurchases over a ninequarter planning horizon beginning with the first quarter of the calendar year the capital plan is submitted CCAR cycle The DFAST stress testing requirements described above in Enhanced Prudential Standards and Other Related Requirements is a complementary exercise to CCAR It is a forwardlooking exercise conducted by the Federal Reserve and each covered company to help assess whether a company has sufficient capital to absorb losses and continue operations during adverse economic conditions Pursuant to the CCAR requirements the Company must file its capital plan and stress testing results with the Federal Reserve by April 5 of each year unless the Federal Reserve designates a later date using data as of the end of the prior calendar year The Federal Reserve will conduct its supervisory stress test in the second quarter and determine the Companys stress capital buffer by June 30 of that year The Company will have two business days from receipt of its stress capital buffer to make any necessary adjustments to its planned capital distributions The Federal Reserve will then finalize the stress capital buffer requirement for the Company based on its adjusted planned capital distributions and confirm the Companys planned capital distributions by August 31 of that year The Companys final stress capital buffer requirement will be effective from the fourth quarter of the year the capital plan is submitted through the third quarter of the following year The Company may make the planned capital distributions confirmed by the Federal Reserve In addition under the Stress Capital Buffer Rule the Company is no longer required to seek prior approval of the Federal Reserve to make capital distributions in excess of those included in its capital plan so long as the Company is otherwise in compliance with the capital rules automatic limitations on capital distributions In December 2018 the Federal Reserve announced that it would maintain its preCECL framework for calculating allowances on loans in the supervisory stress test for the 2020 and 2021 cycles until the impact of CECL is better known and understood The Federal Reserve stated further that although BHCs required to perform companyrun stress tests will be required to incorporate CECL into those stress tests starting in the 2020 cycle it will not issue supervisory findings on those BHCs allowance estimations in the CCAR exercise through 2021 Historically dividends from the Companys direct and indirect subsidiaries have represented a major source of the funds we have used to pay dividends on our capital stock make payments on our corporate debt securities and meet our other obligations There are various federal law limitations on the extent to which the Banks can finance or otherwise supply funds to the Company through dividends and loans These limitations include minimum regulatory capital requirements federal banking law requirements concerning the payment of dividends out of net profits or surplus provisions of Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation W governing transactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliates as well as general federal regulatory oversight to prevent unsafe or unsound practices In general federal and applicable state banking laws prohibit insured depository institutions such as the Banks from making dividend distributions without first 15 Capital One Financial Corporation COF Table of Contents obtaining regulatory approval if such distributions are not paid out of available earnings or would cause the institution to fail to meet applicable capital adequacy standards In June 2020 in light of the COVID19 pandemic the Federal Reserve required all CCAR participating BHCs including us to update and resubmit their capital plans in the fourth quarter of 2020 In addition the Federal Reserve required all participating BHCs including us to preserve capital by suspending share repurchases and capping common stock dividend payments for the third and fourth quarters of 2020 to the lower of i the amount paid in the second quarter of 2020 and ii an amount equal to the average net income earned across the four preceding calendar quarters Scheduled payments on additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital instruments such as preferred stock and subordinated debt were not similarly restricted We conducted a second round of stress tests and submitted our updated capital plan to the Federal Reserve on November 2 2020 On December 18 2020 the Federal Reserve released the results of its second round of supervisory stress tests The Federal Reserve did not recalculate our stress capital buffer requirement at that time but reserved its ability to do so until March 31 2021 Finally the Federal Reserve extended the capital distribution restrictions for all participating BHCs through at least the first quarter of 2021 with certain modifications In particular for the first quarter of 2021 participating BHCs may resume share repurchases but the aggregate amount of common stock dividend payments and share repurchases shall not exceed an amount equal to the average net income earned across the four preceding calendar quarters In addition common stock dividend payments for the first quarter of 2021 continue to be capped at the amount paid in the second quarter of 2020 Investment in the Company and the Banks Certain acquisitions of our capital stock may be subject to regulatory approval or notice under federal or state law Investors are responsible for ensuring that they do not directly or indirectly acquire shares of our capital stock in excess of the amount that can be acquired without regulatory approval including under the BHC Act and the Change in Bank Control Act CIBC Act Federal law and regulations prohibit any person or company from acquiring control of the Company or the Banks without in most cases prior written approval of the Federal Reserve or the OCC as applicable Control under the BHC Act exists if among other things a person or company acquires more than 25 of any class of our voting stock or otherwise has a controlling influence over us A rebuttable presumption of control arises under the CIBC Act for a publicly traded BHC such as ourselves if a person or company acquires more than 10 of any class of our voting stock Additionally COBNA and CONA are banks within the meaning of Chapter 13 of Title 61 of the Code of Virginia governing the acquisition of interests in Virginia financial institutions Financial Institution Holding Company Act The Financial Institution Holding Company Act prohibits any person or entity from acquiring or making any public offer to acquire control of a Virginia financial institution or its holding company without making application to and receiving prior approval from the Virginia Bureau of Financial Institutions Deposit Insurance Assessments Each of CONA and COBNA as an insured depository institution is a member of the DIF maintained by the FDIC Through the DIF the FDIC insures the deposits of insured depository institutions up to prescribed limits for each depositor The FDIC sets a Designated Reserve Ratio DRR for the DIF To maintain the DIF member institutions may be assessed an insurance premium and the FDIC may take action to increase insurance premiums if the DRR falls below its required level As of June 30 2020 the DIF reserve ratio fell to 130 percent The FDIC as required under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act established a plan in September 2020 to restore the DIF reserve ratio to meet or exceed 135 percent within eight years The FDICs restoration plan projects the reserve ratio to exceed 135 percent without increasing the deposit insurance assessment rate subject to ongoing monitoring over the next eight years Source of Strength and Liability for Commonly Controlled Institutions Under regulations issued by the Federal Reserve a BHC must serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks the socalled source of strength doctrine The DoddFrank Act codified this doctrine Under the crossguarantee provision of the Financial Institutions Reform Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 FIRREA insured depository institutions such as the Banks may be liable to the FDIC with respect to any loss incurred or reasonably anticipated to be incurred by the FDIC in connection with the default of or FDIC assistance to any commonly 16 Capital One Financial Corporation COF Table of Contents controlled insured depository institution The Banks are commonly controlled within the meaning of the FIRREA crossguarantee provision FDIC Orderly Liquidation Authority The DoddFrank Act provides the FDIC with liquidation authority that may be used to liquidate nonbank financial companies and BHCs if the Treasury Secretary in consultation with the President and based on the recommendation of the Federal Reserve and other appropriate Federal Banking Agencies determines that doing so is necessary among other criteria to mitigate serious adverse effects on US financial stability Upon such a determination the FDIC would be appointed receiver and must liquidate the company in a way that mitigates significant risks to financial stability and minimizes moral hazard The costs of a liquidation of the company would be borne by shareholders and unsecured creditors and then if necessary by riskbased assessments on large financial companies The FDIC has issued rules implementing certain provisions of its liquidation authority and may issue additional rules in the future COVID19 Activities In response to disruptions in economic conditions caused by the COVID19 pandemic federal and state governments and agencies and governmentsponsored enterprises have taken a variety of actions to support people and entities affected by the pandemic including the passage of the Coronavirus Aid Relief and Economic Security Act the CARES Act in March 2020 The CARES Act among other provisions authorized a number of lending programs to support the flow of credit to consumers and businesses For example the CARES Act established several programs with the Small Business Administration including the PPP to provide loans to small businesses The Federal Reserve had also taken extraordinary efforts in response to the pandemic including among other actions the establishment of a Main Street Lending Program that is intended to support lending to eligible small and midsize businesses The Federal Banking Agencies had also encouraged banking organizations to take certain additional actions to support the financial services needs of their customers in a prudent and safe and sound manner including through loan modifications Further banking organizations had been provided with certain accounting supervisory and regulatory relief during this period including relief that is intended to allow banking organizations to enter into loan modifications without certain accounting and regulatory capital consequences For example the CARES Act gave banking organizations an option to temporarily suspend the determination of certain qualified loans modified as a result of the COVID19 pandemic as being troubled debt restructurings TDRs See MDACredit Risk ProfileCOVID19 Customer Assistance Programs and Loan Modifications for additional information The CARES Act also amended the Fair Credit Reporting Act to impose new temporary reporting requirements on furnishers of information to consumer reporting agencies related to accounts of consumers in payment accommodation programs in light of the COVID19 pandemic The Consolidated Appropriations Act 2021 which was enacted in December 2020 extends certain relief provided by the CARES Act while also modifying or clarifying certain other provisions Among other amendments to the CARES Act the Consolidated Appropriations Act 2021 extends the relief related to TDRs until January 1 2022 and the PPP until March 31 2021 In addition the Consolidated Appropriations Act 2021 rescinds certain funds that were appropriated to the US Treasury to provide loans loan guarantees and make other investments in programs or facilities established by the Federal Reserve and prohibits the Federal Reserve from making any new investments loans or loan guarantees or extensions of credit through those rescinded funds after December 31 2020 Congress could determine to reauthorize these programs in future legislative packages Federal Reserve programs and facilities that were not established using CARES Act funding are not affected by the Consolidated Appropriations Act 2021 For a discussion of the risks associated with the impact of the COVID19 pandemic and related public health measures see Part IItem

The COVID19 pandemic has adversely impacted our business and financial results and the extent to which the pandemic and measures taken in response to the pandemic could materially and adversely impact our business financial condition liquidity capital and results of operations will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict Global health concerns relating to the COVID19 pandemic and related government actions taken to reduce the spread of the virus have impacted the macroeconomic environment significantly increased economic uncertainty and reduced economic activity The pandemic has also caused governmental authorities to implement numerous measures to try to contain the virus including travel bans and restrictions quarantines shelterinplace orders and business limitations and shutdowns These measures have negatively impacted and may further negatively impact consumer and business payment and spending patterns The COVID19 pandemic has adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact our business operations financial condition capital and results of operations The extent of these impacts depends on future developments which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict including but not limited to the duration and magnitude of the pandemic the actions taken to contain the virus or treat its impact the effectiveness of economic stimulus measures in the United States and how quickly and 24 Capital One Financial Corporation COF Table of Contents to what extent economic and operating conditions and consumer and business spending can return to their prepandemic levels As of December 31 2020 several vaccines have been authorized for limited distribution The plan for larger communitybased distribution is being developed and may begin during the second quarter of 2021 However the timing and extent of any such widespread distribution of vaccines remains uncertain As a result of this uncertainty our purchase volume loan growth and the overall demand for our products and services may be significantly impacted which could adversely affect our revenue and other results of operations In addition we could experience higher credit losses in our loan portfolios and increases in our allowance for credit losses beyond current levels For example as a result of the significant uncertainty due to the COVID19 pandemic we realized a substantial build in our allowance for credit losses for the first two quarters of 2020 We could also experience impairments of other financial assets and other negative impacts on our financial position including possible constraints on liquidity and capital as well as higher costs of capital Even after the COVID19 pandemic has subsided we may continue to experience adverse impacts to our business and results of operations which could be material as a result of the macroeconomic impact and any recession that has occurred or may occur in the future The spread of COVID19 has caused us to modify our business practices and operations including providing a range of forbearance options to our customers in certain circumstances which could impact our credit metrics financial condition capital and results of operations We may need to further modify our practices and operations as this event unfolds We have also implemented workfromhome policies for a vast majority of our employees and social distancing plans for our employees who are working from Capital One facilities Nearly all of our Cafs and bank branches across our network are open with increased safety precautions We will continue to monitor local conditions to ensure the safety of our associates and customers while providing critical banking services These measures could impair our ability to perform critical functions and may adversely impact our results of operations In addition these measures and other changes in consumer behavior as a result of the COVID19 pandemic may require changes to retail distribution strategies and adversely impact our investments in our bank premises and equipment and other retail distribution assets leading to increased costs and exposure to additional risks We may take further actions as required by government authorities or that we otherwise determine are in the best interests of our customers employees and business partners Federal state local and foreign governmental authorities have enacted and may enact in the future legislation regulations and protocols in response to the COVID19 pandemic including governmental programs intended to provide economic relief to businesses and individuals We have participated in certain of these programs including participating as an eligible lender in the Small Business Administrations Paycheck Protection Program Our participation in and execution of any such programs may cause operational compliance reputational and credit risks which could result in litigation governmental action or other forms of loss The extent of these impacts which may be substantial will depend on the degree of our participation in these programs There remains significant uncertainty regarding the measures that authorities will enact in the future and the ultimate impact of the legislation regulations and protocols that have been and will be enacted Moreover we expect that the effects of the COVID19 pandemic will heighten many of the other known risks described herein See Part IItem 1BusinessOverviewCoronavirus Disease 2019 COVID19 Pandemic Changes and instability in the macroeconomic environment consumer confidence and customer behavior may adversely affect our business We offer a broad array of financial products and services to consumers small businesses and commercial clients A prolonged period of economic volatility slow growth or a significant deterioration in economic conditions in the US Canada or the UK could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations as customers default on their loans maintain lower deposit levels or in the case of credit card accounts carry lower balances and reduce credit card purchase activity Some of the risks we face in connection with adverse changes and instability in the macroeconomic environment including changes in consumer confidence levels and behavior include the following  Changes in payment patterns increases in delinquencies and default rates decreased consumer spending lower demand for credit and shifts in consumer payment behavior towards avoiding late fees finance charges and other fees  Increases in our chargeoff rate caused by bankruptcies and reduced ability to recover debt that we have previously chargedoff  Decreased reliability of the process and models we use to estimate our allowance for loan and lease losses particularly if unexpected variations in key inputs and assumptions cause actual losses to diverge from the projections of our models 25 Capital One Financial Corporation COF Table of Contents and our estimates become increasingly subject to managements judgment See  We face risks resulting from the extensive use of models and data  The UK and the European Union agreed to a free trade deal at the end of 2020 relating to the UKs exit from the European Union Brexit While this deal provides greater nearterm stability the ongoing impact of Brexit and its full effects on the UK economy and our business related thereto remain uncertain We continue to consider and monitor the potential impacts and other factors including the COVID19 pandemic that could also impact UK economic performance Financial market instability and volatility could adversely affect our business Our ability to borrow from other financial institutions or to engage in funding transactions on favorable terms or at all could be adversely affected by disruptions in the capital markets or other events including actions by rating agencies and deteriorating investor expectations which could limit our access to funding In addition fluctuations in interest rates credit spreads and other market factors could negatively impact our results of operations Both shorterterm and longerterm interest rates remain below longterm historical averages and the yield curve has been relatively flat compared to past periods A flat yield curve combined with low interest rates generally leads to lower revenue and reduced margins because it tends to limit our ability to increase the spread between asset yields and funding costs Sustained periods of time with a flat yield curve coupled with low interest rates or an inversion of the yield curve could have a material adverse effect on our net interest margin and earnings In response to the economic consequences of the COVID19 pandemic the Federal Reserve lowered its target for the federal funds rate to a range of 0 to 025 Such low rates increase the risk in the US of a negative interest rate environment in which interest rates drop below zero either broadly or for some types of instruments For example yields on onemonth and threemonth Treasuries briefly dropped below zero in March 2020 Such an occurrence would likely further reduce the interest we earn on loans and other interestearning assets while also likely requiring us to pay to maintain our deposits with the Federal Reserve Our systems may not be able to handle adequately a negative interest rate environment and not all variable rate instruments are designed for such a circumstance We cannot predict the nature or timing of future changes in monetary policies in response to the COVID19 pandemic or the precise effects that they may have on our activities and financial results Credit Risk We may experience increased delinquencies credit losses inaccurate estimates and inadequate reserves Like other lenders we face the risk that our customers will not repay their loans A customers ability and willingness to repay us can be adversely affected by increases in their payment obligations to other lenders whether as a result of higher debt levels or rising interest rates by restricted availability of credit generally or by the revenue and income of the borrower We may fail to quickly identify and reduce our exposure to customers that are likely to default on their payment obligations whether by closing credit lines or restricting authorizations Our ability to manage credit risk also is affected by legal or regulatory changes such as restrictions on collections bankruptcy laws minimum payment regulations and reage guidance competitors actions and consumer behavior and depends on the effectiveness of our collections staff techniques and models Rising losses or leading indicators of rising losses such as higher delinquencies higher rates of nonperforming loans higher bankruptcy rates lower collateral values elevated unemployment rates or changing market terms may require us to increase our allowance for credit losses which may degrade our profitability if we are unable to raise revenue or reduce costs to compensate for higher losses In particular we face the following risks in this area  Missed Payments Our customers may miss payments Loan chargeoffs including from bankruptcies are generally preceded by missed payments or other indications of worsening financial condition for our customers Historically customers are more likely to miss payments during an economic downturn or prolonged periods of slow economic growth In addition we face the risk that consumer and commercial customer behavior may change for example an increase in the unwillingness or inability of customers to repay debt which may be heightened by increasing interest rates or levels of consumer debt causing a longterm rise in delinquencies and chargeoffs  Incorrect Estimates of Expected Losses The credit quality of our portfolio can have a significant impact on our earnings We allow for and reserve against credit risks based on our assessment of expected credit losses in our loan portfolios This process which is critical to our financial condition and results of operations requires complex judgments including forecasts of economic conditions We may underestimate our expected losses and fail to hold an allowance for credit losses sufficient to account for these losses Incorrect assumptions could lead to material underestimations of expected credit losses and an inadequate allowance for credit losses 26 Capital One Financial Corporation COF Table of Contents  Inaccurate Underwriting Our ability to accurately assess the creditworthiness of our customers may diminish which could result in an increase in our credit losses and a deterioration of our returns See  Our risk management strategies may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposures in all market environments or against all types of risk   Business Mix We engage in a diverse mix of businesses with a broad range of potential credit exposure Because we originate a relatively greater proportion of consumer loans in our loan portfolio compared to other large bank peers and originate both prime and subprime credit card accounts and auto loans we may experience higher delinquencies and a greater number of accounts charging off compared to other large bank peers which could result in increased credit losses operating costs and regulatory scrutiny Additionally a change in this business mix over time to include proportionally more consumer loans or subprime credit card accounts or auto loans could adversely affect the credit quality of our portfolio  Increasing Chargeoff RecognitionAllowance for Credit Losses We account for the allowance for credit losses according to accounting and regulatory guidelines and rules including Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB standards and the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council FFIEC Account Management Guidance Effective as of January 1 2020 we adopted the CECL standard which is based on expected lifetime losses rather than incurred losses Adoption of the CECL standard has resulted and may continue to result in an increase to our reserves for credit losses on financial instruments with a resulting adverse impact on our financial condition The continued impact of CECL on our future results will depend on the characteristics of our financial instruments economic conditions and our economic and loss forecasts The application of the CECL standard requires us to increase reserves faster and to a higher level in an economic downturn resulting in greater impact to our results and our capital ratios than we would have experienced in similar circumstances prior to the adoption of CECL In addition because credit cards represent a significant portion of our product mix we could be disproportionately affected by use of the CECL standard as compared to our large bank peers with a different product mix See MDAAccounting Changes and Developments for additional information  Insufficient Asset Values The collateral we have on secured loans could be insufficient to compensate us for credit losses When customers default on their secured loans we attempt to recover collateral where permissible and appropriate However the value of the collateral may not be sufficient to compensate us for the amount of the unpaid loan and we may be unsuccessful in recovering the remaining balance from our customers Decreases in real estate and other asset values adversely affect the collateral value for our commercial lending activities while the auto business is similarly exposed to collateral risks arising from the auction markets that determine used car prices Borrowers may be less likely to continue making payments on loans if the value of the property used as collateral for the loan is less than what the borrower owes even if the borrower is still financially able to make the payments In that circumstance the recovery of such property could be insufficient to compensate us for the value of these loans upon a default In our auto business business and economic conditions that negatively affect household incomes housing prices and consumer behavior as well as technological advances that make older cars obsolete faster could decrease i the demand for new and used vehicles and ii the value of the collateral underlying our portfolio of auto loans which could cause the number of consumers who become delinquent or default on their loans to increase  Geographic and Industry Concentration Although our consumer lending is geographically diversified approximately 27 of our commercial loan portfolio is concentrated in the tristate area of New York New Jersey and Connecticut The regional economic conditions in the tristate area affect the demand for our commercial products and services as well as the ability of our customers to repay their commercial loans and the value of the collateral securing these loans An economic downturn or prolonged period of slow economic growth in or a catastrophic event that disproportionately affects the tristate area could have a material adverse effect on the performance of our commercial loan portfolio and our results of operations In addition our Commercial Banking strategy includes an industryspecific focus If any of the industries that we focus on experience changes we may experience increased credit losses and our results of operations could be adversely impacted For example as of December 31 2020 healthcare and healthcarerelated real estate loans represented approximately 19 of our total commercial loan portfolio If healthcarerelated industries or any of the other industries that we focus on experience adverse changes we may experience increased credit losses and our results of operations could be adversely impacted 27 Capital One Financial Corporation COF Table of Contents Capital and Liquidity Risk We may not be able to maintain adequate capital or liquidity levels which could have a negative impact on our financial results and our ability to return capital to our stockholders Financial institutions are subject to extensive and complex capital and liquidity requirements These requirements affect our ability to lend grow deposit balances make acquisitions and make most capital distributions Failure to maintain adequate capital or liquidity levels whether due to adverse developments in our business or the economy or to changes in the applicable requirements could subject us to a variety of remedies available to our regulators These include limitations on the ability to pay dividends repurchase shares and the issuance of a capital directive to increase capital Such limitations could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations We consider various factors in the management of capital including the impact of stress on our capital levels as determined by both our internal modeling and the Federal Reserves modeling of our capital position in supervisory stress tests and CCAR There can be significant differences between our modeling and the Federal Reserves estimates for a given scenario and between the capital needs suggested by our internal bank holding company scenarios relative to the supervisory scenarios Therefore although our estimated capital levels under stress disclosed as part of the CCAR or DFAST processes may suggest that we have substantial capacity to return capital to stockholders and remain well capitalized under stress the Federal Reserves modeling our internal modeling of another scenario or other factors related to our capital management process may result in a materially lower capacity to return capital to stockholders than that indicated by the projections released in the CCAR or DFAST processes This in turn could lead to restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and engage in share repurchase transactions See Part IItem 1 BusinessSupervision and Regulation for additional information In addition the current capital and liquidity requirements are subject to change The Federal Banking Agencies finalized the Tailoring Rule in the fourth quarter of 2019 Under the Tailoring Rule we are a Category III institution and are no longer subject to the Basel III Advanced Approaches and associated capital requirements but we continue to be subject to the countercyclical capital buffer and supplementary leverage ratio In March 2020 the Federal Reserve issued a final rule to implement the stress capital buffer requirement This final rule became effective in May 2020 Pursuant to the Stress Capital Buffer Rule the Federal Reserve will use the results of its supervisory stress test to determine the size of a large banking institutions stress capital buffer requirement which replaces the previous 25 capital conservation buffer under the Basel III Standardized Approach Our stress capital buffer requirement is 56 for the period from October 1 2020 through September 30 2021 at which point a revised stress capital buffer requirement will be applicable to us based on our 2021 stress testing results In addition on June 25 2020 the Federal Reserve introduced measures to ensure that large BHCs maintained a high level of capital resilience Specifically the Federal Reserve required certain large BHCs including us to suspend share repurchases and cap common dividends during the third and fourth quarters of 2020 Consistent with the Federal Reserves capital distribution restrictions we reduced our quarterly dividend on our common stock from 040 per share to 010 per share for the third quarter of 2020 which we maintained into the fourth quarter of 2020 The Federal Banking Agencies also finalized rules to implement the NSFR in October 2020 The NSFR is designed to ensure that banking organizations maintain a stable longterm funding profile in relation to their asset composition and offbalance sheet activities and its requirements will become effective as of July 1 2021 On December 18 2020 the Federal Reserve extended the capital distribution restrictions for all participating BHCs to the first quarter of 2021 with certain modifications In particular for the first quarter of 2021 participating BHCs may resume share repurchases however the aggregate amount of dividend payments and share repurchases will be limited to an amount based on net income earned in the preceding four calendar quarters See Part IItem 1 BusinessSupervision and Regulation for additional information Further changes to applicable capital and liquidity requirements could result in unexpected or new limitations on our ability to pay dividends and engage in share repurchases Operational Risk We face risks related to our operational technological and organizational infrastructure Our ability to retain and attract customers depends on our ability to develop operate and adapt our technology and organizational infrastructure in a rapidly changing environment In addition we must accurately process record and monitor an increasingly large number of complex transactions Digital technology data and software development are deeply embedded into our business model and how we work Similar to other large corporations we are exposed to operational risk that can manifest itself in many ways such as errors in execution inadequate processes inaccurate models faulty or disabled technological infrastructure and fraud by employees or 28 Capital One Financial Corporation COF Table of Contents persons outside of our company In addition we are heavily dependent on the security capability and continuous availability of the technology systems that we use to manage our internal financial and other systems monitor risk and compliance with regulatory requirements provide services to our customers develop and offer new products and communicate with stakeholders We also face risk of adverse customer impacts and business disruption arising from the execution of strategic initiatives we may pursue across our operations If we do not maintain the necessary operational technological and organizational infrastructure to operate our business including to maintain the security of that infrastructure our business and reputation could be materially adversely affected We also are subject to disruptions to our operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond our control which may include computer viruses electrical or telecommunications outages design flaws in foundational components or platforms availability and quality of vulnerability patches from key vendors cyberattacks including Distributed Denial of Service DDOS and other attacks on our infrastructure as discussed below natural disasters other damage to property or physical assets or events arising from local or larger scale politics including terrorist acts Any failure to maintain our infrastructure or disruption of our operating systems and applications could diminish our ability to operate our businesses service customer accounts and protect customers information or result in potential liability to customers reputational damage regulatory intervention and customers loss of confidence in our businesses any of which could result in a material adverse effect We also rely on the business infrastructure and systems of third parties with which we do business and to whom we outsource the operation maintenance and development of our information technology and communications systems We have migrated substantially all and intend to migrate all of our core information technology systems and customerfacing applications to thirdparty cloud infrastructure platforms principally AWS If we do not complete the transition or fail to administer these new environments in a wellmanaged secure and effective manner or if AWS platforms become unavailable or do not meet their service level agreements for any reason we may experience unplanned service disruption or unforeseen costs which could result in material harm to our business and results of operations We must successfully develop and maintain information financial reporting disclosure dataprotection and other controls adapted to our reliance on outside platforms and providers In addition AWS or other service providers could experience system breakdowns or failures outages downtime cyberattacks adverse changes to financial condition bankruptcy or other adverse conditions which could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation Thus the substantial amount of our infrastructure that we outsource to AWS or to other third parties may increase our risk exposure Any disruptions failures or inaccuracies of our operational and technology systems and models including those associated with improvements or modifications to such systems and models could cause us to be unable to market and manage our products and services manage our risk meet our regulatory obligations or report our financial results in a timely and accurate manner all of which could have a negative impact on our results of operations In addition our ongoing investments in infrastructure which are necessary to maintain a competitive business integrate acquisitions and establish scalable operations may increase our expenses As our business develops changes or expands additional expenses can arise as a result of a reevaluation of business strategies management of outsourced services asset purchases or other acquisitions structural reorganization compliance with new laws or regulations or the integration of newly acquired businesses or the prevention or occurrence of data security incidents If we are unable to successfully manage our expenses our financial results will be negatively affected Changes to our business including as a result of our strategic objectives also requires robust governance to ensure that our objectives are executed as intended without adversely impacting our customers associates operations or financial performance Ineffective change management oversight and governance over the execution of our strategic objectives could expose us to operational strategic and reputational risk and could negatively impact customers or our financial performance Theft loss or misuse of information as a result of a cyberattack may result in increased costs reductions in revenue reputational damage and business disruptions Our products and services involve the gathering authenticating managing processing and the storing and transmission of sensitive and confidential information regarding our customers and their accounts our employees and third parties with which we do business Our ability to provide such products and services many of which are webbased depends upon the management and safeguarding of information software methodologies and business secrets To provide these products and services to as well as communicate with our customers we rely on information systems and infrastructure including software and data engineering and information security personnel digital technologies computer and email systems software networks and other webbased technologies We also have arrangements in place with third parties through which we share and receive information about their customers who are or may become our customers 29 Capital One Financial Corporation COF Table of Contents Technologies systems networks and devices of Capital One or our employees service providers or other third parties with whom we interact may continue to be the subject of attempted unauthorized access mishandling or misuse of information denialofservice attacks computer viruses website defacement hacking malware ransomware phishing or other forms of social engineering and other forms of cyberattacks designed to obtain confidential information destroy data disrupt or degrade service sabotage systems or cause other damage and other events These threats such as the Cybersecurity Incident may derive from error fraud or malice on the part of our employees insiders or third parties or may result from accidental technological failure Any of these parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees customers or other thirdparty users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or that of our customers or third parties with whom we interact or to unlawfully obtain monetary benefit through misdirected or otherwise improper payment Further cyber and information security risks for large financial institutions like us continue to increase due to the proliferation of new technologies the use of the internet to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime perpetrators of fraud hackers terrorists activists formal and informal instrumentalities of foreign governments and other external parties In addition our customers access our products and services using computers smartphones tablets and other mobile devices that are beyond our security control systems The methods and techniques employed by perpetrators of fraud and others to attack disable degrade or sabotage platforms systems and applications change frequently are increasingly sophisticated and often are not fully recognized or understood until after they have occurred and some techniques could occur and persist for an extended period of time before being detected For example although we immediately fixed the configuration vulnerability that was exploited in the Cybersecurity Incident once we discovered the unauthorized access a period of time elapsed between the occurrence of the unauthorized access and the time when we discovered it In other circumstances we and our thirdparty service providers and partners may be unable to anticipate or identify certain attack methods in order to implement effective preventative measures or mitigate or remediate the damages caused in a timely manner We may also be unable to hire and develop talent capable of detecting mitigating or remediating these risks Although we seek to maintain a robust suite of authentication and layered information security controls including our cyber threat analytics data encryption and tokenization technologies antimalware defenses and vulnerability management program any one or combination of these controls could fail to detect mitigate or remediate these risks in a timely manner We will likely face an increasing number of attempted cyberattacks as we expand our mobile and other internetbased products and services as well as our usage of mobile and cloud technologies and as we provide more of these services to a greater number of retail clients A disruption or breach including as a result of a cyberattack such as the Cybersecurity Incident or media reports of perceived security vulnerabilities at Capital One or at our thirdparty service providers could result in significant legal and financial exposure regulatory intervention litigation and remediation costs card reissuance supervisory liability damage to our reputation or loss of confidence in the security of our systems products and services that could adversely affect our business We and other US financial services providers continue to be targeted with evolving and adaptive cybersecurity threats from sophisticated third parties We are continuing to assess the impact of the Cybersecurity Incident and there can be no assurance that additional unauthorized access or cyber incidents will not occur or that we will not suffer material losses in the future Unauthorized access or cybersecurity incidents could occur more frequently and on a more significant scale If future attacks like these are successful or if customers are unable to access their accounts online for other reasons it could adversely impact our ability to service customer accounts or loans complete financial transactions for our customers or otherwise operate any of our businesses or services In addition a breach or attack affecting one of our thirdparty service providers or partners could harm our business even if we do not control the service that is attacked In addition the increasing prevalence and the evolution of cyberattacks and other efforts to breach or disrupt our systems or those of our partners retailers or other market participants has led and will likely continue to lead to increased costs to us with respect to preventing mitigating and remediating these risks as well as any related attempted fraud In order to address ongoing and future risks including from the Cybersecurity Incident we must expend significant resources to support protective security measures investigate and remediate any vulnerabilities of our information systems and infrastructure and invest in new technology designed to mitigate security risks The Cybersecurity Incident or successful cyberattacks at other large financial institutions or other market participants whether or not we are impacted could lead to a general loss of customer confidence in financial institutions that could negatively affect us including harming the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures or the financial system in general which could result in reduced use of our financial products We have insurance against some cyberrisks and attacks including insurance that is expected to cover certain costs associated with the Cybersecurity Incident nonetheless our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to offset the impact of a material loss event and such insurance may increase in cost or cease to be available on commercial terms in the future 30 Capital One Financial Corporation COF Table of Contents Potential data protection and privacy incidents and our required compliance with regulations related to these areas may increase our costs reduce our revenue and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities A breach failure or other disruption of our information systems or infrastructure or data management processes or those of our customers partners service providers or other market participants could lead depending on the nature of the incident to the unauthorized or unintended access to and release gathering monitoring misuse loss or destruction of personal or confidential data about our customers employees or other third parties in our possession Any party that obtains this personal or confidential data through a breach or disruption may use this information for ransom to be paid by us or a thirdparty as part of a fraudulent activity that is part of a broader criminal activity or for other illicit purposes Further such disruption or breach could also result in unauthorized access to our proprietary information intellectual property software methodologies and business secrets and in unauthorized transactions in Capital One accounts or unauthorized access to personal or confidential information maintained by those entities There has been a significant proliferation of consumer information available on the internet resulting from breaches of thirdparty entities including personal information login credentials and authentication data While we were not directly involved in these thirdparty breach events the stolen information can create a vulnerability for our customers if their Capital One login credentials are the same as or similar to the credentials that have been compromised on other sites This vulnerability could include the risk of unauthorized account access data loss and fraud The use of artificial intelligence bots or other automation software can increase the velocity and efficacy of these types of attacks We are continuing to assess the impact of the Cybersecurity Incident The Cybersecurity Incident other data security incidents we may experience in the future or media reports of perceived security vulnerabilities at Capital One or at thirdparty service providers could result in significant legal and financial exposure regulatory intervention remediation costs card reissuance supervisory liability damage to our reputation or loss of confidence in the security of our systems products and services that could adversely affect our business We are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations in the United States and abroad regarding privacy data protection and data security including those related to the collection storage handling use disclosure transfer and security of personal data Significant uncertainty exists as privacy and data protection laws may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements For example in Canada we are subject to the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act PIPEDA In addition the General Data Protection Regulation GDPR applies EU data protection law to all companies processing data of EU residents regardless of the companys location More recently on January 1 2020 the CCPA went into effect for companies doing business in California These laws impose strict requirements regarding the collection storage handling use disclosure transfer and security of personal data which may have adverse consequences including severe monetary penalties Our efforts to comply with PIPEDA GDPR CCPA and other privacy and data protection laws entail substantial expenses may divert resources from other initiatives and projects and could limit the services we are able to offer Furthermore enforcement actions and investigations by regulatory authorities related to data security incidents and privacy violations continue to increase The enactment of more restrictive laws rules regulations or future enforcement actions or investigations could impact us through increased costs or restrictions on our business and noncompliance could result in monetary or other penalties and significant legal liability We face risks resulting from the extensive use of models and data We rely on quantitative models and our ability to manage data and aggregate data in an accurate and timely manner assess and manage our various risk exposures estimate certain financial values and manage compliance with required regulatory capital requirements Models may be used in such processes as determining the pricing of various products grading loans and extending credit measuring interest rate and other market risks predicting deposit levels or loan losses assessing capital adequacy and calculating economic and regulatory capital levels estimating the value of financial instruments and balance sheet items and other operational functions Our risk reporting and management including business decisions based on information incorporating models depend on the effectiveness of our models and our policies programs processes and practices governing how data is acquired validated stored protected processed and analyzed Any issues with the quality or effectiveness of our data aggregation and validation procedures as well as the quality and integrity of data inputs formulas or algorithms could result in inaccurate forecasts ineffective risk management practices or inaccurate risk reporting In addition models based on historical data sets might not be accurate predictors of future outcomes and their ability to appropriately predict future outcomes may degrade over time While we continuously update our policies programs processes and practices many of our data management aggregation and implementation processes are manual and subject to human error or system failure Failure to manage data effectively and to aggregate data in an accurate and timely manner may limit our ability to 31 Capital One Financial Corporation COF Table of Contents manage current and emerging risk to produce accurate financial regulatory and operational reporting as well as to manage changing business needs If our risk management framework is ineffective we could suffer unexpected losses which could materially adversely affect our results of operation or financial condition Also any information we provide to the public or to our regulators based on poorly designed or implemented models could be inaccurate or misleading Some of the decisions that our regulators make including those related to capital distribution to our stockholders could be affected adversely due to the perception that the quality of the models used to generate the relevant information is insufficient Legal and Regulatory Risk Compliance with new and existing laws regulations and regulatory expectations is costly and complex We are subject to extensive regulatory oversight by the federal banking regulators to ensure that we build systems and processes that are commensurate with the nature of our business and that meet the risk management and prudential standards issued by our regulators A wide array of banking and consumer lending laws apply to almost every aspect of our business Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in financial structural and operational penalties including significant fines and criminal sanctions andor damage to our reputation with regulators our customers or the public Hiring training and retaining qualified compliance and legal personnel and establishing and maintaining compliancerelated systems infrastructure and processes is difficult and these efforts could limit our ability to invest in other business opportunities Furthermore applicable rules and regulations may affect us in an unforeseen manner or may have a disproportionate impact on us as compared to our competitors Over the last several years state and federal regulators have focused on compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act and antimoney laundering AML laws data integrity and security use of service providers fair lending and other consumer protection issues For example in July 2015 Capital One entered into a consent order with the OCC to address concerns about our AML program and in October 2018 Capital One paid a civil monetary penalty assessed by the OCC relating to our AML program The OCC lifted the AML consent order in November 2019 In addition in August 2020 we entered into consent orders with the Federal Reserve and the OCC resulting from regulatory reviews of the Cybersecurity Incident and relating to ongoing enhancements of our cybersecurity and operational risk management processes and we paid a civil monetary penalty as part of the OCC agreement In January 2021 we also paid a civil monetary penalty assessed by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network FinCEN against CONA in connection with our AML program Failure to maintain compliance with laws and regulations could result in significant additional governmental fines or penalties We have a large number of customer accounts in our credit card and auto lending businesses and we have made the strategic choice to originate and service subprime credit card and auto loans which typically have higher delinquencies and chargeoffs than prime customers As a result we have significant involvement with credit bureau reporting and the collection and recovery of delinquent and chargedoff debt primarily through customer communications the filing of litigation against customers in default the periodic sale of chargedoff debt and vehicle repossession These activities are subject to enhanced legal and regulatory scrutiny from regulators courts and legislators Any future changes to our business practices in these areas including our debt collection practices whether mandated by regulators courts legislators or otherwise or any legal liabilities resulting from our business practices including our debt collection practices could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition The legislative and regulatory environment is beyond our control may change rapidly and unpredictably and may negatively influence our revenue costs earnings growth liquidity and capital levels In addition some rules and regulations may be subject to litigation or other challenges that delay or modify their implementation and impact on us Adoption of new technologies such as distributed ledger technologies artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies can present unforeseen challenges in applying and relying on existing compliance systems Certain laws and regulations and any interpretations and applications with respect thereto are generally intended to protect consumers borrowers depositors the DIF the US banking and financial system and financial markets as a whole but not stockholders Our success depends on our ability to maintain compliance with both existing and new laws and regulations For a description of the material laws and regulations to which we are subject see Part IItem 1 BusinessSupervision and Regulation Our businesses are subject to the risk of increased litigation government investigations and regulatory enforcement Our businesses are subject to increased litigation government investigations and other regulatory enforcement risks as a result of a number of factors and from various sources including the highly regulated nature of the financial services industry the focus of state and federal prosecutors on banks and the financial services industry and the structure of the credit card industry 32 Capital One Financial Corporation COF Table of Contents Given the inherent uncertainties involved in litigation government investigations and regulatory enforcement decisions and the very large or indeterminate damages sought in some matters asserted against us there can be significant uncertainty as to the ultimate liability we may incur from these kinds of matters The finding or even the assertion of substantial legal liability against us could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition and could cause significant reputational harm to us which could seriously harm our business The Cybersecurity Incident has resulted in litigation government investigations and other regulatory enforcement inquiries In addition financial institutions such as ourselves face significant regulatory scrutiny which can lead to public enforcement actions or nonpublic supervisory actions We and our subsidiaries are subject to comprehensive regulation and periodic examination by among other regulatory bodies the Federal Reserve the SEC OCC FDIC and CFPB We have been subject to enforcement actions by many of these and other regulators and may continue to be involved in such actions including governmental inquiries investigations and enforcement proceedings including by the OCC Department of Justice FinCEN and state Attorneys General We expect that regulators and governmental enforcement bodies will continue taking formal enforcement actions against financial institutions in addition to addressing supervisory concerns through nonpublic supervisory actions or findings which could involve restrictions on our activities or our ability to make acquisitions or otherwise expand our business among other limitations that could adversely affect our business In addition a violation of law or regulation by another financial institution is likely to give rise to an investigation by regulators and other governmental agencies of the same or similar practices by us Furthermore a single event may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and proceedings These and other initiatives from governmental authorities and officials may subject us to further judgments settlements fines or penalties or cause us to restructure our operations and activities or to cease offering certain products or services all of which could harm our reputation or lead to higher operational costs Litigation government investigations and other regulatory actions could involve restrictions on our activities generally subject us to significant fines increased expenses restrictions on our activities and damage to our reputation and our brand and could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations For additional information regarding legal and regulatory proceedings that we are subject to see Note 18Commitments Contingencies Guarantees and Others Other Business Risks We face intense competition in all of our markets We operate in a highly competitive environment whether in making loans attracting deposits or in the global payments industry and we expect competitive conditions to continue to intensify with respect to most of our products We compete on the basis of the rates we pay on deposits and the rates and other terms we charge on the loans we originate or purchase as well as the quality and range of our customer service products innovation and experience This increasingly competitive environment is primarily a result of changes in technology product delivery systems and regulation as well as the emergence of new or significantly larger financial services providers all of which may affect our customers expectations and demands In addition to offering competitive products and services we invest in and conduct marketing campaigns to attract and inform customers Some of our competitors including new and emerging competitors in the digital and mobile payments space and other financial technology providers are not subject to the same regulatory requirements or legislative scrutiny to which we are subject which also could place us at a competitive disadvantage in particular in the development of new technology platforms or the ability to rapidly innovate We compete with many forms of payments offered by both bank and nonbank providers including a variety of new and evolving alternative payment mechanisms systems and products such as aggregators and webbased and wireless payment platforms or technologies digital or crypto currencies prepaid systems and payment services targeting users of social networks communications platforms and online gaming If we are unable to continue to keep pace with innovation do not effectively market our products and services or are prohibited from or unwilling to enter emerging areas of competition our business and results of operations could be adversely affected Some of our competitors are substantially larger than we are which may give those competitors advantages including a more diversified product and customer base the ability to reach more customers and potential customers operational efficiencies broadbased local distribution capabilities lowercost funding and larger existing branch networks Many of our competitors are also focusing on crossselling their products and developing new products or technologies which could affect our ability to maintain or grow existing customer relationships or require us to offer lower interest rates or fees on our lending products or higher interest rates on deposits Competition for loans could result in origination of fewer loans earning less on our loans or an increase in loans that perform below expectations 33 Capital One Financial Corporation COF Table of Contents As of December 31 2020 we operate as one of the largest online direct banks in the United States by deposits While direct banking provides a significant opportunity to attract new customers that value greater and more flexible access to banking services at reduced costs we face strong and increasing competition in the direct banking market Aggressive pricing throughout the industry may adversely affect the retention of existing balances and the costefficient acquisition of new deposit funds and may affect our growth and profitability Customers could also close their online accounts or reduce balances or deposits in favor of products and services offered by competitors for other reasons These shifts which could be rapid could result from general dissatisfaction with our products or services including concerns over pricing online security or our reputation The potential consequences of this competitive environment are exacerbated by the flexibility of direct banking and the financial and technological sophistication of our online customer base In our credit card business competition for rewards customers may result in higher rewards expenses or we may fail to attract new customers or retain existing rewards customers due to increasing competition for these consumers As of December 31 2020 we have a number of large partnerships in our credit card loan portfolio The market for key business partners especially in the credit card business is very competitive and we may not be able to grow or maintain these partner relationships We face the risk that we could lose partner relationships even after we have invested significant resources into acquiring and developing the relationships The loss of any of our key business partners could have a negative impact on our results of operations including lower returns excess operating expense and excess funding capacity We depend on our partners to effectively promote our cobrand and private label products and integrate the use of our credit cards into their retail operations The failure by our partners to effectively promote and support our products as well as changes they may make in their business models could adversely affect card usage and our ability to achieve the growth and profitability objectives of our partnerships In addition if our partners do not adhere to the terms of our program agreements and standards or otherwise diminish the value of our brand we may suffer reputational damage and customers may be less likely to use our products Some of our competitors have developed or may develop substantially greater financial and other resources than we have may offer richer value propositions or a wider range of programs and services than we offer or may use more effective advertising marketing or crossselling strategies to acquire and retain more customers capture a greater share of spending and borrowings attain and develop more attractive cobrand card programs and maintain greater merchant acceptance than we have We may not be able to compete effectively against these threats or respond or adapt to changes in consumer spending habits as effectively as our competitors In such a competitive environment we may lose entire accounts or may lose account balances to competing firms or we may find it more costly to maintain our existing customer base Customer attrition from any or all of our lending products together with any lowering of interest rates or fees that we might implement to retain customers could reduce our revenues and therefore our earnings Similarly unexpected customer attrition from our deposit products in addition to an increase in rates or services that we may offer to retain deposits may increase our expenses and therefore reduce our earnings Our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by merchants increasing focus on the fees charged by credit card networks and by legislation and regulation impacting such fees Credit card interchange fees are generally one of the largest components of the costs that merchants pay in connection with the acceptance of credit cards and are a meaningful source of revenue for our credit card businesses Interchange fees are the subject of significant and intense global legal legislative and regulatory focus and the resulting decisions legislation and regulation may have a material adverse impact on our overall business financial condition and results of operations Legislative and regulatory bodies in a number of countries are seeking to reduce credit card interchange fees through legislation competitionrelated regulatory proceedings central bank regulation and or litigation Interchange reimbursement rates in the United States are set by credit card networks such as MasterCard and Visa In some jurisdictions such as Canada and certain countries in the EU interchange fees and related practices are subject to regulatory activity that has limited the ability of certain networks to establish default rates including in some cases imposing caps on permissible interchange fees We have already experienced these impacts in our international card businesses Legislators and regulators around the world are aware of each others approaches to the regulation of the payments industry Consequently a development in one country state or region may influence regulatory approaches in another such as our primary market the United States In addition to this regulatory activity merchants are also seeking avenues to reduce interchange fees During the past few years merchants and their trade groups have filed numerous lawsuits against Visa MasterCard American Express and their card 34 Capital One Financial Corporation COF Table of Contents issuing banks claiming that their practices toward merchants including interchange and similar fees violate federal antitrust laws In 2005 a number of entities filed antitrust lawsuits against MasterCard and Visa and several member banks including our subsidiaries and us alleging among other things that the defendants conspired to fix the level of interchange fees In December 2013 the US District Court for the Eastern District of New York granted final approval of the proposed class settlement The settlement provided among other things that merchants would be entitled to join together to negotiate lower interchange fees The settlement was appealed to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals which rejected the settlement in June 2016 a revised settlement was reached in the second half of 2018 and the trial court issued its final approval of the settlement in December 2019 See Note 18Commitments Contingencies Guarantees and Others for further details Some major retailers may have sufficient bargaining power to independently negotiate lower interchange fees with MasterCard and Visa which could in turn result in lower interchange fees for us when our cardholders undertake purchase transactions with these retailers In 2016 some of the largest merchants individually negotiated lower interchange rates with MasterCard andor Visa These and other merchants also continue to lobby aggressively for caps and restrictions on interchange fees and their efforts may be successful or they may in the future bring legal proceedings against us or other credit card and debit card issuers and networks Beyond pursuing litigation legislation and regulation merchants may also promote forms of payment with lower fees such as ACHbased payments or seek to impose surcharges at the point of sale for use of credit or debit cards New payment systems particularly mobilebased payment technologies could also gain widespread adoption and lead to issuer transaction fees or the displacement of credit card accounts as a payment method The heightened focus by merchants and legislative and regulatory bodies on the fees charged by credit and debit card networks and the ability of certain merchants to successfully negotiate discounts to interchange fees with MasterCard and Visa or develop alternative payment systems could result in a reduction of interchange fees Any resulting loss in income to us could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations If we are not able to invest successfully in and introduce digital and other technological developments across all our businesses our financial performance may suffer Our industry is subject to rapid and significant technological changes and our ability to meet our customers needs and expectations is key to our ability to grow revenue and earnings We expect digital technologies to have a significant impact on banking over time Consumers expect robust digital experiences from their financial services providers The ability for customers to access their accounts and conduct financial transactions using digital technology including mobile applications is an important aspect of the financial services industry and financial institutions are rapidly introducing new digital and other technologydriven products and services that aim to offer a better customer experience and to reduce costs We continue to invest in digital technology designed to attract new customers facilitate the ability of existing customers to conduct financial transactions and enhance the customer experience related to our products and services Our continued success depends in part upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using digital technology to provide products and services that meet their expectations The development and launch of new digital products and services depends in large part on our capacity to invest in and build the technology platforms that can enable them in a cost effective and timely manner See  We face intense competition in all of our markets  and  We face risks related to our operational technological and organizational infrastructure  Some of our competitors are substantially larger than we are which may allow those competitors to invest more money into their technology infrastructure and digital innovation than we do In addition we face intense competition from smaller companies which experience lower cost structures and different regulatory requirements and scrutiny than we do and which may allow them to innovate more rapidly than we can See  We face intense competition in all of our markets  Further our success depends on our ability to attract and retain strong digital and technology leaders engineers and other specialized personnel The competition is intense and the compensation costs continue to increase for such talent If we are unable to attract and retain digital and technology talent our ability to offer digital products and services and build the necessary technology infrastructure could be negatively affected which could negatively impact our business and financial results A failure to maintain or enhance our competitive position with respect to digital products and services whether because we fail to anticipate customer expectations or because our technological developments fail to perform as desired or are not implemented in a timely or successful manner could negatively impact our business and financial results 35 Capital One Financial Corporation COF Table of Contents We may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of our mergers acquisitions and strategic partnerships We have engaged in merger and acquisition activity and entered into strategic partnerships over the past several years We continue to evaluate and anticipate engaging in among other merger and acquisition activity additional strategic partnerships and selected acquisitions of financial institutions and other acquisition targets including credit card and other loan portfolios We may not be able to identify and secure future acquisition targets on terms and conditions that are acceptable to us or successfully complete within the anticipated time frame and achieve the anticipated benefits of proposed mergers acquisitions and strategic partnerships which could impair our growth Any merger acquisition or strategic partnership we undertake entails certain risks which may materially and adversely affect our results of operations If we experience greater than anticipated costs to integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations or are not able to achieve the anticipated benefits of any merger acquisition or strategic partnership including cost savings and other synergies our business could be negatively affected In addition it is possible that the ongoing integration processes could result in the loss of key employees errors or delays in systems implementation exposure to cybersecurity risks associated with acquired businesses exposure to additional regulatory oversight the disruption of our ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with partners clients customers depositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of any merger acquisition or strategic partnership Integration efforts also may divert management attention and resources These integration matters may have an adverse effect on us during any transition period In addition we may face the following risks in connection with any merger acquisition or strategic partnership  New Businesses and Geographic or Other Markets Our merger acquisition or strategic partnership activity may involve our entry into new businesses and new geographic areas or other markets which present risks resulting from our relative inexperience in these new businesses or markets These new businesses or markets may change the overall character of our consolidated portfolio of businesses and alter our exposure to economic and other external factors We face the risk that we will not be successful in these new businesses or in these new markets  Identification and Assessment of Merger and Acquisition Targets and Deployment of Acquired Assets We may not be able to identify acquire or partner with suitable targets Further our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of any merger acquisition or strategic partnership will depend on our ability to assess the asset quality and value of the particular assets or institutions we partner with merge with or acquire We may be unable to profitably deploy any assets we acquire  Accuracy of Assumptions In connection with any merger acquisition or strategic partnership we may make certain assumptions relating to the proposed merger acquisition or strategic partnership that may be or may prove to be inaccurate including as a result of the failure to realize the expected benefits of any merger acquisition or strategic partnership The inaccuracy of any assumptions we may make could result in unanticipated consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition  Targetspecific Risk Assets and companies that we acquire or companies that we enter into strategic partnerships with will have their own risks that are specific to a particular asset or company These risks include but are not limited to particular or specific regulatory accounting operational reputational and industry risks any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition For example we may face challenges associated with integrating other companies due to differences in corporate culture compliance systems or standards of conduct Indemnification rights if any may be insufficient to compensate us for any losses or damages resulting from such risks In addition to regulatory approvals discussed below certain of our merger acquisition or partnership activity may require thirdparty consents in order for us to fully realize the anticipated benefits of any such transaction  Conditions to Regulatory Approval Certain acquisitions may not be consummated without obtaining approvals from one or more of our regulators We cannot be certain when or if or on what terms and conditions any required regulatory approvals will be granted Consequently we might be required to sell portions of acquired assets or our own assets as a condition to receiving regulatory approval or we may not obtain regulatory approval for a proposed acquisition on acceptable terms or at all in which case we would not be able to complete the acquisition despite the time and expenses invested in pursuing it 36 Capital One Financial Corporation COF Table of Contents Reputational risk and social factors may impact our results and damage our brand Our ability to attract and retain customers is highly dependent upon the perceptions of consumer and commercial borrowers and deposit holders and other external perceptions of our products services trustworthiness business practices workplace culture compliance practices or our financial health In addition our brand is very important to us Maintaining and enhancing our brand depends largely on our ability to continue to provide highquality products and services Adverse perceptions regarding our reputation in the consumer commercial and funding markets could lead to difficulties in generating and maintaining accounts as well as in financing them In particular negative public perceptions regarding our reputation including negative perceptions regarding our ability to maintain the security of our technology systems and protect customer data could lead to decreases in the levels of deposits that consumer and commercial customers and potential customers choose to maintain with us or significantly increase the costs of attracting and retaining customers In addition negative perceptions regarding certain industries partners or clients could also prompt us to cease business activities associated with those entities Negative public opinion or damage to our brand could also result from actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities or circumstances including lending practices regulatory compliance security breaches including the use and protection of customer information such as resulting from the Cybersecurity Incident corporate governance and sales and marketing and from actions taken by regulators or other persons in response to such conduct Such conduct could fall short of our customers and the publics heightened expectations of companies of our size with rigorous data privacy and compliance practices and could further harm our reputation In addition our cobrand and private label partners or other third parties with whom we have important relationships may take actions over which we have limited control that could negatively impact perceptions about us or the financial services industry The proliferation of social media may increase the likelihood that negative public opinion from any of the events discussed above will impact our reputation and business In addition a variety of social factors may cause changes in borrowing activity including credit card use payment patterns and the rate of defaults by account holders and borrowers domestically and internationally These social factors include changes in consumer confidence levels the publics perception regarding the banking industry and consumer debt including credit card use and changing attitudes about the stigma of bankruptcy If consumers develop or maintain negative attitudes about incurring debt or if consumption trends decline or if we fail to maintain and enhance our brand or we incur significant expenses to do so our business and financial results could be materially and negatively affected If we are not able to protect our intellectual property our revenue and profitability could be negatively affected We rely on a variety of measures to protect and enhance our intellectual property including copyrights trademarks trade secrets patents and certain restrictions on disclosure solicitation and competition We also undertake other measures to control access to and distribution of our other proprietary information These measures may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information or infringement of our intellectual property rights and a resulting loss of competitive advantage In addition our competitors or other third parties may file patent applications for innovations that are used in our industry or allege that our systems processes or technologies infringe on their intellectual property rights If our competitors or other third parties are successful in obtaining such patents or prevail in intellectual propertyrelated litigation against us we could lose significant revenues incur significant license royalty or technology development expenses or pay significant damages Our risk management strategies may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposures in all market environments or against all types of risk Management of market credit liquidity operational and compliance risk requires among other things policies and procedures to properly record and verify a large number of transactions and events See MDARisk Management for further details Even though we continue to devote significant resources to developing our risk management framework our risk management strategies may not be fully effective in identifying and mitigating our risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk including risks that are unidentified or unanticipated Some of our methods of managing these risks are based upon our use of observed historical market behavior and managements judgment These methods may not accurately predict future exposures which could be significantly greater than the historical measures indicate and market conditions particularly during a period of financial market stress can involve unprecedented dislocations Credit risk is inherent in the financial services business and results from among other things extending credit to customers Our ability to assess the creditworthiness of our customers may be impaired if the models and approaches we use to select manage and underwrite our consumer and commercial customers become less predictive of future chargeoffs due for example to rapid changes in the economy including rapid changes in tariff rates and international trade relations 37 Capital One Financial Corporation COF Table of Contents While we employ a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and risk mitigation techniques those techniques and the judgments that accompany their application cannot anticipate every economic and financial outcome or the timing of such outcomes For example our ability to implement our risk management strategies may be hindered by adverse changes in the volatility or liquidity conditions in certain markets and as a result may limit our ability to distribute such risks for instance when we seek to syndicate exposure in bridge financing transactions we have underwritten We may therefore incur losses in the course of our risk management or investing activities Fluctuations in market interest rates or volatility in the capital markets could adversely affect our income and expense the value of assets and obligations our regulatory capital cost of capital or liquidity Like other financial institutions our business is sensitive to market interest rate movements and the performance of the capital markets Disruptions uncertainty or volatility across the capital markets could negatively impact market liquidity and limit our access to the funding required to operate and grow our business In addition changes in interest rates or in valuations in the debt or equity markets could directly impact us For example we borrow money from other institutions and depositors which we use to make loans to customers and invest in debt securities and other interestearning assets We earn interest on these loans and assets and pay interest on the money we borrow from institutions and depositors The interest rates that we pay on the securities we have issued are also influenced by among other things applicable credit ratings from recognized rating agencies A downgrade to any of these credit ratings could affect our ability to access the capital markets increase our borrowing costs and have a negative impact on our results of operations Increased chargeoffs rising LIBOR or other applicable reference rates and other events may cause our securitization transactions to amortize earlier than scheduled which could accelerate our need for additional funding from other sources Fluctuations in interest rates including changes in the relationship between shortterm rates and longterm rates and in the relationship between our funding basis rate and our lending basis rate may have negative impacts on our net interest income and therefore our earnings In addition interest rate fluctuations and competitor responses to those changes may affect the rate of customer prepayments for auto and other term loans and may affect the balances customers carry on their credit cards For example increases in interest rates increase debt service requirements for some of our borrowers which may adversely affect those borrowers ability to pay as contractually obligated This could result in additional delinquencies or chargeoffs and negatively impact our results of operations These changes can reduce the overall yield on our interestearning asset portfolio Changes in interest rates and competitor responses to these changes may also impact customer decisions to maintain balances in the deposit accounts they have with us An inability to attract or maintain deposits could materially affect our ability to fund our business and our liquidity position Many other financial institutions have increased their reliance on deposit funding and as such we expect continued competition in the deposit markets We cannot predict how this competition will affect our costs If we are required to offer higher interest rates to attract or maintain deposits our funding costs will be adversely impacted Changes in valuations in the debt and equity markets could have a negative impact on the assets we hold in our investment portfolio Such market changes could also have a negative impact on the valuation of assets for which we provide servicing We assess our interest rate risk by estimating the effect on our earnings economic value and capital under various scenarios that differ based on assumptions about the direction and the magnitude of interest rate changes We take risk mitigation actions based on those assessments We face the risk that changes in interest rates could materially reduce our net interest income and our earnings especially if actual conditions turn out to be materially different than those we assumed See MDAMarket Risk Profile for additional information Uncertainty regarding and transition away from LIBOR may adversely affect our business The UK FCA which regulates LIBOR has announced that it will no longer compel banks to contribute data for the calculation of LIBOR after December 31 2021 It is likely that banks will no longer continue to contribute submissions for the calculation of LIBOR after that date which creates significant uncertainty around the publication of LIBOR beyond 2021 and whether LIBOR will continue to be viewed as a reliable market benchmark In November 2020 the ICE Benchmark Administration IBA the administrator of LIBOR announced that it will consult on its intention to cease publication of the 1week and 2month USD LIBOR settings immediately following the LIBOR publication on December 31 2021 and the remaining USD LIBOR tenors Overnight 1 3 6 and 12 Months immediately following the LIBOR publication on June 30 2023 The consultation closed on January 25 2021 and we will continue to engage with industry experts to better understand the proposed IBAs extension announcement and its impact on the markets and our transition plans It remains unclear what rate or rates may develop as accepted alternatives to LIBOR or what the effect of such changes will be on the markets for LIBORbased financial instruments The Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR has been recommended by the Alternative 38 Capital One Financial Corporation COF Table of Contents Reference Rates Committee as an alternative for USD LIBOR but issues and uncertainty remain with respect to its implementation Given LIBORs extensive use across financial markets the transition away from LIBOR presents several risks and challenges to the financial markets and financial institutions including Capital One We have loans derivative contracts unsecured debt securitizations vendor agreements and other instruments with attributes that are either directly or indirectly dependent on LIBOR Uncertainty as to the nature of potential changes alternative reference rates such as SOFR or other reforms may adversely affect market liquidity the pricing of LIBORbased instruments and the availability and cost of associated hedging instruments and borrowings If SOFR or another rate does not achieve wide acceptance as the alternative to LIBOR there likely will be disruption to the markets relying on the availability of a broadly accepted reference rate In addition uncertainty regarding LIBOR could result in loss of market share in certain products adverse tax or accounting impacts compliance legal or operational costs and risks associated with client disclosures as well as systems disruption model disruption and other business continuity issues for us Even if SOFR or another reference rate becomes a widely acceptable replacement for LIBOR risks will remain for us with respect to outstanding instruments which rely on LIBOR Those risks arise in connection with transitioning such instruments to a new reference rate the taking of discretionary actions or the negotiation of fallback provisions and final amendments to existing LIBOR based agreements Payments under contracts referencing new reference rates may significantly differ from those referencing LIBOR For some instruments the method of transitioning to a new reference rate may be challenging especially if parties to an instrument cannot agree as to how to effect that transition If a contract is not transitioned to a new reference rate and LIBOR ceases to exist the impact on our obligations is likely to vary by contract In addition prior to LIBOR cessation instruments that continue to refer to LIBOR may be impacted if there is a change in the availability or calculation of LIBOR The transition from LIBOR to an alternative reference rate may change our market risk profile and require changes to risk and pricing models valuation tools product design information technology systems reporting infrastructure operational processes and controls and hedging strategies In many cases we may be dependent on third parties to upgrade systems software and other critical functions that could materially disrupt our readiness if they are not done on a timely basis or otherwise fail Our assessment of the ultimate impact of and our planning for the transition from LIBOR remains ongoing Failure to adequately manage the transition could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition and results of operations See MDAMarket Risk Profile for additional information Our business could be negatively affected if we are unable to attract retain and motivate skilled employees Our success depends in large part on our ability to retain key senior leaders and to attract and retain skilled employees particularly employees with advanced expertise in credit risk digital and technology skills We depend on our senior leaders and skilled employees to oversee simultaneous transformative initiatives across the enterprise and execute on our business plans in an efficient and effective manner Competition for such senior leaders and employees and the costs associated with attracting and retaining them is high Our ability to attract and retain qualified employees also is affected by perceptions of our culture and management our profile in the regions where we have offices and the professional opportunities we offer Regulation or regulatory guidance restricting executive compensation as well as evolving investor expectations may limit the types of compensation arrangements that we may enter into with our most senior leaders and could have a negative impact on our ability to attract retain and motivate such leaders in support of our longterm strategy These laws and regulations may not apply in the same manner to all financial institutions and we therefore may face more restrictions than other institutions and companies with which we compete for talent These laws and regulations may also hinder our ability to compete for talent with other industries We rely upon our senior leaders not only for business success but also to lead with integrity To the extent our senior leaders behave in a manner that does not comport with our values the consequences to our brand and reputation could be severe and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations If we are unable to attract develop and retain talented senior leadership and employees or to implement appropriate succession plans for our senior leadership our business could be negatively affected We face risks from unpredictable catastrophic events Despite the business contingency plans we have in place such plans do not fully mitigate all potential business continuity risks to us Natural disasters and other catastrophic events could harm our business and infrastructure including our information technology systems and thirdparty platforms Our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our business and the communities where we are located which are concentrated in the Northern Virginia and New York metropolitan areas as well as Richmond Virginia and Plano Texas This may include a disruption involving damage or loss of access to a physical site cyber incidents terrorist activities the occurrence or worsening of disease 39 Capital One Financial Corporation COF Table of Contents outbreaks or pandemics including the COVID19 pandemic natural disasters extreme weather events electrical outage environmental hazard technological infrastructure communications or other services we use our employees or third parties with whom we conduct business Our business financial condition and results of operations may be impacted by any such disruption and our ability to implement corresponding response measures including for example our ability to adapt to a remote work environment as a result of the ongoing COVID19 pandemic and related response measures In addition if a natural disaster or other catastrophic event occurs in certain regions where our business and customers are concentrated such as the midAtlantic New York or Texas metropolitan areas we could be disproportionately impacted as compared to our competitors The impact of such events and other catastrophes on the overall economy may also adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations We face risks from the use of or changes to assumptions or estimates in our financial statements Pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles in the US US GAAP we are required to use certain assumptions and estimates in preparing our financial statements including determining our allowance for credit losses the fair value of certain assets and liabilities and asset impairment among other items In addition the FASB the SEC and other regulatory bodies may change the financial accounting and reporting standards including those related to assumptions and estimates we use to prepare our financial statements in ways that we cannot predict and that could impact our financial statements If actual results differ from the assumptions or estimates underlying our financial statements or if financial accounting and reporting standards are changed we may experience unexpected material losses For a discussion of our use of estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements see MDACritical Accounting Policies and Estimates and Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Limitations on our ability to receive dividends from our subsidiaries could affect our liquidity and ability to pay dividends and repurchase common stock We are a separate and distinct legal entity from our subsidiaries including the Banks Dividends to us from our direct and indirect subsidiaries including the Banks have represented a major source of funds for us to pay dividends on our common and preferred stock repurchase common stock make payments on corporate debt securities and meet other obligations There are various federal law limitations on the extent to which the Banks can finance or otherwise supply funds to us through dividends and loans These limitations include minimum regulatory capital requirements federal banking law requirements concerning the payment of dividends out of net profits or surplus Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation W governing transactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliates as well as general federal regulatory oversight to prevent unsafe or unsound practices If our subsidiaries earnings are not sufficient to make dividend payments to us while maintaining adequate capital levels our liquidity may be affected and we may not be able to make dividend payments to our common or preferred stockholders repurchase our common stock make payments on outstanding corporate debt securities or meet other obligations each and any of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial position or perception of financial health See Part IItem 1BusinessSupervision and Regulation for additional information regarding dividend limitations applicable to us and the Banks The soundness of other financial institutions and other third parties could adversely affect us Our ability to engage in routine funding and other transactions could be adversely affected by the stability and actions of other financial services institutions Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading clearing servicing counterparty and other relationships We have exposure to financial institutions intermediaries and counterparties that are exposed to risks over which we have little or no control In addition we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients resulting in a significant credit concentration with respect to the financial services industry overall As a result defaults by or even rumors or questions about one or more financial services institutions or the financial services industry generally have led to marketwide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions Likewise adverse developments affecting the overall strength and soundness of our competitors the financial services industry as a whole and the general economic climate or sovereign debt could have a negative impact on perceptions about the strength and soundness of our business even if we are not subject to the same adverse developments In addition adverse developments with respect to third parties with whom we have important relationships also could negatively impact perceptions about us These perceptions about us could cause our business to be negatively affected and exacerbate the other risks that we face 40 Capital One Financial Corporation COF Table of Contents Item 1B Unresolved
