CareFusion product lines are included in our Medical Segment which is discussed below In March 2016 BD signed a definitive agreement to sell 501 of its Respiratory Solutions business and form a joint venture with respect to this business The Respiratory Solutions business was acquired in the CareFusion acquisition in 2015 and was a component of the Medical segment Upon closing of the transaction which occurred on October 3 2016 the Company transferred the Respiratory Solutions business to a new standalone entity retaining a 499 noncontrolling interest The buyer controls the operations and governance of the new entity Additional information regarding this Respiratory Solutions transaction is contained in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data which is incorporated herein by reference International Operations BDs products are manufactured and sold worldwide For reporting purposes we organize our operations outside the United States as follows Europe EMA which includes the Commonwealth of Independent States the Middle East and Africa Greater Asia which includes Japan and Asia Pacific Latin America which includes Mexico Central America the Caribbean and South America and Canada The principal products sold by BD outside the United States are hypodermic needles and syringes insulin syringes and pen needles BD Hypak brand prefillable syringe systems infusion therapy products including Alaris infusion pumps pharmacy automation equipment including Pyxis systems BD Vacutainer brand blood collection products diagnostic systems and laboratory equipment and products flow cytometry instruments and reagents BD has manufacturing operations outside the United States in Bosnia and Herzegovina Brazil Canada China Dominican Republic France Germany Hungary India Ireland Italy Japan Mexico the Netherlands Singapore Spain and the United Kingdom Geographic information with respect to BDs operations is included under the heading Geographic Information in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data and is incorporated herein by reference Foreign economic conditions and exchange rate fluctuations have caused the profitability related to foreign revenues to fluctuate more than the profitability related to domestic revenues BD believes its activities in some countries outside the United States involve greater risk than its domestic business due to the factors cited herein as well as the economic environment local commercial and economic policies and political uncertainties See further discussion of this risk in Item 1A Risk Factors Distribution BDs products are marketed in the United States and internationally through independent distribution channels and directly to endusers by BD and independent sales representatives Order backlog is not material to BDs business inasmuch as orders for BD products generally are received and filled on a current basis except for items temporarily out of stock BDs worldwide sales are not generally seasonal with the exception of certain medical devices in the Medication and Procedural Solutions Business Unit and respiratory and flu diagnostic products in the Diagnostic Systems Business Unit which relate to seasonal diseases such as influenza Raw Materials 2 Table of Contents BD purchases many different types of raw materials including plastics glass metals textiles paper products agricultural products electronic and mechanical subassemblies and various biological chemical and petrochemical products BD seeks to ensure continuity of raw material supply by securing multiple options for sourcing However there are situations where raw materials are only available from one supplier which are referred to as sole sourced The use of sole sourced materials may be due to sourcing of proprietary andor patented technology and processes that are intended to provide a unique market differentiation to our product In other cases while a raw material can be sourced from multiple manufacturers only one supplier is qualified due to quality assurance cost or other considerations In order to provide alternate sources of raw materials BD must complete a rigorous qualification process which most often includes completion of regulatory registration and approval If clinical trials are not required this qualification process can take 318 months depending on the criticality of the change When clinical trials are required this process may lengthen the qualification phase from one to three years BD continuously assesses its sole sourced raw materials and maintains business continuity plans with our suppliers BDs continuity plans may include securing secondary supply with alternate suppliers qualification of alternate manufacturing facilities maintaining contingency stock internal development of supply and establishment of technology escrow accounts While BD works closely with its suppliers there may nonetheless be events that cause supply interruption reduction or termination that adversely impacts BDs ability to manufacture and sell certain products Research and Development BD conducts its research and development RD activities at its operating units and at BD Technologies in Research Triangle Park North Carolina The majority of BDs RD activities are conducted in North America Outside North America BD conducts RD activities in China France India Ireland and Singapore BD also collaborates with certain universities medical centers and other entities on RD programs and retains individual consultants and partners to support its efforts in specialized fields BD spent approximately 828 million 632 million and 550 million on research and development during the fiscal years ended September 30 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively Intellectual Property and Licenses BD owns significant intellectual property including patents patent applications technology trade secrets knowhow copyrights and trademarks in the United States and other countries BD is also licensed under domestic and foreign patents patent applications technology trade secrets knowhow copyrights and trademarks owned by others In the aggregate these intellectual property assets and licenses are of material importance to BDs business BD believes however that no single patent technology trademark intellectual property asset or license is material in relation to BDs business as a whole or to any business segment Competition BD operates in the increasingly complex and challenging medical technology marketplace Technological advances and scientific discoveries have accelerated the pace of change in medical technology the regulatory environment of medical products is becoming more complex and vigorous and economic conditions have resulted in a challenging market Companies of varying sizes compete in the global medical technology field Some are more specialized than BD with respect to particular markets and some have greater financial resources than BD New companies have entered the field particularly in the areas of molecular diagnostics safetyengineered devices and in the life sciences and established companies have diversified their business activities into the medical technology area Other firms engaged in the distribution of medical technology products have become manufacturers of medical devices and instruments as well Acquisitions and collaborations by and among companies seeking a competitive advantage also affect the competitive environment In addition the entry into the market of manufacturers located in China and other lowcost manufacturing locations are creating increased pricing pressures particularly in developing markets Some competitors have also established manufacturing sites or have contracted with suppliers located in these countries as a means to lower their costs BD competes in this evolving marketplace on the basis of many factors including price quality innovation service reputation distribution and promotion The impact of these factors on BDs competitive position varies among BDs various product offerings In order to remain competitive in the industries in which it operates BD continues to make investments in research and development quality management quality improvement product innovation and productivity improvement in support of its core strategy  to increase revenue growth by focusing on products that deliver greater benefits to patients healthcare workers and researchers ThirdParty Reimbursement A majority of BDs customers rely on thirdparty payers including government programs and private health insurance plans to reimburse some or all of the cost of the procedures products and services they provide Our technologies are subject to worldwide regulations regarding reimbursement developed by government agencies including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services CMS in the United States the National Health Service in the United Kingdom the Joint Federal Committee in Germany the Commission dEvaluation des Produits et prestations in France the Ministry for Health Labor and 3 Table of Contents Welfare in Japan the Ministry of Health and the National Development and Reform Commission in China among many others In addition our technologies are also subject to reimbursement policies issued by private insurance companies and managed care organizations BD is actively engaged in identifying and communicating value propositions of its products for payer provider and patient stakeholders and it employs various efforts and resources to positively impact coverage coding and payment pathways However BD has no direct control over payer decisionmaking with respect to coverage and payment levels for BD products The manner and level of reimbursement in any given case may depend on the site of care the procedures performed the final patient diagnosis the devices andor drugs utilized the available budget or a combination of these factors and coverage and payment levels are determined at each payers discretion As BDs product offerings are diverse across a variety of healthcare settings they are affected to varying degrees by the many payment pathways that impact the decisions of healthcare providers regarding which medical products they purchase and the prices they are willing to pay for those products Therefore changes in reimbursement levels or methods may either positively or negatively impact sales of BD products in any given country for any given product As government programs seek to expand healthcare coverage for their citizens they have at the same time sought to control costs by limiting the amount of reimbursement they will pay for particular procedures products or services Many thirdparty payers have developed specific payment and delivery mechanisms to support these cost control efforts and to focus on paying for value These mechanisms include payment reductions pay for performance measures qualitybased performance payments restrictive coverage policies bidding and tender mechanics studies to compare the effectiveness of therapies and use of technology assessments These changes have created an increased emphasis on the delivery of more costeffective and qualitydriven healthcare In addition as a result of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act PPACA the US is now moving beyond value based payment methodologies and seeking to create alternative payment models such as bundled payments to continue to drive improved value We see other governments around the world considering similar bundling reform measures including the development of the Diagnosis Related Group DRG as a payment mechanism to drive toward quality and resource based reimbursement See Item 1A Risk Factors for a further discussion Regulation BDs medical technology products and operations are subject to regulation by the US Food and Drug Administration FDA and various other federal and state agencies as well as by foreign governmental agencies These agencies enforce laws and regulations that govern the development testing manufacturing labeling advertising marketing and distribution and market surveillance of BDs medical products The scope of the activities of these agencies particularly in the Europe Japan and Asia Pacific regions in which BD operates has been increasing BD actively maintains FDAISO Quality Systems that establish standards for its product design manufacturing and distribution processes Prior to marketing or selling most of its products BD must secure approval from the FDA and counterpart nonUS regulatory agencies Following the introduction of a product these agencies engage in periodic reviews and inspections of BDs quality systems as well as product performance and advertising and promotional materials These regulatory controls as well as any changes in FDA policies can affect the time and cost associated with the development introduction and continued availability of new products Where possible BD anticipates these factors in its product development and planning processes These agencies possess the authority to take various administrative and legal actions against BD such as product recalls product seizures and other civil and criminal sanctions BD also undertakes voluntary compliance actions such as voluntary recalls BD also is subject to various federal and state laws and laws outside the United States concerning healthcare fraud and abuse including false claims laws and antikickback laws global anticorruption transportation safety and health and customs and exports Many of the agencies enforcing these laws have increased their enforcement activities with respect to medical device manufacturers in recent years This appears to be part of a general trend toward increased regulation and enforcement activity within and outside the United States In addition as part of PPACA the federal government has enacted the Sunshine Act provisions requiring BD to publicly report gifts and payments made to physicians and teaching hospitals Many of these provisions are new and uncertain and failure to comply could result in a range of fines penalties andor other sanctions Our infusion pump business unit is operating under an amended consent decree entered into by CareFusion with the FDA in 2007 CareFusions consent decree with the FDA related to its Alaris SE infusion pumps In February 2009 CareFusion and the FDA amended the consent decree to include all infusion pumps manufactured by or for CareFusion 303 Inc the business unit that manufactures and sells infusion pumps in the United States The amended consent decree does not apply to intravenous administration sets and accessories 4 Table of Contents While this BD business unit remains subject to the amended consent decree which includes the requirements of the original consent decree it has made substantial progress in its compliance efforts However we cannot predict the outcome of this matter and the amended consent decree authorizes the FDA in the event of any violations in the future to order us to cease manufacturing and distributing infusion pumps recall products and take other actions We may be required to pay damages of 15000 per day per violation if we fail to comply with any provision of the amended consent decree up to 15 million per year We also cannot currently predict whether additional monetary investment will be incurred to resolve this matter or the matters ultimate impact on our business We may be obligated to pay more costs in the future because among other things the FDA may determine that we are not fully compliant with the amended consent decree and therefore impose penalties under the amended consent decree andor we may be subject to future proceedings and litigation relating to the matters addressed in the amended consent decree As of September 30 2016 we do not believe that a loss is probable in connection with the amended consent decree and accordingly we have no accruals associated with compliance with the amended consent decree See also Item 3 Legal Proceedings Employees As of September 30 2016 BD had 50928 employees of which 18480 were employed in the US including Puerto Rico BD believes that its employee relations are satisfactory Available Information BD maintains a website at wwwbdcom BD also makes available its Annual Reports on Form 10K its Quarterly

BDs press releases SEC filings and public conference calls and webcasts Our website and the information contained therein or connected thereto shall not be deemed to be incorporated into this Annual Report ForwardLooking Statements BD and its representatives may from timetotime make certain forwardlooking statements in publiclyreleased materials both written and oral including statements contained in filings with the SEC and in its reports to shareholders Additional information regarding BDs forwardlooking statements is contained in Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Item 1A Risk Factors An investment in BD involves a variety of risks and uncertainties The following describes some of the significant risks that could adversely affect BDs business financial condition operating results or cash flows Risks Relating to the Company Global economic conditions could adversely affect our operations Deterioration in the global economic environment particularly in emerging markets and countries with governmentsponsored healthcare systems may cause decreased demand for our products and services and increased competition which could result in lower sales volume and downward pressure on the prices for our products longer sales cycles and slower adoption of new technologies A weakening of macroeconomic conditions may also adversely affect our suppliers which could result in interruptions in supply We have also previously experienced delays in collecting government receivables in certain countries in Western Europe due to economic conditions and we may experience similar delays in the future in these and other countries or regions experiencing financial problems 5 Table of Contents The medical technology industry is very competitive We are a global company that faces significant competition from a wide range of companies These include large medical device companies with multiple product lines some of which may have greater financial and marketing resources than we do and firms that are more specialized than we are with respect to particular markets or product lines We face competition across all our product lines and in each market in which our products are sold on the basis of product features clinical outcomes product quality price services and other factors In addition we face changing customer preferences and requirements including increased customer demand for more environmentallyfriendly products The medical technology industry is also subject to rapid technological change and discovery The development of new or improved products processes or technologies by other companies such as needlefree injection technology may render our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive In some instances competitors including pharmaceutical companies also offer or are attempting to develop alternative therapies for disease states that may be delivered without a medical device The entry into the market of manufacturers located in China and other lowcost manufacturing locations has also created pricing pressure particularly in developing markets We are subject to foreign currency exchange risk A substantial amount of our revenues are derived from international operations and we anticipate that a significant portion of our sales will continue to come from outside the US in the future The revenues we report with respect to our operations outside the United States may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates A discussion of the financial impact of exchange rate fluctuations and the ways and extent to which we may attempt to address any impact is contained in Item 7 Managements Discussion of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Any hedging activities we engage in may only offset a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates We cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the degree to which we can mitigate these risks Changes in reimbursement practices of thirdparty payers could affect the demand for our products and the prices at which they are sold Our sales depend in part on the extent to which healthcare providers and facilities are reimbursed by government authorities private insurers and other thirdparty payers for the costs of our products The coverage policies and reimbursement levels of thirdparty payers which can vary among public and private sources and by country may affect which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay for those products in a particular jurisdiction Reimbursement rates can also affect the acceptance rate of new technologies and products Legislative or administrative reforms to reimbursement systems in the United States or abroad changes in reimbursement rates by private payers or adverse decisions relating to our products by administrators of these systems could significantly reduce reimbursement for procedures using our products or result in denial of reimbursement for those products which would adversely affect customer demand or the price customers are willing to pay for such products See ThirdParty Reimbursement under Item 1 Business Federal healthcare reform may adversely affect our results of operations The PPACA imposes on medical device manufacturers such as BD a 23 excise tax on US sales of certain medical devices While the excise tax has been suspended until the end of 2017 it may be reinstated in 2018 or beyond In addition the PPACA among other things reduces Medicare and Medicaid payments to hospitals clinical laboratories and pharmaceutical companies and could otherwise reduce the volume of medical procedures These factors in turn could result in reduced demand for our products and increased downward pricing pressure It is also possible that the PPACA will result in lower reimbursement rates for our products Other provisions in the law may significantly change the practice of health care and could adversely affect aspects of our business Consolidation in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our future revenues and operating income The medical technology industry has experienced a significant amount of consolidation resulting in companies with greater market presence Health care systems and other health care companies are also consolidating resulting in greater purchasing power for these companies As a result competition among medical device suppliers to provide goods and services has increased Group purchasing organizations and integrated health delivery networks have also served to concentrate purchasing decisions for some customers which has led to downward pricing pressure for medical device suppliers Further consolidation in the industry could intensify competition among medical device suppliers and exert additional pressure on the prices of our products Cost volatility could adversely affect our operations Our results of operations could be negatively impacted by volatility in the cost of raw materials components freight and energy that increases the costs of producing and distributing our products New laws or regulations adopted in response to 6 Table of Contents climate change could also increase energy costs as well as the costs of certain raw materials and components In particular we purchase supplies of resins which are oilbased components used in the manufacture of certain products and any significant increases in resin costs could adversely impact future operating results Increases in oil prices can also increase our packaging and transportation costs We may not be able to offset any increases in these operational costs Breaches of our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our operations We rely on information technology systems to process transmit and store electronic information in our daytoday operations including sensitive personal information and proprietary or confidential information In addition some of our products include information technology that collects data regarding patients and patient therapy on behalf of our customers and some connect to our systems for maintenance purposes Our information technology systems have been subjected to attack via malicious code execution cyber or phishing attacks and we have experienced instances of unauthorized access to our systems in the past and expect to be subject to similar attacks in the future In addition to our own information in the course of doing business we sometimes store information with third parties that could be subject to these types of attacks Cyberattacks could result in our intellectual property and other confidential information being accessed or stolen Likewise we could suffer disruption of our operations and other significant negative consequences including increased costs for security measures or remediation diversion of management attention and adverse impact on our relationships with vendors business partners and customers Unauthorized tampering adulteration or interference with our products may also create issues with product functionality that could result in a loss of data risk to patient safety and product recalls or field actions Our lack of success in preventing unauthorized access to our systems and products could also result in actions by regulatory bodies or civil litigation While we will continue to dedicate significant resources to protect the company against unauthorized access to our systems and work with government authorities to detect and reduce the risk of future cyber incidents cyberattacks are becoming more sophisticated frequent and adaptive There can be no assurances that our protective measures will prevent future attacks that could have a material adverse impact on our business Our future growth is dependent in part upon the development of new products and there can be no assurance that such products will be developed A significant element of our strategy is to increase revenue growth by focusing on product offerings that deliver greater benefits to patients healthcare workers and researchers The development of these products requires significant investment in research and development clinical trials and regulatory approvals The results of our product development efforts may be affected by a number of factors including our ability to anticipate customer needs innovate and develop new products and technologies successfully complete clinical trials obtain regulatory approvals and reimbursement in the United States and abroad manufacture products in a costeffective manner obtain appropriate intellectual property protection for our products and gain and maintain market acceptance of our products In addition patents attained by others can preclude or delay our commercialization of a product There can be no assurance that any products now in development or that we may seek to develop in the future will achieve technological feasibility obtain regulatory approval or gain market acceptance We cannot guarantee that any of our strategic acquisitions investments or alliances will be successful We may seek to supplement our internal growth through strategic acquisitions investments and alliances Such transactions are inherently risky and the integration of any newlyacquired business requires significant effort and management attention The success of any acquisition investment or alliance may be affected by a number of factors including our ability to properly assess and value the potential business opportunity or to successfully integrate any business we may acquire into our existing business There can be no assurance that any past or future transaction will be successful The international operations of our business may subject us to certain business risks A substantial amount of our sales come from our operations outside the United States and we intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in foreign markets especially in emerging markets Our foreign operations subject us to certain risks including the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange discussed above the effects of local economic and political conditions foreign regulatory requirements or changes in such requirements local product preferences and product requirements difficulty in establishing staffing and managing foreign operations differing labor regulations changes in tax laws potential political instability weakening or loss of the protection of intellectual property rights in some countries import or export licensing requirements trade protection measures and restrictions on the transfer of capital across borders The success of our operations outside the United States depends in part on our ability to acquire or form and maintain alliances with local companies and make necessary infrastructure enhancements to among other things our production facilities and sales and distribution networks The June 2016 referendum by British voters to exit the European Union EU commonly known as Brexit has created uncertainties affecting business operations in the United Kingdom UK and the EU Following the vote there was a significant decline in the value of the British pound compared to the US dollar and there may be continued volatility in exchange rates and economic conditions as the UK negotiates its exit from the EU Until the terms and timing of the UKs exit 7 Table of Contents from the EU are determined it is difficult to predict its impact It is possible that the referendum and proposed withdrawal could among other things affect the legal and regulatory schemes to which our businesses are subject impact trade between the UK and the EU and other parties and create economic uncertainty in the region In addition our international operations are governed by the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anticorruption laws outside the US Global enforcement of anticorruption laws has increased substantially in recent years with more enforcement proceedings by US and foreign governmental agencies and the imposition of significant fines and penalties While we have implemented policies and procedures to enhance compliance with these laws our international operations which often involve customer relationships with foreign governments create the risk that there may be unauthorized payments or offers of payments made by employees consultants sales agents or distributors Any alleged or actual violations of these laws may subject us to government investigations significant criminal or civil sanctions and other liabilities and negatively affect our reputation Under the US tax code we may also be subject to additional taxation to the extent we repatriate earnings from our foreign operations to the US In the event we require more capital in the United States than is generated by our US operations to fund acquisitions or other activities and elect to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions our effective tax rate may be higher as a result Reductions in customers research budgets or government funding may adversely affect our business We sell products to researchers at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies academic institutions government laboratories and private foundations Research and development spending of our customers can fluctuate based on spending priorities and general economic conditions A number of these customers are also dependent for their funding upon grants from US government agencies such as the US National Institutes of Health NIH and agencies in other countries The level of government funding of research and development is unpredictable For instance there have been instances where NIH grants have been frozen or otherwise unavailable for extended periods The availability of governmental research funding may be adversely affected by economic conditions and governmental spending reductions Any reduction or delay in governmental funding could cause our customers to delay or forego purchases of our products A reduction or interruption in the supply of certain raw materials and components would adversely affect our manufacturing operations and related product sales We purchase many different types of raw materials and components used in our products Certain raw materials and components are not available from multiple sources In addition for quality assurance costeffectiveness and other reasons we elect to purchase certain raw materials and components from sole suppliers The supply of these materials can be disrupted for a number of reasons including economic conditions as described above While we work with suppliers to ensure continuity of supply no assurance can be given that these efforts will be successful In addition due to regulatory requirements relating to the qualification of suppliers we may not be able to establish additional or replacement sources on a timely basis or without excessive cost The termination reduction or interruption in supply of these solesourced raw materials and components could adversely impact our ability to manufacture and sell certain of our products Interruption of our manufacturing operations could adversely affect our future revenues and operating income We have manufacturing sites all over the world In some instances however the manufacturing of certain of our product lines is concentrated in one or more of our plants Damage to one or more of these facilities from weather or natural disasters or issues in our manufacturing process equipment failure or other factors could adversely affect our ability to manufacture these products resulting in lost revenues and damage to our relationships with customers We are subject to lawsuits We are or have been a defendant in a number of lawsuits including purported class action lawsuits for alleged antitrust violations and suits alleging patent infringement and could be subject to additional lawsuits in the future A more detailed description of these lawsuits is contained in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Given the uncertain nature of litigation generally we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the litigation to which we are a party In view of these uncertainties we could incur charges in excess of any currently established accruals and to the extent available excess liability insurance Any such future charges individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows We are subject to extensive regulation Our operations are global and are affected by complex state federal and international laws relating to healthcare environmental protection antitrust anticorruption fraud and abuse including antikickback and false claims laws export control employment and other areas Violations of these laws can result in criminal or civil sanctions including substantial 8 Table of Contents fines and in some cases exclusion from participation in health care programs such as Medicare and Medicaid Environmental laws particularly with respect to the emission of greenhouse gases are also becoming more stringent throughout the world which may increase our costs of operations or necessitate changes in our manufacturing plants or processes or those of our suppliers or result in liability to BD if we violate such laws The enactment of additional laws in the future may increase our compliance costs or otherwise adversely impact our operations We are also subject to extensive regulation by the FDA pursuant to the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act by comparable agencies in foreign countries and by other regulatory agencies and governing bodies Most of our products must receive clearance or approval from the FDA or counterpart regulatory agencies in other countries before they can be marketed or sold The process for obtaining marketing approval or clearance may take a significant period of time and require the expenditure of substantial resources and these have been increasing due to increased requirements from the FDA for supporting data for submissions The process may also require changes to our products or result in limitations on the indicated uses of the products Governmental agencies may also impose new requirements regarding registration labeling or prohibited materials that may require us to modify or reregister products already on the market or otherwise impact our ability to market our products in those countries Once clearance or approval has been obtained for a product there is an obligation to ensure that all applicable FDA and other regulatory requirements continue to be met Following the introduction of a product these agencies also periodically review our manufacturing processes and product performance Our failure to comply with the applicable good manufacturing practices adverse event reporting clinical trial and other requirements of these agencies could delay or prevent the production marketing or sale of our products and result in fines delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances closure of manufacturing sites seizures or recalls of products and damage to our reputation More stringent oversight by the FDA and other agencies in recent years has resulted in increased enforcement activity which increases the compliance risk for us and other companies in our industry As a result of the CareFusion acquisition we are operating under a consent decree with the FDA that was entered into by CareFusion in 2009 that affects our infusion pump business in the United States For more information regarding the consent decree see Regulation under Item 1 Business Product defects could adversely affect the results of our operations The design manufacture and marketing of medical devices involve certain inherent risks Manufacturing or design defects unapproved use of our products or inadequate disclosure of risks or other information relating to the use of our products can lead to injury or other adverse events These events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products either voluntary or required by the FDA or similar governmental authorities in other countries and could result in certain cases in the removal of a product from the market A recall could result in significant costs and lost sales as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce future demand for our products Personal injuries relating to the use of our products can also result in significant product liability claims being brought against us In some circumstances such adverse events could also cause delays in regulatory approval of new products Our operations are dependent in part on patents and other intellectual property assets Many of our businesses rely on patent trademark and other intellectual property assets These intellectual property assets in the aggregate are of material importance to our business We can lose the protection afforded by these intellectual property assets through patent expirations legal challenges or governmental action Patents attained by competitors particularly as patents on our products expire may also adversely affect our competitive position In addition competitors may seek to invalidate patents on our products or claim that our products infringe upon their intellectual property which could result in a loss of competitive advantage or the payment of significant legal fees damage awards and past or future royalties as well as injunctions against future sales of our products We also operate in countries that do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as in the US which could make it easier for competitors to compete with us in those countries The loss of a significant portion of our portfolio of intellectual property assets may have an adverse effect on our earnings financial condition or cash flows Natural disasters war and other events could adversely affect our future revenues and operating income Natural disasters including pandemics war terrorism labor disruptions and international conflicts and actions taken by the United States and other governments or by our customers or suppliers in response to such events could cause significant economic disruption and political and social instability in the United States and areas outside of the United States in which we operate These events could result in decreased demand for our products adversely affect our manufacturing and distribution capabilities or increase the costs for or cause interruptions in the supply of materials from our suppliers We need to attract and retain key employees to be competitive Our ability to compete effectively depends upon our ability to attract and retain executives and other key employees including people in technical marketing sales and research positions Competition for experienced employees particularly for 9 Table of Contents persons with specialized skills can be intense Our ability to recruit such talent will depend on a number of factors including compensation and benefits work location and work environment If we cannot effectively recruit and retain qualified executives and employees our business could be adversely affected Risks Relating To Our Acquisition of CareFusion The integration process with CareFusion may be more difficult costly or time consuming than expected and the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the merger may not be realized The success of our acquisition of CareFusion including anticipated benefits and cost savings will depend in part on our ability to successfully combine and integrate our business with the business of CareFusion It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees higher than expected costs diversion of management attention and resources the disruption of ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies that adversely affect the combined companys ability to maintain relationships with customers vendors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the merger As part of the integration process we intend to move assets within our combined company to create efficiencies and may seek to opportunistically divest certain assets of the combined company which may change the profile of the combined company and which may not be possible on favorable terms or at all If we experience difficulties with the integration process the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected These integration matters could have an adverse effect on the combined company for an undetermined period going forward In addition the actual cost savings of the merger could be less than anticipated In connection with the CareFusion transactions we incurred and assumed significant additional indebtedness which could adversely affect us including by decreasing our business flexibility We have substantially increased indebtedness following completion of the CareFusion acquisition in comparison to that of BD on a recent historical basis which has increased our interest expense and could have the effect among other things of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions The amount of cash required to pay interest on our increased indebtedness following the merger and thus the demands on our cash resources is greater than the amount of cash flows required to service our indebtedness prior to the acquisition Our increased levels of indebtedness could also reduce funds available for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions funding research and development or future expansion of our business and other general corporate purposes and may create competitive disadvantages for BD relative to other companies with lower debt levels If we do not achieve the expected benefits and cost savings from the transaction or if the financial performance of the combined company does not meet current expectations then our ability to service this indebtedness may be adversely impacted Certain of the indebtedness incurred in connection with the acquisition bears interest at variable interest rates If interest rates increase variable rate debt will create higher debt service requirements which could adversely affect our cash flows In addition our credit ratings affect the cost and availability of future borrowings and accordingly our cost of capital Our ratings reflect each rating organizations opinion of our financial strength operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations Our ratings were downgraded in connection with the indebtedness incurred and assumed in the acquisition of CareFusion and there can be no assurance that we will achieve a particular rating or maintain a particular rating in the future Moreover we may be required to raise substantial additional financing to fund working capital capital expenditures acquisitions or other general corporate requirements Our ability to arrange additional financing or refinancing will depend on among other factors our financial position and performance as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond our control There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing or refinancing on terms acceptable to us or at all The agreements that govern the indebtedness incurred or assumed in connection with the acquisition contain various covenants that impose restrictions on us and certain of our subsidiaries that may affect our ability to operate our businesses The agreements that govern the indebtedness incurred or assumed in connection with the CareFusion transaction contain various affirmative and negative covenants that may subject to certain significant exceptions restrict our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries including CareFusion to among other things have liens on their property transact business with affiliates andor merge or consolidate with any other person or sell or convey certain of our assets to any one person In addition some of the agreements that govern our indebtedness contain financial covenants that will require us to maintain certain financial ratios Our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control Failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could accelerate our repayment obligations 10 Table of Contents Item 1B Unresolved Staff Comments None Item 2 Properties BDs executive offices are located in Franklin
