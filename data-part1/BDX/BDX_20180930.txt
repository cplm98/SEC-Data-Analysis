Supplementary Data which is incorporated herein by reference International Operations BDs products are manufactured and sold worldwide For reporting purposes we organize our operations outside the United States as follows Europe EMA which includes the Commonwealth of Independent States the Middle East and Africa Greater Asia which includes Japan and Asia Pacific Latin America which includes Mexico Central America the Caribbean and South America and Canada The principal products sold by BD outside the United States are hypodermic needles and syringes insulin syringes and pen needles BD Hypak brand prefillable syringe systems infusion therapy products including Alaris infusion pumps pharmacy automation equipment including Pyxis systems devices and services for the treatment of peripheral arterial and venous disease cancer detection and endstage renal disease and maintenance synthetic and resorbable mesh biologic implants and fixation systems to complement innovative techniques for inguinal ventral and other hernia repair procedures medical devices for urine drainage in the acute care hospital and home care settings BD Vacutainer brand blood collection products diagnostic systems and laboratory equipment and products flow cytometry instruments and reagents BD has manufacturing operations outside the United States in Bosnia and Herzegovina Brazil Canada China Dominican Republic France Germany Hungary India Ireland Israel Italy Japan Malaysia Mexico the Netherlands Singapore Spain and the United Kingdom Geographic information with respect to BDs operations is included under the heading Geographic Information in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data and is incorporated herein by reference Foreign economic conditions and exchange rate fluctuations have caused the profitability related to foreign revenues to fluctuate more than the profitability related to domestic revenues BD believes its activities in some countries outside the United States involve greater risk than its domestic business due to the factors cited herein as well as the economic environment local commercial and economic policies and political uncertainties See further discussion of this risk in Item 1A Risk Factors Distribution BDs products are marketed and distributed in the United States and internationally through independent distribution channels and directly to hospitals and other healthcare institutions by BD and independent sales representatives BD uses acute care nonacute care laboratory and drug wholesaler distributors to broadly support our overall disposable product demand from our end user customers in the United States In international markets products are distributed either directly or through distributors with the practice varying by country Order backlog is not material to BDs business inasmuch as orders for BD products generally are received and filled on a current basis except for items temporarily out of stock BDs worldwide sales are not generally seasonal with the exception of certain medical devices in the Medication Delivery Solutions business unit and flu diagnostic products in the Diagnostic Systems business unit which relate to seasonal diseases such 5 Table of Contents as influenza In order to service its customers optimize logistics lower facilities costs and reduce finished goods inventory levels BD operates consolidated distribution facilities in both the United States and Europe Orders are normally shipped within a matter of days after receipt Raw Materials and Components BD purchases many different types of raw materials and components including plastics glass metals textiles paper products agricultural products electronic and mechanical subassemblies and various biological chemical and petrochemical products BD seeks to ensure continuity of supply by securing multiple options for sourcing However there are situations where raw materials and components are only available from one supplier which are referred to as sole sourced The use of sole sourced materials and components may be due to sourcing of proprietary andor patented technology and processes that are intended to provide a unique market differentiation to our product In other cases while a raw material or component can be sourced from multiple manufacturers only one supplier is qualified due to quality assurance cost or other considerations In order to provide alternate sources BD must complete a rigorous qualification process which most often includes completion of regulatory registration and approval If clinical trials are not required this qualification process can take 318 months depending on the criticality of the change When clinical trials are required this process may lengthen the qualification phase from one to three years BD continuously assesses its sole sourced raw materials and components and maintains business continuity plans with its suppliers BDs continuity plans may include securing secondary supply with alternate suppliers qualification of alternate manufacturing facilities maintaining contingency stock internal development of supply and establishment of technology escrow accounts While BD works closely with its suppliers no assurance can be given that these efforts will be successful and there may be events that cause supply interruption reduction or termination that adversely impacts BDs ability to manufacture and sell certain products Research and Development BD conducts its research and development RD activities at its operating units and at BD Technologies in Research Triangle Park North Carolina The majority of BDs RD activities are conducted in North America Outside North America BD primarily conducts RD activities in China France India Ireland and Singapore BD also collaborates with certain universities medical centers and other entities on RD programs and retains individual consultants and partners to support its efforts in specialized fields BD spent approximately 1006 million 774 million and 828 million on research and development during the fiscal years ended September 30 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively Intellectual Property and Licenses BD owns significant intellectual property including patents patent applications technology trade secrets knowhow copyrights and trademarks in the United States and other countries BD is also licensed under domestic and foreign patents patent applications technology trade secrets knowhow copyrights and trademarks owned by others In the aggregate these intellectual property assets and licenses are of material importance to BDs business BD believes however that no single patent technology trademark intellectual property asset or license is material in relation to BDs business as a whole or to any business segment Competition BD operates in the increasingly complex and challenging medical technology marketplace Technological advances and scientific discoveries have accelerated the pace of change in medical technology the regulatory environment of medical products is becoming more complex and vigorous and economic conditions have resulted in a challenging market Companies of varying sizes compete in the global medical technology field Some are more specialized than BD with respect to particular markets and some have greater financial resources than BD New companies have entered the field particularly in the areas of molecular diagnostics safetyengineered devices and in the life sciences and established companies have diversified their business activities into the medical technology area Other firms engaged in the distribution of medical technology products have become manufacturers of medical devices and instruments as well Acquisitions and collaborations by and among companies seeking a competitive advantage also affect the competitive 6 Table of Contents environment In addition the entry into the market of lowcost manufacturers are creating increased pricing pressures Some competitors have also established manufacturing sites or have contracted with suppliers located in these countries as a means to lower their costs BD competes in this evolving marketplace on the basis of many factors including price quality innovation service reputation distribution and promotion The impact of these factors on BDs competitive position varies among BDs various product offerings In order to remain competitive in the industries in which it operates BD continues to make investments in research and development quality management quality improvement product innovation and productivity improvement in support of its core strategies ThirdParty Reimbursement Reimbursement remains an important strategic consideration in the development and marketing of medical devices and procedures Difficulty in obtaining coverage coding and payment can be a significant barrier to the commercial success of a new product or procedure The consequences can include slow adoption in the marketplace and inadequate payment levels that can continue for months or even years A majority of BDs customers rely on thirdparty payers including government programs and private health insurance plans to reimburse some or all of the cost of the procedures products and services they provide These payers in the United States and abroad are increasingly focused on strategies to control spending on healthcare and reward improvements in quality and patient outcomes BD is actively engaged in identifying and communicating value propositions of its products for payer provider and patient stakeholders and it employs various efforts and resources to attempt to positively impact coverage coding and payment pathways However BD has no direct control over payer decisionmaking with respect to coverage and payment levels for BD products The manner and level of reimbursement in any given case may depend on the site of care the procedures performed the final patient diagnosis the devices andor drugs utilized the available budget or a combination of these factors and coverage and payment levels are determined at each payers discretion As BDs product offerings are diverse across a variety of healthcare settings they are affected to varying degrees by the many payment pathways that impact the decisions of healthcare providers regarding which medical products they purchase and the prices they are willing to pay for those products Therefore changes in reimbursement levels or methods may either positively or negatively impact sales of BD products in any given country for any given product As government programs seek to expand healthcare coverage for their citizens they have at the same time sought to control costs by limiting the amount of reimbursement they will pay for particular procedures products or services Many thirdparty payers have developed specific payment and delivery mechanisms to support these cost control efforts and to focus on paying for value These mechanisms include payment reductions pay for performance measures qualitybased performance payments restrictive coverage policies bidding and tender mechanics studies to compare the effectiveness of therapies and use of technology assessments These changes whether the result of legislation new strategic alliances or market consolidations have created an increased emphasis on the delivery of more costeffective and qualitydriven healthcare For example as a result of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act PPACA the US is implementing value based payment methodologies and seeking to create alternative payment models such as bundled payments to continue to drive improved value We see other governments around the world considering similar bundling reform measures including the development of the Diagnosis Related Group DRG as a payment mechanism to drive toward quality and resource based reimbursement 7 Table of Contents Regulation General BDs medical technology products and operations are subject to regulation by the US Food and Drug Administration FDA and various other federal and state agencies as well as by foreign governmental agencies These agencies enforce laws and regulations that govern the development testing manufacturing labeling advertising marketing and distribution and market surveillance of BDs medical products The scope of the activities of these agencies particularly in the Europe Japan and Asia Pacific regions in which BD operates has been increasing BD actively maintains FDAISO Quality Systems that establish standards for its product design manufacturing and distribution processes Prior to marketing or selling most of its products BD must secure approval from the FDA and counterpart nonUS regulatory agencies Following the introduction of a product these agencies engage in periodic reviews and inspections of BDs quality systems as well as product performance and advertising and promotional materials These regulatory controls as well as any changes in FDA policies can affect the time and cost associated with the development introduction and continued availability of new products Where possible BD anticipates these factors in its product development and planning processes These agencies possess the authority to take various administrative and legal actions against BD such as product recalls product seizures and other civil and criminal sanctions BD also undertakes voluntary compliance actions such as voluntary recalls BD also is subject to various federal and state laws and laws outside the United States concerning healthcare fraud and abuse including false claims laws and antikickback laws global anticorruption transportation safety and health and customs and exports Many of the agencies enforcing these laws have increased their enforcement activities with respect to medical device manufacturers in recent years This appears to be part of a general trend toward increased regulation and enforcement activity within and outside the United States In addition as part of PPACA the federal government has enacted the Sunshine Act provisions requiring BD to publicly report gifts and payments made to physicians and teaching hospitals Failure to comply with these provisions could result in a range of fines penalties andor other sanctions Consent Decree Our infusion pump organizational unit is operating under an amended consent decree entered into by CareFusion with the FDA in 2007 CareFusions consent decree with the FDA related to its Alaris SE infusion pumps In February 2009 CareFusion and the FDA amended the consent decree to include all infusion pumps manufactured by or for CareFusion 303 Inc the organizational unit that manufactures and sells infusion pumps in the United States The amended consent decree does not apply to intravenous administration sets and accessories While this BD organizational unit remains subject to the amended consent decree which includes the requirements of the original consent decree it has made substantial progress in its compliance efforts However we cannot predict the outcome of this matter and the amended consent decree authorizes the FDA in the event of any violations in the future to order us to cease manufacturing and distributing infusion pumps recall products and take other actions We may be required to pay damages of 15000 per day per violation if we fail to comply with any provision of the amended consent decree up to 15 million per year We also cannot currently predict whether additional monetary investment will be incurred to resolve this matter or the matters ultimate impact on our business We may be obligated to pay more costs in the future because among other things the FDA may determine that we are not fully compliant with the amended consent decree and therefore impose penalties under the amended consent decree andor we may be subject to future proceedings and litigation relating to the matters addressed in the amended consent decree As of September 30 2018 we do not believe that a loss is probable in connection with the amended consent decree and accordingly we have no accruals associated with compliance with the amended consent decree 8 Table of Contents FDA Warning Letters In May 2017 the FDA conducted inspections at BDs Preanalytical Systems PAS facility in Franklin Lakes New Jersey In July 2017 the FDA issued a Form 483 to BD PAS in connection with these inspections that contained observations of nonconformance relating to quality system regulations and medical device reporting relating to certain of our BD Vacutainer EDTA blood collection tubes On January 11 2018 BD received a Warning Letter from the FDA citing certain alleged violations of quality system regulations and of law The Warning Letter states that until BD resolves the outstanding issues covered by the Warning Letter the FDA will not clear or approve any premarket submissions for Class III devices to which the nonconformances are reasonably related or grant requests for certificates to foreign governments We submitted our response to the Warning Letter on January 31 2018 The FDA conducted an inspection of BDs facility located in Franklin Wisconsin BD Franklin site from May 16 2018 through August 1 2018 On August 1 2018 the FDA issued a Form 483 to the BD Franklin site in connection with these inspections that contained observations of nonconformance relating to quality system regulations relating to certain prefilled Heparin lock flush syringes and prefilled 09 sodium chloride lock flush syringes On September 14 2018 BD received a Warning Letter from the FDA citing certain alleged violations of quality system regulations and of law In the Warning Letter FDA stated that BDs response appears to be adequate but that several of the actions are still in progress and a followup inspection by FDA of the site will be necessary to verify compliance We submitted our response to the Warning Letter on October 1 2018 BD is working closely with the FDA and intends to fully implement corrective actions to address the concerns identified in the Warning Letters However BD cannot give any assurances that the FDA will be satisfied with its responses to the Warning Letters or as to the expected date of resolution of matters included in the Warning Letters While BD does not believe that the issues identified in the Warning Letters will have a material impact on BDs operation no assurances can be given that the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on BDs business results of operations financial conditions andor liquidity For further discussion of risks relating to the regulations to which we are subject see Item 1A Risk Factors Employees As of September 30 2018 BD had 76032 employees of which 28734 were employed in the US including Puerto Rico BD believes that its employee relations are satisfactory Available Information BD maintains a website at wwwbdcom BD also makes

and webcasts Our website and the information contained therein or connected thereto shall not be deemed to be incorporated into this Annual Report ForwardLooking Statements BD and its representatives may from timetotime make certain forwardlooking statements in publiclyreleased materials both written and oral including statements contained in filings with the SEC and in its reports to shareholders Additional information regarding BDs forwardlooking statements is contained in Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Item 1A Risk Factors An investment in BD involves a variety of risks and uncertainties The following describes some of the significant risks that could adversely affect BDs business financial condition operating results or cash flows Risks Relating to BD A downturn in global economic conditions could adversely affect our operations Deterioration in the global economic environment particularly in emerging markets and countries with governmentsponsored healthcare systems may cause decreased demand for our products and services and increased competition which could result in lower sales volume and downward pressure on the prices for our products longer sales cycles and slower adoption of new technologies A weakening of macroeconomic conditions may also adversely affect our suppliers which could result in interruptions in supply We have previously experienced delays in collecting government receivables in certain countries in Western Europe due to economic conditions and we may experience similar delays in the future in these and other countries or regions experiencing financial problems The medical technology industry is very competitive We are a global company that faces significant competition from a wide range of companies These include large medical device companies with multiple product lines some of which may have greater financial and marketing resources than we do and firms that are more specialized than we are with respect to particular markets or product lines Nontraditional entrants such as technology companies are also entering into the healthcare industry some of which may have greater financial and marketing resources than we do We face competition across all our product lines and in each market in which our products are sold on the basis of product features clinical or economic outcomes product quality availability price services and other factors In addition we face changing customer preferences and requirements including increased customer demand for more environmentallyfriendly products as well as changes in the ways health care services are delivered including the transition of more care to nonacute settings The medical technology industry is also subject to rapid technological change and discovery and frequent product introductions The development of new or improved products processes or technologies by other companies such as needlefree injection technology that provide better features pricing or clinical outcomes or economic value may render our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive In some instances competitors including pharmaceutical companies also offer or are attempting to develop alternative therapies for disease states that may be delivered without a medical device The entry into the market of manufacturers located in China and other lowcost manufacturing locations has also created pricing pressure particularly in developing markets The medical technology industry has also experienced a significant amount of consolidation resulting in companies with greater market presence Health care systems and other health care companies are also consolidating resulting in greater purchasing power for these companies As a result competition among medical device suppliers to provide goods and services has increased Group purchasing organizations and integrated health delivery networks have also served to concentrate purchasing decisions for some customers which has led to downward pricing pressure for medical device suppliers Further consolidation in the industry 10 Table of Contents could intensify competition among medical device suppliers and exert additional pressure on the prices of our products We are subject to foreign currency exchange risk A substantial amount of our revenues are derived from international operations and we anticipate that a significant portion of our sales will continue to come from outside the US in the future The revenues we report with respect to our operations outside the United States may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates A discussion of the financial impact of exchange rate fluctuations and the ways and extent to which we may attempt to address any impact is contained in Item 7 Managements Discussion of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Any hedging activities we engage in may only offset a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates We cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the degree to which we can mitigate these risks Changes in reimbursement practices of thirdparty payers could affect the demand for our products and the prices at which they are sold Our sales depend in part on the extent to which healthcare providers and facilities are reimbursed by government authorities private insurers and other thirdparty payers for the costs of our products including Medicare Medicaid and comparable foreign programs as well as private payors The coverage policies and reimbursement levels of thirdparty payers which can vary among public and private sources and by country may affect which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay for those products in a particular jurisdiction Reimbursement rates can also affect the acceptance rate of new technologies and products Legislative or administrative reforms to reimbursement systems in the United States or abroad changes in coverage or reimbursement rates by private payers or adverse decisions relating to our products by administrators of these systems could significantly reduce reimbursement for procedures using our products or result in denial of reimbursement for those products which would adversely affect customer demand or the price customers are willing to pay for such products See ThirdParty Reimbursement under Item 1 Business The reinstatement of the PPACAs medical device tax may adversely affect our results of operations The PPACA imposes on medical device manufacturers such as BD a 23 excise tax on US sales of certain medical devices While the excise tax has been suspended until the end of 2019 absent further legislative action it will be reinstated in 2020 which would adversely affect our results of operation Cost volatility could adversely affect our operations Our results of operations could be negatively impacted by volatility in the cost of raw materials components freight and energy that increases the costs of producing and distributing our products New laws or regulations adopted in response to climate change could also increase energy costs as well as the costs of certain raw materials and components In particular we purchase supplies of resins which are oilbased components used in the manufacture of certain products and any significant increases in resin costs could adversely impact future operating results Increases in oil prices can also increase our packaging and transportation costs We may not be able to offset any increases in these operational costs Breaches of our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our operations We rely on information technology systems to process transmit and store electronic information in our daytoday operations including sensitive personal information and proprietary or confidential information In addition some of our products include information technology that collects data regarding patients and patient therapy on behalf of our customers and some connect to our systems for maintenance purposes Our information technology systems have been subjected to attack via malicious code execution and cyber or phishing attacks and we have experienced instances of unauthorized access to our systems in the past and expect to be subject to similar attacks in the future In addition to our own information in the course of doing business we sometimes store information with third parties that could be subject to these types of attacks 11 Table of Contents Cyberattacks could result in our intellectual property and other confidential information being accessed or stolen Likewise we could suffer disruption of our operations and other significant negative consequences including increased costs for security measures or remediation diversion of management attention and adverse impact on our relationships with vendors business partners and customers Unauthorized tampering adulteration or interference with our products may also create issues with product functionality that could result in a loss of data risk to patient safety and product recalls or field actions Cyberattacks could result in unauthorized access to our systems and products which could also result in actions by regulatory bodies or civil litigation While we will continue to dedicate significant resources to protect against unauthorized access to our systems and work with government authorities to detect and reduce the risk of future cyber incidents cyberattacks are becoming more sophisticated frequent and adaptive There can be no assurances that our protective measures will prevent future attacks that could have a material adverse impact on our business Our future growth is dependent in part upon the development of new products and there can be no assurance that such products will be developed A significant element of our strategy is to increase revenue growth by focusing on innovation and new product development New product development requires significant investment in research and development clinical trials and regulatory approvals The results of our product development efforts may be affected by a number of factors including our ability to anticipate customer needs innovate and develop new products and technologies successfully complete clinical trials obtain regulatory approvals and reimbursement in the United States and abroad manufacture products in a costeffective manner obtain appropriate intellectual property protection for our products and gain and maintain market acceptance of our products In addition patents attained by others can preclude or delay our commercialization of a product There can be no assurance that any products now in development or that we may seek to develop in the future will achieve technological feasibility obtain regulatory approval or gain market acceptance We cannot guarantee that any of our strategic acquisitions investments or alliances will be successful We may seek to supplement our internal growth through strategic acquisitions investments and alliances Such transactions are inherently risky and the integration of any newlyacquired business requires significant effort and management attention The success of any acquisition investment or alliance may be affected by a number of factors including our ability to properly assess and value the potential business opportunity or to successfully integrate any business we may acquire into our existing business There can be no assurance that any past or future transaction will be successful The international operations of our business may subject us to certain business risks A substantial amount of our sales come from our operations outside the United States and we intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in foreign markets especially in emerging markets Our foreign operations subject us to certain risks including among others the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange discussed above the effects of local economic and political conditions competition from local companies trade protectionism and restrictions on the transfer of capital across borders US relations with the governments of the foreign countries in which we operate foreign regulatory requirements or changes in such requirements local product preferences and product requirements longer payment terms for account receivables than we experience in the US difficulty in establishing staffing and managing foreign operations changes to international trade agreements and treaties changes in tax laws weakening or loss of the protection of intellectual property rights in some countries and import or export licensing requirements The success of our operations outside the United States also depends in part on our ability to make necessary infrastructure enhancements to among other things our production facilities and sales and distribution networks In addition our international operations are governed by the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anticorruption laws outside the US Global enforcement of anticorruption laws has increased substantially in recent years with more enforcement proceedings by US and foreign governmental agencies and the imposition of significant fines and penalties While we have implemented policies and procedures to enhance compliance with these laws our international operations which often involve customer relationships with foreign 12 Table of Contents governments create the risk that there may be unauthorized payments or offers of payments made by employees consultants sales agents or distributors Any alleged or actual violations of these laws may subject us to government investigations significant criminal or civil sanctions and other liabilities and negatively affect our reputation Changes in US policy regarding international trade including import and export regulation and international trade agreements could also negatively impact our business In 2018 the US imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum as well as on goods imported from China and certain other countries which has resulted in retaliatory tariffs by China and other countries Additional tariffs imposed by the US on a broader range of imports or further retaliatory trade measures taken by China or other countries in response could result in an increase in supply chain costs that we may not be able to offset or otherwise adversely impact our results of operations The June 2016 referendum result in the United Kingdom UK to exit the European Union EU commonly known as Brexit and the subsequent commencement of the official withdrawal process by the UK government in March 2017 has created uncertainties affecting business operations in the UK and the EU Until the terms of the UKs exit from the EU in March 2019 are determined including any transition period it is difficult to predict its impact It is possible that the withdrawal could among other things affect the legal and regulatory environments to which our businesses are subject impact trade between the UK and the EU and other parties and create economic and political uncertainty in the region Reductions in customers research budgets or government funding may adversely affect our business We sell products to researchers at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies academic institutions government laboratories and private foundations Research and development spending of our customers can fluctuate based on spending priorities and general economic conditions A number of these customers are also dependent for their funding upon grants from US government agencies such as the US National Institutes of Health NIH and agencies in other countries The level of government funding of research and development is unpredictable For instance there have been instances where NIH grants have been frozen or otherwise unavailable for extended periods The availability of governmental research funding may be adversely affected by economic conditions and governmental spending reductions Any reduction or delay in governmental funding could cause our customers to delay or forego purchases of our products A reduction or interruption in the supply of certain raw materials and components would adversely affect our manufacturing operations and related product sales We purchase many different types of raw materials and components used in our products Certain raw materials and components are not available from multiple sources In addition for quality assurance costeffectiveness and other reasons certain raw materials and components are purchased from sole suppliers The price and supply of these materials and components may be impacted or disrupted for reasons beyond our control While we work with suppliers to ensure continuity of supply no assurance can be given that these efforts will be successful In addition due to regulatory requirements relating to the qualification of suppliers we may not be able to establish additional or replacement sources on a timely basis or without excessive cost The termination reduction or interruption in supply of these raw materials and components could adversely impact our ability to manufacture and sell certain of our products Interruption of our manufacturing operations could adversely affect our future revenues and operating income We have manufacturing sites all over the world In some instances however the manufacturing of certain of our product lines is concentrated in one or more of our plants Damage to one or more of these facilities from weather or natural disasters or issues in our manufacturing process equipment failure or other factors could adversely affect our ability to manufacture these products resulting in lost revenues and damage to our relationships with customers 13 Table of Contents We are subject to lawsuits We are or have been a defendant in a number of lawsuits including purported class action lawsuits for alleged antitrust violations product liability claims which may involve lawsuits seeking class action status or seeking to establish multidistrict litigation proceedings including claims relating to our hernia repair implant products surgical continence and pelvic organ prolapse products for women and vena cava filter products and suits alleging patent infringement We have also been subject to government subpoenas seeking information with respect to alleged violations of law including in connection with federal andor state healthcare programs such as Medicare or Medicaid andor sales and marketing practices such as the civil investigative demands received by BD and Bard A more detailed description of the foregoing is contained in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data We could be subject to additional lawsuits or governmental investigations in the future Reserves established for estimated losses with respect to legal proceedings do not represent an exact calculation of our actual liability but instead represent our estimate of the probable loss at the time the reserve is established Due to the inherent uncertainty of litigation and our underlying loss reserve estimates additional reserves may be established from timetotime Also in some instances we are not able to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the litigation to which we are a party In view of these uncertainties we could incur charges materially in excess of any currently established accruals and to the extent available excess liability insurance Any such future charges individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition andor liquidity With respect to our existing product liability litigation we believe that some settlements and judgments as well as legal defense costs may be covered in whole or in part under our product liability insurance policies with a limited number of insurance companies or in some circumstances indemnification obligations to us from other parties However amounts recovered under these arrangements may be less than the stated coverage limits or less than otherwise expected and may not be adequate to cover damages andor costs In addition there is no guarantee that insurers or other parties will pay claims or that coverage or indemnity will be otherwise available For certain product liability claims or lawsuits the Company does not maintain or has limited remaining insurance coverage and we may not be able to obtain additional insurance on acceptable terms or at all that will provide adequate protection against potential liabilities We are subject to extensive regulation Our operations are global and are affected by complex state federal and international laws relating to healthcare environmental protection antitrust anticorruption marketing fraud and abuse including antikickback and false claims laws export control employment privacy and other areas Violations of these laws can result in criminal or civil sanctions including substantial fines and in some cases exclusion from participation in health care programs such as Medicare and Medicaid Environmental laws particularly with respect to the emission of greenhouse gases are also becoming more stringent throughout the world which may increase our costs of operations or necessitate changes in our manufacturing plants or processes or those of our suppliers or result in liability to BD The enactment of additional laws in the future may increase our compliance costs or otherwise adversely impact our operations We are also subject to extensive regulation by the FDA pursuant to the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act by comparable agencies in foreign countries and by other regulatory agencies and governing bodies Most of our products must receive clearance or approval from the FDA or counterpart regulatory agencies in other countries before they can be marketed or sold The process for obtaining marketing approval or clearance may take a significant period of time and require the expenditure of substantial resources and these have been increasing due to increased requirements from the FDA for supporting data for submissions The process may also require changes to our products or result in limitations on the indicated uses of the products Governmental agencies may also impose new requirements regarding registration labeling or prohibited materials that may require us to modify or reregister products already on the market or otherwise impact our ability to market our products in those countries Once clearance or approval has been obtained for a product there is an obligation to ensure that all applicable FDA and other regulatory requirements continue to be met Following the introduction of a product these agencies also periodically review our manufacturing processes and product performance Our failure to comply with the applicable good manufacturing practices adverse event reporting clinical trial and other requirements of these agencies could delay or prevent the production marketing or sale of our 14 Table of Contents products and result in fines delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances closure of manufacturing sites seizures or recalls of products and damage to our reputation More stringent oversight by the FDA and other agencies in recent years has resulted in increased enforcement activity which increases the compliance risk for us and other companies in our industry As a result of the CareFusion acquisition we are operating under a consent decree with the FDA that was entered into by CareFusion in 2009 that affects our infusion pump business in the United States We are also currently operating under two warning letters issued by the FDA For more information regarding the consent decree and warning letters see Regulation under Item 1 Business In addition the European Union EU has adopted the EU Medical Device Regulation the EU MDR and the In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation the EU IVDR each of which impose stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of medical devices including in the area of clinical evaluation requirements quality systems and postmarket surveillance Manufacturers of currently approved medical devices will have until May 2020 to meet the requirements of the EU MDR and until May 2022 to meet the EU IVDR Complying with the requirements of these regulations will require us to incur significant expenditures Failure to meet these requirements could adversely impact our business in the EU and other regions that tie their product registrations to the EU requirements We are also subject to laws in the US and elsewhere regarding privacy and the protection of personal information For instance the EU has also adopted the General Data Protection Regulation GDPR which will apply to personal data involved in our operations in the EU or products and services that we offer to EU users involving personal data The GDPR creates a range of new compliance obligations that could require us to change our existing business practices policies and significantly increases financial penalties for noncompliance Defects or quality issues associated with our products could adversely affect the results of our operations The design manufacture and marketing of medical devices involve certain inherent risks Manufacturing or design defects component failures unapproved or improper use of our products or inadequate disclosure of risks or other information relating to the use of our products can lead to injury or other serious adverse events These events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products either voluntary or as required by the FDA or similar governmental authorities in other countries and could result in certain cases in the removal of a product from the market A recall could result in significant costs and lost sales and customers enforcement actions andor investigations by state and federal governments or other enforcement bodies as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce future demand for our products Personal injuries relating to the use of our products can also result in significant product liability claims being brought against us In some circumstances such adverse events could also cause delays in regulatory approval of new products or the imposition of postmarket approval requirements Our operations are dependent in part on patents and other intellectual property assets Many of our businesses rely on patent trademark and other intellectual property assets These intellectual property assets in the aggregate are of material importance to our business We can lose the protection afforded by these intellectual property assets through patent expirations legal challenges or governmental action Patents attained by competitors particularly as patents on our products expire may also adversely affect our competitive position In addition competitors may seek to invalidate patents on our products or claim that our products infringe upon their intellectual property which could result in a loss of competitive advantage or the payment of significant legal fees damage awards and past or future royalties as well as injunctions against future sales of our products We also operate in countries that do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as in the US which could make it easier for competitors to compete with us in those countries The loss of a significant portion of our portfolio of intellectual property assets may have an adverse effect on our earnings financial condition or cash flows 15 Table of Contents Natural disasters war and other events could adversely affect our future revenues and operating income Natural disasters including pandemics war terrorism labor disruptions and international conflicts and actions taken by the United States and other governments or by our customers or suppliers in response to such events could cause significant economic disruption and political and social instability in the United States and areas outside of the United States in which we operate These events could result in decreased demand for our products adversely affect our manufacturing and distribution capabilities or increase the costs for or cause interruptions in the supply of materials from our suppliers We need to attract and retain key employees to be competitive Our ability to compete effectively depends upon our ability to attract and retain executives and other key employees including people in technical marketing sales and research positions Competition for experienced employees particularly for persons with specialized skills can be intense Our ability to recruit such talent will depend on a number of factors including compensation and benefits work location and work environment If we cannot effectively recruit and retain qualified executives and employees our business could be adversely affected Risks Relating To Our Acquisition of Bard The integration of the Bard business may be more difficult costly or time consuming than expected and the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the Bard acquisition may not be realized The success of the Bard acquisition including anticipated benefits and cost savings will depend in part on our ability to successfully combine and integrate our legacy business with the business of Bard The integration of Bards business with our existing business is a complex costly and timeconsuming process It is possible that a number of factors including without limitation the loss of key employees higher than expected costs diversion of management attention and resources the disruption of ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers vendors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the acquisition If we experience difficulties with the integration process the anticipated benefits of the Bard acquisition may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected These integration matters could have an adverse effect on us for an undetermined period following the acquisition In addition the actual cost savings of the Bard acquisition could be less than anticipated The future results of the combined company may be adversely impacted if we do not effectively manage our expanded operations Following the completion of the Bard acquisition the size of our business has increased significantly Our ability to successfully manage this expanded business will depend in part upon managements ability to design and implement strategic initiatives that address not only the integration of the two companies but also the increased scale and scope of the combined business with its associated increased costs and complexity There can be no assurances that we will be successful or that we will realize the expected operating efficiencies cost savings and other benefits currently anticipated from the Bard acquisition We will incur substantial expenses related to the integration of Bard We incurred and expect to continue to incur a number of nonrecurring costs associated with the Bard integration related to formulating and implementing integration plans including facilities and systems consolidation costs and employmentrelated costs We continue to assess the magnitude of these costs and additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the Bard integration Although we expect that the elimination of duplicative costs as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses should allow us to offset integrationrelated costs over time this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term or at all 16 Table of Contents In connection with the Bard acquisition we incurred significant additional indebtedness which could adversely affect us including by decreasing our business flexibility and will increase our interest expense We have substantially increased our indebtedness in connection with the Bard acquisition through the incurrence of new indebtedness to finance the acquisition and the assumption of Bards existing indebtedness in comparison to our indebtedness on a recent historical basis This could have the effect of among other things reducing our flexibility to respond to business challenges and opportunities and increasing our interest expense The amount of cash required to pay interest on our increased indebtedness levels following completion of the Bard acquisition and thus the demands on our cash resources are greater than the amount of cash flows required to service our indebtedness prior to the Bard acquisition The increased levels of indebtedness following completion of the Bard acquisition may also reduce funds available for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions the repayment or refinancing of our indebtedness as it becomes due and other general corporate purposes and may create competitive disadvantages for us relative to other companies with lower debt levels In addition certain of the indebtedness incurred in connection with the Bard acquisition bears interest at variable interest rates If interest rates increase variable rate debt will create higher debt service requirements which could further adversely affect our cash flows If we do not achieve the expected benefits and cost savings from the Bard acquisition or if the financial performance as a combined company does not meet current expectations then our ability to service our indebtedness may be adversely impacted In addition our credit ratings affect the cost and availability of future borrowings and accordingly our cost of capital Our ratings reflect each rating organizations opinion of our financial strength operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations There can be no assurance that we will achieve a particular rating or maintain a particular rating in the future or that we will be able to maintain our current rating Furthermore our combined companys credit ratings were lowered following the Bard acquisition including below investment grade by Moodys Investors Service Inc which may further increase our future borrowing costs and reduce our access to capital Moreover in the future we may be required to raise substantial additional financing to fund working capital capital expenditures the repayment or refinancing of our indebtedness acquisitions or other general corporate requirements Our ability to arrange additional financing or refinancing will depend on among other factors our financial position and performance as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond our control No assurance can be provided that we will be able to obtain additional financing or refinancing on terms acceptable to us or at all We may not be able to service all of our indebtedness We depend on cash on hand and cash flows from operations to make scheduled debt payments However our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations of the combined company and to utilize other methods to make scheduled payments will depend on a range of economic competitive and business factors many of which are outside of our control There can be no assurance that these sources will be adequate If we are unable to service our indebtedness and fund our operations we will be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures seek additional capital sell assets or refinance our indebtedness Any such action may not be successful and we may be unable to service our indebtedness and fund our operations which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations The agreements that govern the indebtedness incurred in connection with the Bard acquisition impose restrictions that may affect our ability to operate our businesses The agreements that govern the indebtedness incurred in connection with the Bard acquisition contain various affirmative and negative covenants that may subject to certain significant exceptions restrict the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to incur debt and the ability of us and certain of our subsidiaries to among other things have liens on our property andor merge or consolidate with any other person or sell or convey certain of our assets to any one person engage in certain transactions with affiliates and change the nature of our business In addition the agreements also require us to comply with certain financial covenants including financial ratios Our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control Failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could accelerate our repayment obligations and could result in a default and acceleration under other 17 Table of Contents agreements containing crossdefault provisions Under these circumstances we might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations The mandatory convertible preferred stock underlying the depositary shares issued in connection with the financing of the Bard transaction may adversely affect the market price of BD common stock The market price of BD common stock is likely to be influenced by the mandatory convertible preferred stock underlying the depositary shares issued in connection with the financing for the Bard transaction The market price of BD common stock could become more volatile and could be depressed by  investors anticipation of the potential resale in the market of a substantial number of additional shares of BD common stock received upon conversion of the mandatory convertible preferred stock  possible sales of BD common stock by investors who view the mandatory convertible preferred stock as a more attractive means of equity participation in BD than owning shares of BD common stock and  hedging or arbitrage trading activity that may develop involving the mandatory convertible preferred stock and BD common stock Item 1B Unresolved Staff Comments None Item 2
