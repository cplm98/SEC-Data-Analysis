PART I ITEM 1 BUSINESS GENERAL Overview and Description of Major Subsidiaries AEP was incorporated under the laws of the State of New York in 1906 and reorganized in 1925 It is a public utility holding company that owns directly or indirectly all of the outstanding common stock of its public utility subsidiaries and varying percentages of other subsidiaries The service areas of AEPs public utility subsidiaries cover portions of the states of Arkansas Indiana Kentucky Louisiana Michigan Ohio Oklahoma Tennessee Texas Virginia and West Virginia Transmission networks are interconnected with extensive distribution facilities in the territories served The public utility subsidiaries of AEP have traditionally provided electric service consisting of generation transmission and distribution on an integrated basis to their retail customers Restructuring laws in Michigan Ohio and the ERCOT area of Texas have caused AEP public utility subsidiaries in those states to unbundle previously integrated regulated rates for their retail customers The member companies of the AEP System have contractual financial and other business relationships with the other member companies such as participation in the AEP System savings and retirement plans and tax returns sales of electricity and transportation and handling of fuel The companies of the AEP System also obtain certain accounting administrative information systems engineering financial legal maintenance and other services at cost from a common provider AEPSC As of December 31 2020 the subsidiaries of AEP had a total of 16787 employees Because it is a holding company rather than an operating company AEP has no employees The material subsidiaries of AEP are as follows AEP Texas Organized in Delaware in 1925 AEP Texas is

generally use shortterm debt to finance working capital needs Shortterm debt may also be used to finance acquisitions construction and redemption or repurchase of outstanding securities until such needs can be financed with longterm debt In recent history shortterm funding needs have been provided for by cash on hand and AEPs commercial paper program Funds are made available to subsidiaries under the AEP corporate borrowing program Certain public utility subsidiaries of AEP also sell accounts receivable to provide liquidity See Financial Condition section of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the 2020 Annual Report for additional information AEPs revolving credit agreement which backstops the commercial paper program includes covenants and events of default typical for this type of facility including a maximum debtcapital test In addition the acceleration of AEPs payment obligations or the obligations of certain of its major subsidiaries prior to maturity under any other agreement or instrument relating to debt outstanding in excess of 50 million would cause an event of default under the credit agreement As of December 31 2020 AEP was in compliance with its debt covenants With the exception of a voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency any event of default has either or both a cure period or notice requirement before termination of the agreement A voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency of AEP or one of its significant subsidiaries would be considered an immediate termination event See Financial Condition section of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the 2020 Annual Report for additional information AEPs subsidiaries have also utilized and expect to continue to utilize additional financing arrangements such as securitization financings and leasing arrangements including the leasing of coal transportation equipment and facilities ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER MATTERS General AEP subsidiaries are currently subject to regulation by federal state and local authorities with regard to air and waterquality control and other environmental matters and are subject to zoning and other regulation by local authorities The environmental issues that management believes are potentially material to the AEP System are outlined below 8 Clean Water Act Requirements Operations for AEP subsidiaries are subject to the CWA which prohibits the discharge of pollutants into waters of the United States except pursuant to appropriate permits and regulates systems that withdraw surface water for use in power plants In 2014 the Federal EPA issued a final rule setting forth standards for water withdrawals at existing power plants that is intended to reduce mortality of aquatic organisms pinned against a plants cooling water intake screen impingement or entrained in the cooling water The standards affect all plants withdrawing more than two million gallons of cooling water per day A schedule for compliance with the standard is established by the permit agency and incorporated in NPDES permits In November 2015 the Federal EPA issued a final rule revising effluent limitation guidelines for electricity generating facilities The rule established limits on FGD wastewater fly ash and bottom ash transport water and flue gas mercury control wastewater to be imposed in NPDES permits as soon as possible after November 2018 and no later than December 2023 The Federal EPA further revised the rule in August 2020 for FGD wastewater and bottom ash transport water extending the compliance date to December 2025 and establishing additional options In January 2020 the Federal EPA issued a final rule revising the scope of the waters of the United States subject to CWA regulation See Environmental Issues  Clean Water Act Regulations section of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the 2020 Annual Report for additional information Coal Ash Regulation AEPs operations produce a number of different coal combustion byproducts including fly ash bottom ash gypsum and other materials A rule by the Federal EPA regulates the disposal and beneficial reuse of coal combustion residuals including fly ash and bottom ash generated at coalfired electric generating units The rule requires certain standards for location groundwater monitoring and dam stability to be met at landfills and certain surface impoundments at operating facilities If existing disposal facilities cannot meet these standards they will be required to close See Environmental Issues  Coal Combustion Residual Rule section of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the 2020 Annual Report for additional information Clean Air Act Requirements The CAA establishes a comprehensive program to protect and improve the nations air quality and control mobile and stationary sources of air emissions The major CAA programs affecting AEPs power plants are described below The states implement and administer many of these programs and could impose additional or more stringent requirements The Acid Rain Program The CAA includes a capandtrade emission reduction program for SO 2 emissions from power plants and requirements for power plants to reduce NO x emissions through the use of available combustion controls collectively called the Acid Rain Program AEP continues to meet its obligations under the Acid Rain Program through the installation of controls use of alternate fuels and participation in the emissions allowance markets National Ambient Air Quality Standards The CAA requires the Federal EPA to review the available scientific data for criteria pollutants periodically and establish a concentration level in the ambient air for those substances that is adequate to protect the public health and welfare with an extra safety margin The Federal EPA also can list additional pollutants and develop concentration levels for them These concentration levels are known as NAAQS 9 Each state identifies the areas within its boundaries that meet the NAAQS attainment areas and those that do not nonattainment areas Each state must develop a SIP to bring nonattainment areas into compliance with the NAAQS and maintain good air quality in attainment areas All SIPs are submitted to the Federal EPA for approval If a state fails to develop adequate plans the Federal EPA develops and implements a plan As the Federal EPA reviews the NAAQS and establishes new concentration levels the attainment status of areas can change and states may be required to develop new SIPs See Environmental Issues  Clean Air Act Requirements section of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the 2020 Annual Report for additional information Hazardous Air Pollutants HAP The CAA also requires the Federal EPA to investigate HAP emissions from the electric utility sector and submit a report to Congress to determine whether those emissions should be regulated In 2011 the Federal EPA issued a rule setting Maximum Achievable Control Technology standards for new and existing coal and oilfired utility units and New Source Performance Standards for emissions from new and modified power plants In 2014 the US Supreme Court determined that the Federal EPA acted unreasonably in refusing to consider costs in determining if it was appropriate and necessary to regulate HAP emissions from electric generating units The Federal EPA has engaged in additional rulemaking activity but the 2011 rule remains in effect See Environmental Issues  Mercury and Other Hazardous Air Pollutants Regulation section of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the 2020 Annual Report for additional information Regional Haze The CAA establishes visibility goals for certain federally designated areas including national parks and requires states to submit SIPs that will demonstrate reasonable progress toward preventing impairment of visibility in these protected areas In 2005 the Federal EPA issued its Clean Air Visibility Rule detailing how the CAAs best available retrofit technology requirements will be applied to facilities built between 1962 and 1977 that emit more than 250 tons per year of certain pollutants in specific industrial categories including power plants PSO executed a settlement with the Federal EPA and the State of Oklahoma to comply with Regional Haze program requirements in Oklahoma and the settlement is now codified in the Oklahoma SIP and approved by the Federal EPA The Federal EPA disapproved portions of the Arkansas and Texas SIPs and finalized FIPs for both states Arkansas submitted and received approval of a revised SIP and the Federal EPA developed a revised FIP for Texas See Environmental Issues  Clean Air Act Requirements section of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the 2020 Annual Report for additional information Climate Change AEP has taken action to reduce and offset CO 2 emissions from its generating fleet and expects CO 2 emissions from its operations to continue to decline due to the retirement of coalfired generation units and actions taken to diversify the generation fleet and increase energy efficiency where there is regulatory support for such activities In 2021 AEP announced revised intermediate and longterm CO 2 emission reduction goals based on the output of the companys integrated resource plans which take into account economics customer demand regulations grid reliability and resiliency and reflect the companys current business strategy The intermediate goal is an 80 reduction from 2000 CO 2 emission levels from AEP generating facilities by 2030 the longterm goal is netzero CO 2 emissions from AEP generating facilities by 2050 AEPs total estimated CO 2 emissions in 2020 were approximately 44 million metric tons a 73 reduction from AEPs 2000 CO 2 emissions AEP will publish a new report in 2021 on the results of a climate change scenario analysis To date the Federal EPA has twice taken action to regulate CO 2 emissions from new and existing fossil fueled electric generating units under the existing provisions of the CAA The Clean Power Plan was adopted in October 2015 but the US Supreme Court issued a stay of its implementation including all of the deadlines for submission 10 of initial or final state plans The Clean Power Plan was repealed by the Federal EPA in 2019 and replaced by the Affordable Clean Energy ACE Rule which changed the Federal EPAs approach to regulating CO 2 emissions from existing coalfired generating units In January 2021 the ACE Rule was vacated by the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and remanded to the Federal EPA for further proceedings It is too soon to predict how the Federal EPA will respond to the courts remand Management expects emissions to continue to decline over time as AEP diversifies generating sources and operates fewer coal units The projected decline in coalfired generation is due to a number of factors including the ongoing cost of operating older units the relative cost of coal and natural gas as fuel sources increasing environmental regulations requiring significant capital investments and changing commodity market fundamentals Transforming AEPs Generation Fleet The electric utility industry is in the midst of an historic transformation driven by changing customer needs policy demands demographics competitive offerings technologies and commodity prices AEP is also transforming to be more agile and customerfocused as a valued provider of energy solutions AEPs longterm commitment to reduce CO 2 emissions reflects the current direction of the companys resource plans to meet those needs as well a new climate change scenario analysis to be published in 2021 AEPs exposure to carbon regulation has been greatly reduced over the last several years From 2000 to 2020 AEPs CO 2 emissions declined 73 In 2020 coal represented 44 of AEPs generating capacity compared with 70 in 2005 Management expects the percentage of AEPs generating resources fueled by coal will continue to decline and to represent only 24 of generating capacity by 2030 The longterm goal is netzero CO 2 emissions from AEP generating facilities by 2050 Transforming AEPs generation portfolio to include where there is regulatory support more renewable energy and focusing on the efficient use of energy demand response distributed resources and technology solutions to more efficiently manage the grid over time is part of this strategy The graph below summarizes AEPs generation capacity by resource type for the years 1999 2005 and 2020 a Energy EfficiencyDemand Response represents avoided capacity rather than physical assets 11 Renewable Sources of Energy The states AEP serves other than Kentucky West Virginia and Tennessee have established mandatory or voluntary programs to increase the use of energy efficiency alternative energy or renewable energy sources As of December 31 2020 AEPs regulated utilities had longterm contracts for 2750 MWs of wind 80 MWs of hydro and 10 MWs of solar power delivering renewable energy to the companies customers In addition IM owns four solar projects that make up IMs 16 MW Clean Energy Solar Pilot Project Management actively manages AEPs compliance position and is on pace to meet the relevant requirements or benchmarks in each applicable jurisdiction In 2020 PSO received approval from the OCC and SWEPCo received approval from the APSC and LPSC to acquire the North Central Wind Energy Facilities comprised of three Oklahoma wind facilities totaling 1485 MWs on a fixed cost turnkey basis at completion Both the APSC and LPSC approved the flexup option agreeing to acquire the Texas portion which the PUCT denied PSO will own 455 and SWEPCo will own 545 of the project which will cost approximately 2 billion In May 2020 the IRS issued a notice extending the Continuity Safe Harbor deadlines for qualifying renewable energy projects that began construction in 2016 and 2017 by one year as many projects are facing supply chain and other project development delays caused by COVID19 Under the May 2020 IRS notice qualifying renewable energy projects that began construction in 2016 and 2017 and which are placed inservice by the end of 2021 and 2022 respectively will satisfy the Continuity Safe Harbor Provided that each facility does satisfy the Continuity Safe Harbor under the current IRS guidance the 199 MW wind facility will qualify for 100 of the federal PTC and the remaining two wind facilities totaling 1286 MWs will qualify for 80 of the federal PTC Having regulatory approval and the expectation that all three wind facilities will be eligible for the IRS extension of the Continuity Safe Harbor PSO and SWEPCo are proceeding with the full 1485 MW development of these three projects The 199 MW wind facility is targeted to be acquired and placed inservice in March 2021 The 287 MW wind facility is targeted to be acquired and placed inservice in December 2021 and the 999 MW wind facility is targeted to be acquired and placed inservice between December 2021 and April 2022 The growth of AEPs renewable generation portfolio reflects the companys strategy to diversify generation resources to provide clean energy options to customers that meet both their energy and capacity needs In addition to gradually reducing AEPs reliance on coalfueled generating units the growth of renewables and natural gas helps AEP to maintain a diversity of generation resources The integrated resource plans filed with state regulatory commissions by AEPs regulated utility subsidiaries reflect AEPs renewable strategy to balance reliability and cost with customers desire for clean energy in a carbonconstrained world AEP has committed significant capital investments to modernize the electric grid and integrate these new resources Transmission assets of the AEP System interconnect approximately 16300 MWs of renewable energy resources AEPs

Wisconsin End Use Energy Efficiency AEP has reduced energy consumption and peak demand through the introduction of additional energy efficiency and demand response programs These programs commonly referred to as demandside management were implemented in jurisdictions where appropriate cost recovery was available AEPs operating companies programs have reduced annual consumption by over 9 million MWhs and peak demand by approximately 2900 MWs since 2008 AEP estimates that its operating companies spent approximately 15 billion during that period to achieve these levels Energy efficiency and demand reduction programs have received regulatory support in most of the states AEP serves Appropriate cost recovery will be essential for AEP operating companies to continue and expand these consumer offerings Appropriate recovery of program costs lost revenues and an opportunity to earn a reasonable return ensures that energy efficiency programs are considered equally with supply side investments As AEP continues to transition to a cleaner more efficient energy future energy efficiency and demand response programs will continue to play an important role in how the company serves its customers AEP believes its experience providing robust energy efficiency programs in several states positions the company to be a costeffective provider of these programs as states develop their implementation plans Corporate Governance In response to environmental issues and in connection with its assessment of AEPs strategic plan the Board of Directors continually reviews the risks posed by new environmental rules and requirements that could accelerate the retirement of coalfired generation assets The Board of Directors is informed of any new environmental regulations and proposed regulation or legislation that would significantly affect AEP The Boards Committee on Directors and Corporate Governance oversees AEPs annual Corporate Accountability Report which includes information about AEPs environmental social governance and financial performance AEP set CO 2 emission reduction goals in 2018 after considering input from corporate governance outreach effort with shareholders In February 2021 AEP announced new intermediate and longterm CO 2 emission reduction goals based on the output of the companys integrated resource plans which take into account economics customer demand grid reliability and resiliency regulations and the companys current business strategy The intermediate goal is an 80 13 reduction from 2000 CO 2 emission levels from AEP generating facilities by 2030 the longterm goal is netzero CO 2 emissions from AEP generating facilities by 2050 AEP has made significant progress in reducing CO 2 emissions from its power generation fleet and expects its emissions to continue to decline Technological advances including advanced energy storage modular nuclear and green hydrogen and public policies are among the factors that will determine how quickly AEP can achieve netzero emissions while continuing to provide reliable affordable power for customers AEP will publish a new report in 2021 on the results of a climate change scenario analysis Other Environmental Issues and Matters The Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 imposes costs for environmental remediation upon owners and previous owners of sites as well as transporters and generators of hazardous material disposed of at such sites See The Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act Superfund and State Remediation section of Note 6 included in the 2020 Annual Report for additional information Environmental Investments Investments related to improving AEP System plants environmental performance and compliance with air and water quality standards during 2018 2019 and 2020 and the current estimate for 2021 are shown below These investments include both environmental as well as other related spending Estimated construction expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints environmental regulations business opportunities market volatility economic trends and the ability to access capital In addition to the amounts set forth below AEP expects to make substantial investments in future years in connection with the modification and addition at generation plants facilities for environmental quality controls Such future investments are needed in order to comply with air and water quality standards that have been adopted and have deadlines for compliance after 2020 or have been proposed and may be adopted Future investments could be significantly greater if emissions reduction requirements are accelerated or otherwise become more stringent The cost of complying with applicable environmental laws regulations and rules is expected to be material to the AEP System AEP typically recovers costs of complying with environmental standards from customers through rates in regulated jurisdictions Failure to recover these costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm AEPs financial condition

condition than when they came to work Zero Harm is what we value most and commit to wholeheartedly It is hard work as it requires full focus every moment of every day We hold ourselves accountable and we are always striving to be better For AEP Zero Harm is not an option it is a mandate we live by AEP has put tools training and processes in place to strengthen our safetyfirst culture and mindset AEPs focus is on learning from events and developing leading indicators to be even more proactive in preventing harm One common industry safety metric utilized by AEP to track incidents is the Days AwayRestricted or Transferred DART rate A DART event is an event that results in one or more lost days one or more restricted days or results in an employee transferring to a different job within the company The DART rate is a mathematical calculation number of DART events multiplied by 200000 work hours and divided by total YTD hours worked that describes the number of recordable injuries per 100 fulltime employees In 2020 AEP recognized its best safety performance in the past five years with an employee DART Rate of 0310 15 Diversity and Inclusion AEP is committed to cultivating a diverse and inclusive environment that supports the development and advancement of all We foster an inclusive workplace that encourages diversity of thought culture and background and actively work to eliminate

relationships to ensure we have a culture that attracts and supports employees who can adapt to the rapid changes occurring in our company and industry Our partnership with labor unions is critical to meeting the growing expectations of our customers and adapting to the challenges of rapidly changing technologies BUSINESS SEGMENTS AEPs Reportable Segments AEPs primary business is the generation transmission and distribution of electricity Within its Vertically Integrated Utilities segment AEP centrally dispatches generation assets and manages its overall utility operations on an integrated basis because of the substantial impact of costbased rates and regulatory oversight Intersegment sales and transfers are generally based on underlying contractual arrangements and agreements AEPs reportable segments are as follows  Vertically Integrated Utilities  Transmission and Distribution Utilities  AEP Transmission Holdco  Generation  Marketing The remainder of AEPs activities is presented as Corporate and Other which is not considered a reportable segment See Note 9  Business Segments included in the 2020 Annual Report for additional information on AEPs segments 17 VERTICALLY INTEGRATED UTILITIES GENERAL AEPs vertically integrated utility operations are engaged in the generation transmission and distribution of electricity for sale to retail and wholesale customers through assets owned and operated by AEGCo APCo IM KGPCo KPCo PSO SWEPCo and WPCo AEPSC as agent for AEPs public utility subsidiaries performs marketing generation dispatch fuel procurement and powerrelated risk management and trading activities on behalf of each of these subsidiaries ELECTRIC GENERATION Facilities As of December 31 2020 AEPs vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries owned or leased approximately 22000 MWs of domestic generation See Item 2  Properties for more information regarding the generation capacity of vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries Fuel Supply The following table shows the owned and leased generation sources by type including wind purchase agreements on an actual net generation MWhs basis used by the Vertically Integrated Utilities 2020 2019 2018 Coal and Lignite 45 54 58 Nuclear 24 19 18 Natural Gas 18 16 14 Renewables 13 11 10 A price increasedecrease in one or more fuel sources relative to other fuels as well as the addition of renewable resources or retirement of traditional fossil fuel units may result in the decreasedincreased use of other fuels AEPs overall 2020 fossil fuel costs for the Vertically Integrated Utilities decreased 3 on a dollar per MMBtu basis from 2019 Coal and Lignite AEPs Vertically Integrated Utilities procure coal and lignite under a combination of purchasing arrangements including longterm contracts affiliate operations and spot agreements with various producers marketers and coal trading firms Coal consumption in 2020 decreased approximately 27 from 2019 mainly due to lower dispatching of coal generation from weaker power market prices Management believes that the Vertically Integrated Utilities will be able to secure and transport coal and lignite of adequate quality and quantities to operate their coal and lignitefired units Through subsidiaries AEP owns leases or controls 3016 railcars 411 barges 6 towboats and a coal handling terminal with approximately 18 million tons of annual capacity to move and store coal for use in AEP generating facilities Spot market prices for coal weakened during the first half of 2020 before stabilizing or slightly rebounding in the second half of 2020 The decreased spot coal prices reflect lower demand for domestic and export coal AEPs strategy for purchasing coal includes layering in supplies over time The price impact of this process is reflected in subsequent periods and can occasionally cause current spot market prices to be trending opposite to the price of coal delivered The price paid for coal delivered in 2020 increased approximately 18 from 2019 mainly due to lignite mine related activities and closure costs 18 The following table shows the amount of coal and lignite delivered to the Vertically Integrated Utilities plants during the past three years and the average delivered price of coal and lignite purchased by the Vertically Integrated Utilities 2020 2019 2018 Total coal and lignite delivered to the plants in millions of tons 194 304 290 Average cost per ton of coal and lignite delivered  5395  4585  4321 The coal supplies at the Vertically Integrated Utilities plants vary from time to time depending on various factors including but not limited to demand for electric power unit outages transportation infrastructure limitations space limitations plant coal consumption rates availability of acceptable coals labor issues and weather conditions which may interrupt production or deliveries As of December 31 2020 the Vertically Integrated Utilities coal inventory was approximately 64 days of full load burn While inventory targets vary by plant and are changed as necessary the current coal inventory target for the Vertically Integrated Utilities is approximately 30 days of full load burn Natural Gas The Vertically Integrated Utilities consumed approximately 113 billion cubic feet of natural gas during 2020 for generating power This represents a decrease of 333 from 2019 Several of AEPs natural gasfired power plants are connected to at least two pipelines which allow greater access to competitive supplies and improve delivery reliability A portfolio of term monthly and daily supply and transportation agreements provide natural gas requirements for each plant as appropriate AEPs natural gas supply transactions are entered into on a competitive basis and based on market prices The following table shows the amount of natural gas delivered to the Vertically Integrated Utilities plants during the past three years and the average delivered price of natural gas purchased by the Vertically Integrated Utilities 2020 2019 2018 Total natural gas delivered to the plants in billions cubic feet 1131 1170 1116 Average delivered price per MMBtu of purchased natural gas  214  264  326 Nuclear IM has made commitments to meet the current nuclear fuel requirements of the Cook Plant IM has made and will make purchases of uranium in various forms in the spot shortterm and midterm markets IM also continues to finance its nuclear fuel through leasing For purposes of the storage of highlevel radioactive waste in the form of SNF IM completed modifications to its SNF storage pool in the early 1990s IM entered into an agreement to provide for onsite dry cask storage of SNF to permit normal operations to continue IM is scheduled to conduct further dry cask loading and storage projects on an ongoing periodic basis The year of expiration of each NRC Operating License is 2034 for Unit 1 and 2037 for Unit 2 Nuclear Waste and Decommissioning As the owner of the Cook Plant IM has a significant future financial commitment to dispose of SNF and decommission and decontaminate the plant safely The cost to decommission a nuclear plant is affected by NRC regulations and the SNF disposal program The most recent decommissioning cost study was completed in 2018 The estimated cost of decommissioning and disposal of lowlevel radioactive waste for the Cook Plant was 2 billion in 2018 nondiscounted dollars with additional ongoing estimated costs of 6 million per year for post decommissioning storage of SNF and an eventual estimated cost of 37 million for the subsequent decommissioning of the spent fuel storage facility also in 2018 nondiscounted dollars As of December 31 2020 and 2019 the total decommissioning trust fund balance for the Cook Plant was approximately 3 billion and 27 19 billion respectively The balance of funds available to eventually decommission Cook Plant will differ based on contributions and investment returns The ultimate cost of retiring the Cook Plant may be materially different from estimates and funding targets as a result of the  Escalation of various cost elements including but not limited to general inflation and the cost of energy  Further development of regulatory requirements governing decommissioning  Technology available at the time of decommissioning differing significantly from that assumed in studies  Availability of nuclear waste disposal facilities  Availability of a United States Department of Energy facility for permanent storage of SNF Accordingly management is unable to provide assurance that the ultimate cost of decommissioning the Cook Plant will not be significantly different than current projections AEP will seek recovery from customers through regulated rates if actual decommissioning costs exceed projections See the Nuclear Contingencies section of Note 6  Commitments Guarantees and Contingencies included in the 2020 Annual Report for additional information with respect to nuclear waste and decommissioning LowLevel Radioactive Waste The LowLevel Waste Policy Act of 1980 mandates that the responsibility for the disposal of lowlevel radioactive waste rests with the individual states Lowlevel radioactive waste consists largely of ordinary refuse and other items that have come in contact with radioactive materials Michigan does not currently have a disposal site for such waste available IM cannot predict when such a site may be available However the states of Utah and Texas have licensed lowlevel radioactive waste disposal sites which currently accept lowlevel radioactive waste from Michigan waste generators There is currently no set date limiting IMs access to either of these facilities The Cook Plant has a facility onsite designed specifically for the storage of lowlevel radioactive waste In the event that lowlevel radioactive waste disposal facility access becomes unavailable it can be stored onsite at this facility Counterparty Risk Management The Vertically Integrated Utilities segment also sells power and enters into related energy transactions with wholesale customers and other market participants As a result counterparties and exchanges may require cash or cash related instruments to be deposited on transactions as margin against open positions As of December 31 2020 counterparties posted approximately 13 million in cash cash equivalents or letters of credit with AEPSC for the benefit of AEPs public utility subsidiaries while as of that date AEPs public utility subsidiaries posted approximately 19 million with counterparties and exchanges Since open trading contracts are valued based on market prices of various commodities exposures change daily See the Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk section of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the 2020 Annual Report for additional information Certain Power Agreements IM The UPA between AEGCo and IM dated March 31 1982 the IM Power Agreement provides for the sale by AEGCo to IM of all the capacity and the energy associated therewith available to AEGCo at the Rockport Plant Whether or not power is available from AEGCo IM is obligated to pay a demand charge for the right to receive such power and an energy charge for any associated energy taken by IM The IM Power Agreement will continue in effect until the debt obligations of AEGCo secured by the Rockport Plant have been satisfied and discharged currently expected to be December 2028 20 Pursuant to an assignment between IM and KPCo and a UPA between AEGCo and KPCo AEGCo sells KPCo 30 of the capacity and the energy associated therewith available to AEGCo from both units of the Rockport Plant KPCo has agreed to pay to AEGCo the amounts that IM would have paid AEGCo under the terms of the UPA between AEGCo and IM for such entitlement The KPCo UPA expires in December 2022 OVEC AEP and several nonaffiliated utility companies jointly own OVEC The aggregate equity participation of AEP in OVEC is 4347 Parent owns 3917 and OPCo owns 43 Under the InterCompany Power Agreement ICPA which defines the rights of the owners and sets the power participation ratio of each the sponsoring companies are entitled to receive and are obligated to pay for all OVEC capacity approximately 2400 MWs in proportion to their respective power participation ratios The aggregate power participation ratio of APCo IM and OPCo is 4347 The ICPA terminates in June 2040 The proceeds from charges by OVEC to sponsoring companies under the ICPA based on their power participation ratios are designed to be sufficient for OVEC to meet its operating expenses and fixed costs OVECs Board of Directors as elected by AEP and nonaffiliated owners has authorized environmental investments related to their ownership interests with resulting expenses including for related debt and interest thereon included in charges under the ICPA OVEC financed capital expenditures totaling 13 billion in connection with flue gas desulfurization projects and the associated scrubber waste disposal landfills at its two generation plants through debt issuances including taxadvantaged debt issuances Both OVEC generation plants are operating with the new environmental controls inservice See Note 17  Variable Interest Entities and Equity Method Investments for additional information ELECTRIC DELIVERY General Other than AEGCo AEPs vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries own and operate transmission and distribution lines and other facilities to deliver electric power See Item 2  Properties for more information regarding the transmission and distribution lines Most of the transmission and distribution services are sold to retail customers of AEPs vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries in their service territories These sales are made at rates approved by the state utility commissions of the states in which they operate and in some instances approved by the FERC See Item 1 Business  Vertically Integrated Utilities  Regulation  Rates The FERC regulates and approves the rates for both wholesale transmission transactions and wholesale generation contracts The use and the recovery of costs associated with the transmission assets of the AEP vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are subject to the rules principles protocols and agreements in place with PJM and SPP and as approved by the FERC See Item 1 Business  Vertically Integrated Utilities  Regulation  FERC As discussed below some transmission services also are separately sold to nonaffiliated companies Other than AEGCo AEPs vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries hold franchises or other rights to provide electric service in various municipalities and regions in their service areas In some cases these franchises provide the utility with the exclusive right to provide electric service within a specific territory These franchises have varying provisions and expiration dates In general the operating companies consider their franchises to be adequate for the conduct of their business For a discussion of competition in the sale of power see Item 1 Business  Vertically Integrated Utilities  Competition Transmission Agreement APCo IM KGPCo KPCo and WPCo own and operate transmission facilities that are used to provide transmission service under the PJM OATT and are parties to the TA OPCo which is a subsidiary in AEPs Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment that provides transmission service under the PJM OATT is also a party to the TA The TA defines how the parties to the agreement share the revenues associated with their transmission facilities and the costs of transmission service provided by PJM The TA has been approved by the FERC 21 Transmission Coordination Agreement and Open Access Transmission Tariff PSO SWEPCo and AEPSC are parties to the TCA Under the TCA a coordinating committee is charged with the responsibility of a overseeing the coordinated planning of the transmission facilities of the parties to the agreement including the performance of transmission planning studies b the interaction of such subsidiaries with independent system operators and other regional bodies interested in transmission planning and c compliance with the terms of the OATT filed with the FERC and the rules of the FERC relating to such tariff Pursuant to the TCA AEPSC has responsibility for monitoring the reliability of their transmission systems and administering the OATT on behalf of the other parties to the agreement The TCA also provides for the allocation among the parties of revenues collected for transmission and ancillary services provided under the OATT These allocations have been determined by the FERCapproved OATT for the SPP Regional Transmission Organizations AEGCo APCo IM KGPCo KPCo and WPCo are members of PJM and PSO and SWEPCo are members of SPP both FERCapproved RTOs RTOs operate plan and control utility transmission assets in a manner designed to provide open access to such assets in a way that prevents discrimination between participants owning transmission assets and those that do not REGULATION General AEPs vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries retail rates and certain other matters are subject to traditional costbased regulation by the state utility commissions AEPs vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are also subject to regulation by the FERC under the Federal Power Act with respect to wholesale power and transmission service transactions IM is subject to regulation by the NRC under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 as amended with respect to the operation of the Cook Plant AEP and its vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are also subject to the regulatory provisions of much of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 which is administered by the FERC Rates Historically state utility commissions have established electric service rates on a costofservice basis which is designed to allow a utility an opportunity to recover its cost of providing service and to earn a reasonable return on its investment used in providing that service A utilitys costofservice generally reflects its operating expenses including operation and maintenance expense depreciation expense and taxes State utility commissions periodically adjust rates pursuant to a review of a a utilitys adjusted revenues and expenses during a defined test period and b such utilitys level of investment Absent a legal limitation such as a law limiting the frequency of rate changes or capping rates for a period of time a state utility commission can review and change rates on its own initiative Some states may initiate reviews at the request of a utility customer governmental or other representative of a group of customers Such parties may however agree with one another not to request reviews of or changes to rates for a specified period of time Public utilities have traditionally financed capital investments until the new asset is placed inservice Provided the asset was found to be a prudent investment it was then added to rate base and entitled to a return through rate recovery Given long lead times in construction the high costs of plant and equipment and volatile capital markets management actively pursues strategies to accelerate rate recognition of investments and cash flow AEP representatives continue to engage state commissioners and legislators on alternative ratemaking options to reduce regulatory lag and enhance certainty in the process These options include preapprovals a return on construction work in progress ridertrackers formula rates and the inclusion of future testyear projections into rates 22 The rates of AEPs vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are generally based on the cost of providing traditional bundled electric service ie generation transmission and distribution service Historically the state regulatory frameworks in the service area of the AEP vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries reflected specified fuel costs as part of bundled or more recently unbundled rates or incorporated fuel adjustment clauses in a utilitys rates and tariffs Fuel adjustment clauses permit periodic adjustments to fuel cost recovery from customers and therefore provide protection against exposure to fuel cost changes The following statebystate analysis summarizes the regulatory environment of certain major jurisdictions in which AEPs vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries operate Several public utility subsidiaries operate in more than one jurisdiction See Note 4  Rate Matters included in the 2020 Annual Report for more information regarding pending rate matters Indiana IM provides retail electric service in Indiana at bundled rates approved by the IURC with rates set on a costofservice basis Indiana provides for timely fuel and purchased power cost recovery through a fuel cost recovery mechanism Oklahoma PSO provides retail electric service in Oklahoma at bundled rates approved by the OCC PSOs rates are set on a costofservice basis Fuel and purchased energy costs are recovered or refunded by applying fuel adjustment and other factors to retail kilowatthour sales Virginia APCo currently provides retail electric service in Virginia at unbundled generation and distribution rates approved by the Virginia SCC Virginia generally allows for timely recovery of fuel costs through a FAC In addition to base rates and fuel cost recovery APCo is permitted to recover a variety of costs through rate adjustment clauses including transmission services provided at OATT rates based on rates established by the FERC West Virginia APCo and WPCo provide retail electric service at bundled rates approved by the WVPSC with rates set on a combined costofservice basis West Virginia generally allows for timely recovery of fuel costs through the ENEC which truesup to actual expenses FERC The FERC regulates rates for interstate power sales at wholesale transmission of electric power accounting and other matters including construction and operation of hydroelectric projects The FERC regulations require AEPs vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries to provide open access transmission service at FERCapproved rates and AEP has approved costbased formula transmission rates on file at the FERC The FERC also regulates unbundled transmission service to retail customers In addition the FERC regulates the sale of power for resale in interstate commerce by a approving contracts for wholesale sales to municipal and cooperative utilities and b granting authority to public utilities to sell power at wholesale at marketbased rates upon a showing that the seller lacks the ability to improperly influence market prices AEPs vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries have marketbased rate authority from the FERC under which much of their wholesale marketing activity takes place The FERC requires each public utility that owns or controls interstate transmission facilities directly or through an RTO to file an open access network and pointtopoint transmission tariff that offers services comparable to the utilitys own uses of its transmission system The FERC also requires all transmitting utilities directly or through an RTO to establish an Open Access Sametime Information System which electronically posts transmission information such as available capacity and prices and requires utilities to comply with Standards of Conduct that prohibit utilities transmission employees from providing nonpublic transmission information to the utilitys marketing employees Additionally the vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are subject to reliability standards promulgated by the NERC with the approval of the FERC 23 The FERC oversees RTOs entities created to operate plan and control utility transmission assets AEGCo APCo IM KGPCo KPCo and WPCo are members of PJM PSO and SWEPCo are members of SPP The FERC has jurisdiction over the issuances of securities of most of AEPs public utility subsidiaries the acquisition of securities of utilities the acquisition or sale of certain utility assets and mergers with another electric utility or holding company In addition both the FERC and state regulators are permitted to review the books and records of any company within a holding company system COMPETITION Other than AEGCo AEPs vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries generate transmit and distribute electricity to retail customers of AEPs vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries in their service territories These sales are made at rates approved by the state utility commissions of the states in which they operate and in some instances approved by the FERC and are not subject to competition from other vertically integrated public utilities Other than AEGCo AEPs vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries hold franchises or other rights that effectively grant the exclusive ability to provide electric service in various municipalities and regions in their service areas AEPs vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries compete with selfgeneration and with distributors of other energy sources such as natural gas fuel oil renewables and coal within their service areas The primary factors in such competition are price reliability of service and the capability of customers to utilize alternative sources of energy other than electric power With respect to competing generators and selfgeneration the public utility subsidiaries of AEP believe that they currently maintain a competitive position Changes in regulatory policies and advances in newer technologies for batteries or energy storage fuel cells microturbines wind turbines and photovoltaic solar cells are reducing costs of new technology to levels that are making them competitive with some central station electricity production The costs of photovoltaic solar cells in particular have continued to become increasingly competitive The ability to maintain relatively low cost efficient and reliable operations and to provide costeffective programs and services to customers are significant determinants of AEPs competitiveness SEASONALITY The consumption of electric power is generally seasonal In many parts of the country demand for power peaks during the hot summer months with market prices also peaking at that time In other areas power demand peaks during the winter The pattern of this fluctuation may change due to the nature and location of AEPs facilities and the terms of power sale contracts into which AEP enters In addition AEP has historically sold less power and consequently earned less income when weather conditions are milder Unusually mild weather in the future could diminish AEPs results of operations Conversely unusually extreme weather conditions could increase AEPs results of operations TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION UTILITIES GENERAL This segment consists of the transmission and distribution of electricity for sale to retail and wholesale customers through assets owned and operated by AEP Texas and OPCo OPCo is engaged in the transmission and distribution of electric power to approximately 1507000 retail customers in Ohio OPCo purchases energy and capacity to serve standard service offer customers and provides transmission and distribution services for all connected load AEP Texas is engaged in the transmission and distribution of electric power to approximately 1068000 retail customers through REPs in west central and southern Texas AEPs transmission and distribution utility subsidiaries own and operate transmission and distribution lines and other facilities to deliver electric power See Item 2  Properties for more information regarding the transmission 24 and distribution lines Transmission and distribution services are sold to retail customers of AEPs transmission and distribution utility subsidiaries in their service territories These sales are made at rates approved by the PUCT for AEP Texas and by the PUCO and the FERC for OPCo The FERC regulates and approves the rates for wholesale transmission transactions As discussed below some transmission services also are separately sold to nonaffiliated companies AEPs transmission and distribution utility subsidiaries hold franchises or other rights to provide electric service in various municipalities and regions in their service areas In some cases these franchises provide the utility with the exclusive right to provide electric service These franchises have varying provisions and expiration dates In general the operating companies consider their franchises to be adequate for the conduct of their business The use and the recovery of costs associated with the transmission assets of the AEP transmission and distribution utility subsidiaries are subject to the rules protocols and agreements in place with PJM and ERCOT and as approved by the FERC In addition to providing transmission services in connection with power sales in their service areas AEPs transmission and distribution utility subsidiaries also provide transmission services for nonaffiliated companies through RTOs Transmission Agreement OPCo owns and operates transmission facilities that are used to provide transmission service under the PJM OATT OPCo is a party to the TA with other utility subsidiary affiliates The TA defines how the parties to the agreement share the revenues associated with their transmission facilities and the costs of transmission service provided by PJM The TA has been approved by the FERC Regional Transmission Organizations OPCo is a member of PJM a FERCapproved RTO RTOs operate plan and control utility transmission assets to provide open access to such assets in a way that prevents discrimination between participants owning transmission assets and those that do not AEP Texas is a member of ERCOT REGULATION OPCo provides distribution and transmission services to retail customers within its service territory at costbased rates approved by the PUCO or by the FERC AEP Texas provides transmission and distribution service on a costofservice basis at rates approved by the PUCT and wholesale transmission service under tariffs approved by the FERC consistent with PUCT rules Transmission and distribution rates are established on a costofservice basis which is designed to allow a utility an opportunity to recover its cost of providing service and to earn a reasonable return on its investment used in providing that service The costofservice generally reflects operating expenses including operation and maintenance expense depreciation expense and taxes Utility commissions periodically adjust rates pursuant to a review of a a utilitys adjusted revenues and expenses during a defined test period and b such utilitys level of investment FERC The FERC regulates rates for transmission of electric power accounting and other matters The FERC regulations require AEP to provide open access transmission service at FERCapproved rates and it has approved costbased formula transmission rates on file at the FERC The FERC also regulates unbundled transmission service to retail customers The FERC requires each public utility that owns or controls interstate transmission facilities to directly or through an RTO file an open access network and pointtopoint transmission tariff that offers services comparable to the utilitys own uses of its transmission system The FERC also requires all transmitting utilities directly or through an RTO to establish an Open Access Sametime Information System which electronically posts transmission information such as available capacity and prices and requires utilities to comply with Standards of Conduct that prohibit utilities transmission employees from providing nonpublic transmission information to the utilitys marketing employees In addition both the FERC and state regulators are permitted to review the books 25 and records of any company within a holding company system Additionally the transmission and distribution utility subsidiaries are subject to reliability standards as set forth by the NERC with the approval of the FERC SEASONALITY The delivery of electric power is generally seasonal In many parts of the country demand for power peaks during the hot summer months In other areas power demand peaks during the winter months The pattern of this fluctuation may change due to the nature and location of AEPs transmission and distribution facilities In addition AEP transmission and distribution has historically delivered less power and consequently earned less income when weather conditions are milder In Texas and to a lesser extent in Ohio where there is residential decoupling unusually mild weather in the future could diminish AEPs results of operations Conversely unusually extreme weather conditions could increase AEPs results of operations AEP TRANSMISSION HOLDCO GENERAL AEPTHCo is a holding company for a AEPTCo which is the direct holding company for the State Transcos and b AEPs Transmission Joint Ventures AEPTCo AEPTCo wholly owns the State Transcos which are independent of but respectively overlay the following AEP electric utility operating companies APCo IM KPCo OPCo PSO SWEPCo and WPCo The State Transcos develop own operate and

license agreement that will support APTCo investment in the state of Tennessee SWTCo does not currently own or operate transmission assets The State Transcos are regulated for ratemaking purposes exclusively by the FERC and earn revenues through tariff rates charged for the use of their electric transmission systems The State Transcos establish transmission rates each year through formula rate filings with the FERC The rate filings calculate the revenue requirement needed to cover the costs of operation and debt service and to earn an allowed ROE These rates are then included in an OATT for PJM MISO and SPP The State Transcos own operate maintain and invest in transmission infrastructure in order to maintain and enhance system integrity and grid reliability grid security safety reduce transmission constraints and facilitate interconnections of new generating resources and new wholesale customers as well as enhance competitive wholesale electricity markets A key part of AEPs business is replacing and upgrading transmission facilities assets and components of the existing AEP System as needed to maintain reliability The State Transcos provide the capability to build replace and upgrade existing facilities As of December 31 2020 the State Transcos had 99 billion of transmission and other assets inservice with plans to construct approximately 42 billion of additional transmission assets through 2023 Additional investment in transmission infrastructure is needed within PJM and SPP to maintain the required level of grid reliability resiliency security and efficiency and to address an aging transmission infrastructure Additional transmission facilities will be needed based on changes in generating resources such as wind or solar projects generation additions or retirements and additional new customer interconnections The State Transcos will continue their investment to enhance physical and cyber security of assets and are also investing in improving the telecommunication network that supports the operation and control of the grid 26 AEPTHCO JOINT VENTURE INITIATIVES AEP has established joint ventures with other electric utility

forwardlooking formula rate filings with the FERC pursuant to FERCapproved implementation protocols The protocols include a transparent formal review process to ensure the updated transmission rates are prudentlyincurred and reasonably calculated The IMTCoowned Greentown station assets acquired from Duke Energy Indiana LLC in December 2018 are located in MISO IMTCo utilizes a historic cost recovery model to recover MISO assets The State Transcos and the Transmission Joint Ventures where applicable rates are included in the respective OATT for PJM and SPP An OATT is the FERC rate schedule that provides the terms and conditions for transmission and related services on a transmission providers transmission system The FERC requires transmission providers such as PJM and SPP to offer transmission service to all eligible customers for example loadserving entities power marketers generators and customers on a nondiscriminatory basis The FERCapproved formula rates establish the annual transmission revenue requirement ATRR and transmission service rates for transmission owners in annual rate base filings with the FERC The formula rates establish rates for a oneyear period based on the current projects inservice and proposed projects for a defined timeframe The formula rates also include a trueup calculation for the previous years billings allowing for overunderrecovery of the transmission owners ATRR PJM and SPP pay the transmission owners their ATRR for use of their facilities and bill transmission customers taking service under the PJM and SPP OATTs based on the terms and conditions in the respective OATT for the service taken Additionally the State Transcos are subject to reliability standards promulgated by the NERC with the approval of the FERC Management continues to monitor the FERCs 2019 Notice of Inquiry regarding base ROE policy the FERCs 2020 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking regarding transmission incentives policy and various other matters pending before the FERC with the potential to affect the transmission ROE methodology In the second quarter of 2019 the FERC approved settlement agreements establishing base ROEs of 985 1035 inclusive of RTO incentive adder of 05 and 10 105 inclusive of RTO incentive adder of 05 for AEPs PJM and SPP transmissionowning subsidiaries respectively In the second quarter of 2020 FERC Order 569A determined the base ROE for MISOs transmission owning members including AEPs MISO transmissionowning subsidiaries should be 1002 1052 inclusive of the RTO incentive adder of 05 If the FERC makes any changes to its ROE and incentive policies they would be applied as applicable to AEPs PJM SPP and MISO transmission owning subsidiaries on a prospective basis and could affect future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition In the annual rate base filings described above the State Transcos in aggregate filed rate base totals of 70 billion 59 billion and 46 billion for 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively The total filed transmission revenue requirements including prior year overunderrecovery of revenue and associated carrying charges were 12 billion 992 million and 829 million for 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively The rates of ETT which is located in ERCOT are determined by the PUCT ETT sets its rates through a combination of base rate cases and interim Transmission Cost of Services TCOS filings ETT may file interim TCOS filings semiannually to update its rates to reflect changes in its net invested capital The Transmission Joint Ventures have approved ROEs ranging from 96 to 128 based on equity capital structures ranging from 40 to 60 28 GENERATION  MARKETING GENERAL The AEP Generation  Marketing segment subsidiaries consist of a wholesale energy trading and marketing business a retail supply and energy management business and competitive generating assets AEP Energy Supply LLC is a holding company with several divisions including AEP Renewables and AEP OnSite Partners AEP Renewables develops owns and operates utility scale renewable projects backed with longterm contracts with creditworthy counterparties throughout the United States AEP Renewables works directly with stakeholders to ensure that customers have clean sustainable renewable energy to meet their environmental goals As of December 31 2020 AEP Renewables owned projects operating in 11 states including approximately 1307 MWs of installed wind capacity and 90 MWs of installed solar capacity In October 2019 AEP Renewables entered into an agreement to construct Flat Ridge 3 a wind farm in Kansas The 128 MW facility is expected to reach commercial operation by May 2021 In November 2020 AEP Renewables signed a Purchase and Sale Agreement to acquire 75 of the Dry Lake Solar Project a 100 MW solar facility in southern Nevada This facility is expected to be inservice in the second quarter of 2021 AEP OnSite Partners works directly with wholesale and large retail customers to provide tailored solutions to reduce their energy costs based upon market knowledge innovative applications of technology and deal structuring capabilities AEP OnSite Partners targets opportunities in distributed solar combined heat and power energy storage waste heat recovery energy efficiency peaking generation and other energy solutions that create value for customers AEP OnSite Partners pursues and develops behind the meter projects with creditworthy customers As of December 31 2020 AEP OnSite Partners owned projects located in 21 states including approximately 152 MWs of installed solar capacity and approximately 9 MWs of solar projects under construction With respect to the wholesale energy trading and marketing business AEP Generation  Marketing segment subsidiaries enter into shortterm and longterm transactions to buy or sell capacity energy and ancillary services in ERCOT SPP MISO and PJM These subsidiaries sell power into the market and engage in power natural gas and emissions allowances risk management and trading activities These activities primarily involve the purchaseandsale of electricity and to a lesser extent natural gas and emissions allowances under forward contracts at fixed and variable prices These contracts include physical transactions exchangetraded futures and to a lesser extent OTC swaps and options The majority of forward contracts are typically settled by entering into offsetting contracts These transactions are executed with numerous counterparties or on exchanges With respect to the retail supply and energy management business AEP Energy is a retail energy supplier that supplies electricity andor natural gas to residential commercial and industrial customers AEP Energy provides various energy solutions in Illinois Pennsylvania Delaware Maryland New Jersey Ohio and Washington DC AEP Energy had approximately 510000 customer accounts as of December 31 2020 The primary fossil generation subsidiary in the Generation  Marketing segment is AGR As of December 31 2020 AGR owns 643 MWs of generating capacity almost all of which is operated by Buckeye Power a nonaffiliated electric cooperative Other subsidiaries in this segment own or have the right to receive power from additional generation assets  See Item 2  Properties for more information regarding the generation assets of the Generation  Marketing segment AGR is a competitive generation subsidiary REGULATION AGR is a public utility under the Federal Power Act and is subject to the FERCs exclusive ratemaking jurisdiction over wholesale sales of electricity and the transmission of electricity in interstate commerce Under the Federal Power Act the FERC has the authority to grant or deny marketbased rates for sales of energy capacity and ancillary services to ensure that such sales are just and reasonable The FERC granted AGR marketbased rate authority in December 2013 The FERCs jurisdiction over ratemaking also includes the authority to suspend the 29 marketbased rates of AGR and set costbased rates if the FERC subsequently determines that it can exercise market power create barriers to entry or engage in abusive affiliate transactions Periodically AGR is required to file a market power update to show that it continues to meet the FERCs standards with respect to generation market power and other criteria used to evaluate whether it continues to qualify for marketbased rates Other matters subject to the FERC jurisdiction include but are not limited to review of mergers and dispositions of jurisdictional facilities and acquisitions of securities of another public utility or an existing operational generating facility Specific operations of AGR are also subject to the jurisdiction of various other federal state regional and local agencies including federal and state environmental protection agencies AGR is also regulated by the PUCT for transactions inside ERCOT Additionally AGR is subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the NERC with the approval of the FERC COMPETITION The AEP Generation  Marketing segment subsidiaries face competition for the sale of available power capacity and ancillary services The principal factors of impact are electricity and fuel prices new market entrants construction or retirement of generating assets by others and technological advances in power generation Because most of AGRs remaining generation is coalfired lower relative natural gas prices will favor competitors that have a higher concentration of natural gas fueled generation Other factors impacting competitiveness include environmental regulation transmission congestion or transportation constraints at or near generation facilities inoperability or inefficiencies outages and deactivations and retirements at generation facilities Technology advancements increased demand for clean energy changing consumer behaviors lowpriced and abundant natural gas and regulatory and public policy reforms are among the catalysts for transformation within the industry that impact competition for AEPs Generation  Marketing segment AGR also competes with selfgeneration and with distributors of other energy sources such as natural gas fuel oil renewables and coal within their service areas The primary factors in such competition are price unit availability and the capability of customers to utilize sources of energy other than electric power Changes in regulatory policies and advances in newer technologies for batteries or energy storage fuel cells microturbines wind turbines and photovoltaic solar cells are reducing costs of new technology to levels that are making them competitive with some central station electricity production The ability to maintain relatively low cost efficient and reliable operations and to provide costeffective programs and services to customers are significant determinants of AGRs competitiveness The costs of photovoltaic solar cells in particular have continued to become increasingly competitive This segments retail operations provide competitive electricity and natural gas in deregulated retail energy markets in six states and Washington DC Each such retail choice jurisdiction establishes its own laws and regulations governing its competitive market and public utility commission communications and utility default service pricing can affect customer participation in retail competition Sustained low natural gas and power prices low market volatility and maturing competitive environments can adversely affect this business This segment also engages in procuring and selling output from renewable generation sources under longterm contracts to creditworthy counterparties New sources are not acquired without first securing a longterm placement of such power Existing sources do not face competitive exposure Competitive nonaffiliated suppliers of renewable or other generation could limit opportunities for future transactions for new sources and related output contracts SEASONALITY The consumption of electric power is generally seasonal In many parts of the country demand for power peaks during the hot summer months with market prices also peaking at that time In other areas power demand peaks during the winter months The pattern of this fluctuation may change 30 Fuel Supply The following table shows the generation sources by type on an actual net generation MWhs basis used by the Generation  Marketing segment not including AEP Energy Partners offtake agreement from the Oklaunion Power Station which was retired in September 2020 2020 2019 2018 Coal 46 64 88 Renewables 54 36 12 Coal and Consumables AGR procures coal and consumables needed to burn the coal under a combination of purchasing arrangements including longterm and spot contracts with various producers and coal trading firms As contracts expire they are replaced as needed with contracts at market prices Coal and consumable inventories remain adequate to meet generation requirements Management believes that AGR will be able to secure and transport coal and consumables of adequate quality and in adequate quantities to operate its coalfired unit AGR through its contracts with thirdparty transporters has the ability to adequately move and store coal and consumables for use in its generating facility AGR plants consumed 16 million tons of coal in 2020 The coal supplies at AGRs plant vary from time to time depending on various factors including but not limited to demand for electric power unit outages transportation infrastructure limitations space limitations plant coal consumption rates coal quality availability of acceptable coals labor issues and weather conditions which may interrupt production or deliveries AGR aims to maintain the coal inventory of its managed plant in the range of 20 to 60 days of full load burn As of December 31 2020 the coal inventory of AGR was within the target range Counterparty Risk Management Counterparties and exchanges may require cash or cash related instruments to be deposited on these transactions as margin against open positions As of December 31 2020 counterparties posted approximately 29 million in cash cash equivalents or letters of credit with AEP for the benefit of AEPs Generation  Marketing segment subsidiaries while as of that date AEPs Generation  Marketing segment subsidiaries posted approximately 122 million with counterparties and exchanges Since open trading contracts are valued based on market prices of various commodities exposures change daily See the Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk section of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the 2020 Annual Report for additional information Certain Power Agreements As of December 31 2020 the assets utilized in this segment included approximately 1307 MWs of companyowned domestic wind power facilities and 101 MWs of domestic wind power from longterm purchase power agreements Additional long term purchased power agreements have been entered into for 712 MWs of wind and 200 MWs of solar capacity which are all under construction These agreements are all contingent on completion of construction which is expected by the end of 2022 An agreement which transferred 355 MWs of coalfired capacity from the Oklaunion Power Station to this segment was terminated upon the closure of the facility in October 31 INFORMATION ABOUT OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS The following persons are

Supply Age 60 Executive Vice President  Energy Supply since January 2013 33 ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS GENERAL RISKS OF REGULATED OPERATIONS AEP may not be able to recover the costs of substantial planned investment in capital improvements and additions Applies to all Registrants AEPs business plan calls for extensive investment in capital improvements and additions including the construction of additional transmission facilities modernizing existing infrastructure installation of environmental upgrades and retrofits as well as other initiatives AEPs public utility subsidiaries currently provide service at rates approved by one or more regulatory commissions If these regulatory commissions do not approve adjustments to the rates charged affected AEP subsidiaries would not be able to recover the costs associated with their investments This would cause financial results to be diminished Regulated electric revenues and earnings are dependent on federal and state regulation that may limit AEPs ability to recover costs and other amounts Applies to all Registrants The rates customers pay to AEP regulated utility businesses are subject to approval by the FERC and the respective state utility commissions of Arkansas Indiana Kentucky Louisiana Michigan Ohio Oklahoma Tennessee Texas Virginia and West Virginia In certain instances AEPs applicable regulated utility businesses may agree to negotiated settlements related to various rate matters that are subject to regulatory approval AEP cannot predict the ultimate outcomes of any settlements or the actions by the FERC or the respective state commissions in establishing rates If regulated utility earnings exceed the returns established by the relevant commissions retail electric rates may be subject to review and possible reduction by the commissions which may decrease future earnings Additionally if regulatory bodies do not allow recovery of costs incurred in providing service on a timely basis it could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition Similarly if recovery or other rate relief authorized in the past is overturned or reversed on appeal future earnings could be negatively impacted Any regulatory action or litigation outcome that triggers a reversal of a regulatory asset or deferred cost generally results in an impairment to the balance sheet and a charge to the income statement of the company involved See Note 4  Rate Matters included in the 2020 Annual Report for additional information AEPs transmission investment strategy and execution are dependent on federal and state regulatory policy Applies to all Registrants A significant portion of AEPs earnings is derived from transmission investments and activities FERC policy currently favors the expansion and updating of the transmission infrastructure within its jurisdiction If the FERC were to adopt a different policy if states were to limit or restrict such policies or if transmission needs do not continue or develop as projected AEPs strategy of investing in transmission could be impacted Management believes AEPs experience with transmission facilities construction and operation gives AEP an advantage over other competitors in securing authorization to install construct and operate new transmission lines and facilities However there can be no assurance that PJM SPP ERCOT or other RTOs will authorize new transmission projects or will award such projects to AEP Certain elements of AEPs transmission formula rates have been challenged which could result in lowered rates andor refunds of amounts previously collected and thus have an adverse effect on AEPs business financial condition results of operations and cash flows Applies to all Registrants other than AEP Texas AEP provides transmission service under rates regulated by the FERC The FERC has approved the costbased formula rate templates used by AEP to calculate its respective annual revenue requirements but it has not expressly approved the amount of actual capital and operating expenditures to be used in the formula rates All aspects of AEPs rates accepted or approved by the FERC including the formula rate templates the rates of return on the 34 actual equity portion of its respective capital structures and the approved targeted capital structures are subject to challenge by interested parties at the FERC or by the FERC on its own initiative In addition interested parties may challenge the annual implementation and calculation by AEP of its projected rates and formula rate trueup pursuant to its approved formula rate templates under AEPs formula rate implementation protocols If a challenger can establish that any of these aspects are unjust unreasonable unduly discriminatory or preferential then the FERC can make appropriate prospective adjustments to them andor disallow any of AEPs inclusion of those aspects in the rate setting formula AEP settled challenges to its SPP and PJM formula rates in proceedings at the FERC in 2019 However inquiries related to rates of return as well as challenges to the formula rates of other utilities are ongoing in other proceedings at the FERC The results of these proceedings could potentially negatively impact AEP in any future challenges to AEPs formula rates If the FERC orders revenue reductions including refunds in any future cases related to its formula rates it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition Enduse consumers and entities supplying electricity to enduse consumers may also attempt to influence government andor regulators to change the rate setting methodologies that apply to AEP particularly if rates for delivered electricity increase substantially AEP faces risks related to project siting financing construction permitting governmental approvals and the negotiation of project development agreements that may impede their development and operating activities Applies to all Registrants AEP owns develops constructs manages and operates electric generation transmission and distribution facilities A key component of AEPs growth is its ability to construct and operate these facilities As part of these operations AEP must periodically apply for licenses and permits from various local state federal and other regulatory authorities and abide by their respective conditions Should AEP be unsuccessful in obtaining necessary licenses or permits on acceptable terms or resolving thirdparty challenges to such licenses or permits should there be a delay in obtaining or renewing necessary licenses or permits or should regulatory authorities initiate any associated investigations or enforcement actions or impose related penalties or disallowances it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition Any failure to negotiate successful project development agreements for new facilities with thirdparties could have similar results Changes in technology and regulatory policies may lower the value of electric utility facilities and franchises Applies to all Registrants AEP primarily generates electricity at large central facilities and delivers that electricity to customers over its transmission and distribution facilities to customers usually situated within an exclusive franchise This method results in economies of scale and generally lower costs than newer technologies such as fuel cells and microturbines and distributed generation using either new or existing technology Other technologies such as light emitting diodes LEDs increase the efficiency of electricity and as a result lower the demand for it Changes in regulatory policies and advances in batteries or energy storage wind turbines and photovoltaic solar cells are reducing costs of new technology to levels that are making them competitive with some central station electricity production and delivery These developments can challenge AEPs competitive ability to maintain relatively low cost efficient and reliable operations to establish fair regulatory mechanisms and to provide costeffective programs and services to customers Further in the event that alternative generation resources are mandated subsidized or encouraged through legislation or regulation or otherwise are economically competitive and added to the available generation supply such resources could displace a higher marginal cost generating units which could reduce the price at which market participants sell their electricity 35 AEP may not recover costs incurred to begin construction on projects that are canceled Applies to all Registrants AEPs business plan for the construction of new projects involves a number of risks including construction delays nonperformance by equipment and other thirdparty suppliers and increases in equipment and labor costs To limit the risks of these construction projects AEPs subsidiaries enter into equipment purchase orders and construction contracts and incur engineering and design service costs in advance of receiving necessary regulatory approvals andor siting or environmental permits If any of these projects are canceled for any reason including failure to receive necessary regulatory approvals andor siting or environmental permits significant cancellation penalties under the equipment purchase orders and construction contracts could occur In addition if any construction work or investments have been recorded as an asset an impairment may need to be recorded in the event the project is canceled AEP is exposed to nuclear generation risk Applies to AEP and IM IM owns the Cook Plant which consists of two nuclear generating units for a rated capacity of 2288 MWs or about 7 of the generating capacity in the AEP System AEP and IM are therefore subject to the risks of nuclear generation which include the following  The potential harmful effects on the environment and human health due to an adverse incidentevent resulting from the operation of nuclear facilities and the storage handling and disposal of radioactive materials such as SNF  Limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with nuclear operations  Uncertainties with respect to contingencies and assessment amounts triggered by a loss event federal law requires owners of nuclear units to purchase the maximum available amount of nuclear liability insurance and potentially contribute to the coverage for losses of others  Uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives There can be no assurance that IMs preparations or risk mitigation measures will be adequate if these risks are triggered The NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safetyrelated requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities In the event of noncompliance the NRC has the authority to impose fines or shut down a unit or both depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation until compliance is achieved Revised safety requirements promulgated by the NRC could necessitate substantial capital expenditures at nuclear plants In addition although management has no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at the Cook Plant if an incident did occur it could harm results of operations or financial condition A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit Moreover a major incident at any nuclear facility in the US could require AEP or IM to make material contributory payments Costs associated with the operation including fuel maintenance and retirement of nuclear plants continue to be more significant and less predictable than costs associated with other sources of generation in large part due to changing regulatory requirements and safety standards availability of nuclear waste disposal facilities and experience gained in the operation of nuclear facilities Costs also may include replacement power any unamortized investment at the end of the useful life of the Cook Plant whether scheduled or premature the carrying costs of that investment and retirement costs The ability to obtain adequate and timely recovery of costs associated with the Cook Plant is not assured 36 AEP subsidiaries are exposed to risks through participation in the market and transmission structures in various regional power markets that are beyond their control Applies to all Registrants Results are likely to be affected by differences in the market and transmission structures in various regional power markets The rules governing the various RTOs including SPP and PJM may also change from time to time which could affect costs or revenues Existing new or changed rules of these RTOs could result in significant additional fees and increased costs to participate in those structures including the cost of transmission facilities built by others due to changes in transmission rate design In addition these RTOs may assess costs resulting from improved transmission reliability reduced transmission congestion and firm transmission rights As members of these RTOs AEPs subsidiaries are subject to certain additional risks including the allocation among existing members of losses caused by unreimbursed defaults of other participants in these markets and resolution of complaint cases that may seek refunds of revenues previously earned by members of these markets AEP could be subject to higher costs andor penalties related to mandatory reliability standards Applies to all Registrants Owners and operators of the bulk power transmission system are subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the NERC and enforced by the FERC The standards are based on the functions that need to be performed to ensure the bulk power system operates reliably and are guided by reliability and market interface principles Compliance with new reliability standards may subject AEP to higher operating costs andor increased capital expenditures While management expects to recover costs and expenditures from customers through regulated rates there can be no assurance that the applicable commissions will approve full recovery in a timely manner If AEP were found not to be in compliance with the mandatory reliability standards AEP could be subject to sanctions including substantial monetary penalties which likely would not be recoverable from customers through regulated rates A substantial portion of the receivables of AEP Texas is concentrated in a small number of REPs and any delay or default in payment could adversely affect its cash flows financial condition and results of operations Applies to AEP and AEP Texas AEP Texas collects receivables from the distribution of electricity from REPs that supply the electricity it distributes to its customers As of December 31 2020 AEP Texas did business with approximately 122 REPs Adverse economic conditions structural problems in the market served by ERCOT or financial difficulties of one or more REPs could impair the ability of these REPs to pay for these services or could cause them to delay such payments AEP Texas depends on these REPs to remit payments on a timely basis Applicable regulatory provisions require that customers be shifted to another REP or a provider of last resort if a REP cannot make timely payments Applicable PUCT regulations significantly limit the extent to which AEP Texas can apply normal commercial terms or otherwise seek credit protection from firms desiring to provide retail electric service in its service territory and AEP Texas thus remains at risk for payments related to services provided prior to the shift to another REP or the provider of last resort In 2020 AEP Texas three largest REPs accounted for 46 of its operating revenue Any delay or default in payment by REPs could adversely affect cash flows financial condition and results of operations If a REP were unable to meet its obligations it could consider among various options restructuring under the bankruptcy laws in which event such REP might seek to avoid honoring its obligations and claims might be made by creditors involving payments AEP Texas had received from such REP Ohio House Bill 6 HB 6 which provides for beneficial cost recovery for OPCo and for plants owned by OVEC has come under public scrutiny Applies to AEP and OPCo In 2019 Ohio adopted and implemented HB 6 which benefits OPCo by authorizing rate recovery for certain costs including renewable energy contracts OVECs coalfired generating units and energy efficiency measures AEP and OPCo engaged in lobbying efforts and provided testimony during the legislative process in connection with HB 6 In July 2020 an investigation led by the US Attorneys Office resulted in a federal grand jury indictment of an Ohio legislator and associates in connection with an alleged racketeering conspiracy involving the adoption of HB 37 6 The outcome of the US Attorneys Office investigation and its impact on HB 6 is not known If the provisions of HB 6 were to be eliminated it is unclear whether new legislation addressing similar issues would be adopted To the extent that OPCo is unable to recover the costs currently authorized by HB 6 it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition In addition the impact of continued public scrutiny of HB 6 is not known and may have an adverse impact on AEP and OPCo including their relationship with regulatory and legislative authorities customers and other stakeholders AEP is a defendant in current litigation relating to HB6 and AEP or OPCo may be involved in future litigation RISKS RELATED TO MARKET ECONOMIC OR FINANCIAL VOLATILITY AND OTHER RISKS AEPs financial condition and results of operations could continue to be adversely affected by the ongoing Coronavirus pandemic Applies to all Registrants The global 2019 novel coronavirus pandemic is an evolving situation that could lead to extended disruption of economic activity in AEPs markets COVID19 could negatively affect AEPs ability to operate its generating and transmission and distribution assets its ability to access capital markets and results of operations AEP currently cannot estimate the potential impact to its financial position results of operations and cash flows caused by COVID19 which will depend on future developments and which are highly uncertain at this time See Item 2 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Executive Overview for additional information on COVID19 AEPs financial performance may be adversely affected if AEP is unable to successfully operate facilities or perform certain corporate functions Applies to all Registrants Performance is highly dependent on the successful operation of generation transmission andor distribution facilities Operating these facilities involves many risks including  Operator error and breakdown or failure of equipment or processes  Operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements  Labor disputes  Compliance with mandatory reliability standards including mandatory cyber security standards  Information technology failure that impairs AEPs information technology infrastructure or disrupts normal business operations  Information technology failure that affects AEPs ability to access customer information or causes loss of confidential or proprietary data that materially and adversely affects AEPs reputation or exposes AEP to legal claims  Fuel or water supply interruptions caused by transportation constraints adverse weather such as drought nonperformance by suppliers and other factors  Catastrophic events such as fires earthquakes explosions hurricanes tornados ice storms terrorism including cyberterrorism floods or other similar occurrences  Fuel costs and related requirements triggered by financial stress in the coal industry Physical attacks or hostile cyber intrusions could severely impair operations lead to the disclosure of confidential information and damage AEPs reputation Applies to all Registrants AEP and its regulated utility businesses face physical security and cybersecurity risks as the owneroperators of generation transmission andor distribution facilities and as participants in commodities trading AEP and its regulated utility businesses own assets deemed as critical infrastructure the operation of which is dependent on information technology systems Further the computer systems that run these facilities are not completely isolated from external networks Parties that wish to disrupt the US bulk power system or AEP operations could view these computer systems software or networks as targets for cyberattack In addition the electric utility business requires the collection of sensitive customer data as well as confidential employee and shareholder information which is subject to electronic theft or loss 38 A security breach of AEP or its regulated utility businesses physical assets or information systems interconnected entities in RTOs or regulators could impact the operation of the generation fleet andor reliability of the transmission and distribution system AEP and its regulated utility businesses could be subject to financial harm associated with theft or inappropriate release of certain types of information including sensitive customer vendor employee trading or other confidential data A successful cyberattack on the systems that control generation transmission distribution or other assets could severely disrupt business operations preventing service to customers or collection of revenues The breach of certain business systems could affect the ability to correctly record process and report financial information A major cyber incident could result in significant expenses to investigate and repair security breaches or system damage and could lead to litigation fines other remedial action heightened regulatory scrutiny and damage to AEPs reputation In addition the misappropriation corruption or loss of personally identifiable information and other confidential data could lead to significant breach notification expenses and mitigation expenses such as credit monitoring For these reasons a significant cyber incident could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition If AEP is unable to access capital markets or insurance markets on reasonable terms it could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition Applies to all Registrants AEP relies on access to capital markets as a significant source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by operating cash flows AEP also relies on access to insurance markets to assist in managing its risk and liability profile Volatility increased interest rates and reduced liquidity in the financial markets could affect AEPs ability to raise capital on reasonable terms to fund capital needs including construction costs and refinancing maturing indebtedness Certain sources of insurance and debt and equity capital have expressed increasing unwillingness to procure insurance for or to invest in companies such as AEP that rely on fossil fuels If sources of capital for AEP are reduced capital costs could increase materially Restricted access to capital or insurance markets andor increased borrowing costs or insurance premiums could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition Shareholder activism could cause AEP to incur significant expense hinder execution of AEPs business strategy and impact AEPs stock price Applies to all Registrants Shareholder activism which can take many forms and arise in a variety of situations could result in substantial costs and divert managements and AEPs boards attention and resources from AEPs business Additionally such shareholder activism could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to AEPs future adversely affect AEPs relationships with its employees customers or service providers and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel Also AEP may be required to incur significant fees and other expenses related to activist shareholder matters including for thirdparty advisors AEPs stock price could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the events risks and uncertainties of any shareholder activism The announced phasing out of LIBOR after 2021 may adversely affect the costs and availability of financing Applies to all Registrants A portion of the Registrants indebtedness bears interest at fluctuating interest rates primarily based on the London interbank offered rate LIBOR for deposits of US dollars On July 27 2017 the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom announced that it would phase out LIBOR as a benchmark by the end of 2021 Subsequently on November 30 2020 the Federal Reserve and the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom announced that LIBOR would be phased out completely by June 20 2023 and replaced by the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR While this announcement extends the transition period to June 2023 the United States Federal Reserve concurrently issued a statement advising banks to stop new US dollar LIBOR issuances by the end of 2021 However because SOFR is a broad US Treasury repo financing rate that represents overnight secured funding transactions it differs fundamentally from US dollar LIBOR In addition the overall financial markets may be disrupted as a result of the phaseout or replacement of LIBOR Uncertainty as to the nature of such phaseout and alternative reference rates or disruption in the financial market could cause interest rates to increase If sources of capital for the Registrants are reduced capital costs could increase materially Restricted access to capital markets andor increased borrowing costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition andor liquidity 39 Downgrades in AEPs credit ratings could negatively affect its ability to access capital Applies to all Registrants The credit ratings agencies periodically review AEPs capital structure and the quality and stability of earnings and cash flows Any negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to AEP and could limit access to funding for operations AEPs business is capital intensive and AEP is dependent upon the ability to access capital at rates and on terms management determines to be attractive If AEPs ability to access capital becomes significantly constrained AEPs interest costs will likely increase and could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition AEP and AEPTCo have no income or cash flow apart from dividends paid or other payments due from their subsidiaries Applies to AEP and AEPTCo AEP and AEPTCo are holding companies and have no operations of their own Their ability to meet their financial obligations associated with their indebtedness and to pay dividends is primarily dependent on the earnings and cash flows of their operating subsidiaries primarily their regulated utilities and the ability of their subsidiaries to pay dividends to or repay loans from them Their subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities that have no obligation apart from loans from AEP or AEPTCo to provide them with funds for their payment obligations whether by dividends distributions or other payments Payments to AEP or AEPTCo by their subsidiaries are also contingent upon their earnings and business considerations AEP and AEPTCo indebtedness and dividends are structurally subordinated to all subsidiary indebtedness AEPs operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal or quarterly basis and with general economic and weather conditions Applies to all Registrants Electric power consumption is generally seasonal In many parts of the country demand for power peaks during the hot summer months with market prices also peaking at that time In other areas power demand peaks during the winter As a result overall operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis In addition AEP has historically sold less power and consequently earned less income when weather conditions are milder Unusually mild weather in the future could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition In addition unusually extreme weather conditions could impact AEPs results of operations in a manner that would not likely be sustainable Further deteriorating economic conditions triggered by any cause including international tariffs generally result in reduced consumption by customers particularly industrial customers who may curtail operations or cease production entirely while an expanding economic environment generally results in increased revenues As a result prevailing economic conditions may reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition Volatility in the securities markets interest rates and other factors could substantially increase defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan costs and the costs of nuclear decommissioning Applies to all Registrants and to AEP and IM with respect to the costs of nuclear decommissioning The costs of providing pension and other postretirement benefit plans are dependent on a number of factors such as the rates of return on plan assets discount rates the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plan changes in actuarial assumptions future government regulation changes in life expectancy and the frequency and amount of AEPs required or voluntary contributions made to the plans Changes in actuarial assumptions and differences between the assumptions and actual values as well as a significant decline in the value of investments that fund the pension and other postretirement plans if not offset or mitigated by a decline in plan liabilities could increase pension and other postretirement expense and AEP could be required from time to time to fund the pension plan with significant amounts of cash Such cash funding obligations could have a material impact on liquidity by reducing cash flows and could negatively affect results of operations 40 Additionally IM holds a significant amount of assets in its nuclear decommissioning trusts to satisfy obligations to decommission its nuclear plant The rate of return on assets held in those trusts can significantly impact both the costs of decommissioning and the funding requirements for the trusts AEPs results of operations and cash flows may be negatively affected by a lack of growth or slower growth in the number of customers or decline in customer demand Applies to all Registrants Growth in customer accounts and growth of customer usage each directly influence demand for electricity and the need for additional power generation and delivery facilities Customer growth and customer usage are affected by a number of factors outside the control of AEP such as mandated energy efficiency measures demandside management goals distributed generation resources and economic and demographic conditions such as population changes job and income growth housing starts new business formation and the overall level of economic activity Certain regulatory and legislative bodies have introduced or are considering requirements andor incentives to further reduce energy consumption Additionally technological advances or other improvements in or applications of technology could lead to declines in per capita energy consumption Some or all of these factors could impact the demand for electricity Failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could harm results of operations Applies to all Registrants Certain events such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements mismatch of skillset or complement to future needs or unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges and increased costs The challenges include lack of resources loss of knowledge and a lengthy time period associated with skill development In this case costs including costs for contractors to replace employees productivity costs and safety costs may rise Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate the business If AEP is unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce future net income and cash flows may be reduced Changes in the price of commodities the cost of procuring fuel emission allowances for criteria pollutants and the costs of transport may increase AEPs cost of producing power impacting financial performance Applies to all Registrants except AEP Texas AEPTCo and OPCo AEP is exposed to changes in the price and availability of fuel including the cost to procure coal and gas and the price and availability to transport fuel AEP has existing contracts of varying durations for the supply of fuel but as these contracts end or if they are not honored AEP may not be able to purchase fuel on terms as favorable as the current contracts The inability to procure fuel at costs that are economical could cause AEP to retire generating capacity prior to the end of its useful life and while AEP typically recovers expenditures for undepreciated plant balances there can be no assurance in the future that AEP will recover such costs Similarly AEP is exposed to changes in the price and availability of emission allowances AEP uses emission allowances based on the amount of fuel used and reductions achieved through emission controls and other measures Based on current environmental programs remaining in effect AEP has sufficient emission allowances to cover the majority of the projected needs for the next two years and beyond If the Federal EPA attempts to further reduce interstate transport and it is acceptable by the courts additional costs may be incurred either to acquire additional allowances or to achieve further reductions in emissions If AEP needs to obtain allowances those purchases may not be on as favorable terms as those under the current environmental programs AEPs risks relative to the price and availability to transport coal include the volatility of the price of diesel which is the primary fuel used in transporting coal by barge Prices for coal natural gas and emission allowances have shown material swings in the past Changes in the cost of fuel emission allowances or natural gas and changes in the relationship between such costs and the market prices of power could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition 41 In addition actual power prices and fuel costs will differ from those assumed in financial projections used to value trading and marketing transactions and those differences may be material As a result as those transactions are markedtomarket they may impact future results of operations and cash flows and impact financial condition AEP is subject to physical and financial risks associated with climate change Applies to all Registrants Climate change creates physical and financial risk Physical risks from climate change may include an increase in sea level and changes in weather conditions such as changes in precipitation and extreme weather events such as fires Customers energy needs vary with weather conditions primarily temperature and humidity For residential customers heating and cooling represent their largest energy use To the extent weather conditions are affected by climate change customers energy use could increase or decrease depending on the duration and magnitude of the changes Increased energy use due to weather changes may require AEP to invest in additional generating assets transmission and other infrastructure to serve increased load Decreased energy use due to weather changes may affect financial condition through decreased revenues Extreme weather conditions in general require more system backup adding to costs and can contribute to increased system stress including service interruptions Weather conditions outside of the AEP service territory could also have an impact on revenues AEP buys and sells electricity depending upon system needs and market opportunities Extreme weather conditions creating high energy demand on AEPs own andor other systems may raise electricity prices as AEP buys shortterm energy to serve AEPs own system which would increase the cost of energy AEP provides to customers Severe weather and weatherrelated events impact AEPs service territories primarily when thunderstorms tornadoes hurricanes fires floods and snow or ice storms occur To the extent the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events and storms increase AEPs cost of providing service will increase including the costs and the availability of procuring insurance related to such impacts and these costs may not be recoverable Changes in precipitation resulting in droughts water shortages or floods could adversely affect operations principally the fossil fuel generating units A negative impact to water supplies due to longterm drought conditions or severe flooding could adversely impact AEPs ability to provide electricity to customers as well as increase the price they pay for energy AEP may not recover all costs related to mitigating these physical and financial risks To the extent climate change impacts a regions economic health it may also impact revenues AEPs financial performance is tied to the health of the regional economies AEP serves The price of energy as a factor in a regions cost of living as well as an important input into the cost of goods and services has an impact on the economic health of the communities within the AEP System Management cannot predict the outcome of the legal proceedings relating to AEPs business activities Applies to all Registrants AEP is involved in legal proceedings claims and litigation arising out of its business operations the most significant of which are summarized in Note 6  Commitments Guarantees and Contingencies included in the 2020 Annual Report Adverse outcomes in these proceedings could require significant expenditures that could reduce future net income and cash flows and negatively impact financial condition Disruptions at power generation facilities owned by thirdparties could interrupt the sales of transmission and distribution services Applies to AEP and AEP Texas AEP Texas transmits and distributes electric power that the REPs obtain from power generation facilities owned by thirdparties If power generation is disrupted or if power generation capacity is inadequate sales of transmission and distribution services may be diminished or interrupted and results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 42 Management is unable to predict the course results or impact if any of current or future litigation or investigations relating to the extreme winter weather in Texas in February 2021 Applies to AEP and AEP Texas As a result of the February 2021 severe winter weather in Texas which caused a shortage of electric generation ERCOT instructed AEP Texas and other Texas electric utilities to initiate power outages to avoid a sustained largescale outage and prevent longterm damage to the electric system At its peak approximately 468000 44 AEP Texas customers were without power In February 2021 a lawsuit was filed in Nueces Texas County Court against AEP and AEP Texas alleging the failure to exercise reasonable care in maintaining and updating its generation transmission and distribution facilities in order to prevent cold weather failures and other related negligence The complaint seeks monetary damages among other forms of relief In February 2021 AEP Texas received a Civil Investigative Demand from the Office of the Attorney General of Texas requesting among other data information about its communications to and from ERCOT PUCT retail electric providers utilities or power generation companies concerning power outages related to the February 2021 winter storm The company intends to respond to the Civil Investigative Demand Management is unable to predict the course or outcome of these or any future litigation or investigations or their impact if any on future results of operations financial condition and cash flows Hazards associated with highvoltage electricity transmission may result in suspension of AEPs operations or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties Applies to all Registrants AEP operations are subject to the usual hazards associated with highvoltage electricity transmission including explosions fires inclement weather natural disasters mechanical failure unscheduled downtime equipment interruptions remediation chemical spills discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases and other environmental risks The hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental damage and may result in suspension of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties AEP maintains property and casualty insurance but AEP is not fully insured against all potential hazards incident to AEPs business such as damage to poles towers and lines or losses caused by outages AEPTCo depends on its affiliates in the AEP System for a substantial portion of its revenues Applies to AEPTCo AEPTCos principal transmission service customers are its affiliates in the AEP System Management expects that these affiliates will continue to be AEPTCos principal transmission service customers for the foreseeable future For the year ended December 31 2020 its affiliates were responsible for approximately 78 of the consolidated transmission revenues of AEPTCo Most of the real property rights on which the assets of AEPTCo are situated result from affiliate license agreements and are dependent on the terms of the underlying easements and other rights of its affiliates Applies to AEPTCo AEPTCo does not hold title to the majority of real property on which its electric transmission assets are located Instead under the provisions of certain affiliate contracts it is permitted to occupy and maintain its facilities upon real property held by the respective AEP System utility affiliate that overlay its operations The ability of AEPTCo to continue to occupy such real property is dependent upon the terms of such affiliate contracts and upon the underlying real property rights of these utility affiliates which may be encumbered by easements mineral rights and other similar encumbrances that may affect the use of such real property AEP can give no assurance that a the 43 relevant AEP System utility affiliates will continue to be affiliates of AEPTCo b suitable replacement arrangements can be obtained in the event that the relevant AEP System utility affiliates are not its affiliates and c the underlying easements and other rights are sufficient to permit AEPTCo to operate its assets in a manner free from interruption RISKS RELATED TO OWNING AND OPERATING GENERATION ASSETS AND SELLING POWER Costs of compliance with existing environmental laws are significant Applies to all Registrants except AEP Texas AEPTCo and OPCo Operations are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental statutes rules and regulations relating to air quality water quality waste management natural resources and health and safety A majority of the electricity generated by the AEP System is produced by the combustion of fossil fuels Emissions of nitrogen and sulfur oxides mercury and particulates and the discharge and disposal of solid waste including coalcombustion residuals or CCR resulting from fossil fueled generation plants are subject to increased regulations controls and mitigation expenses Compliance with these legal requirements requires AEP to commit significant capital toward environmental monitoring installation of pollution control equipment emission fees disposal and permits at AEP facilities and could cause AEP to retire generating capacity prior to the end of its estimated useful life Costs of compliance with environmental statutes and regulations could reduce future net income and negatively impact financial condition especially if emission CCR waste andor discharge obligations are tightened more extensive operating andor permitting requirements are imposed or additional substances become regulated Although AEP typically recovers expenditures for pollution control technologies replacement generation undepreciated plant balances and associated operating costs from customers there can be no assurance in the future that AEP will recover the remaining costs associated with such plants Failure to recover these costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm financial condition Regulation of CO 2 emissions could materially increase costs to AEP and its customers or cause some electric generating units to be uneconomical to operate or maintain Applies to all Registrants except AEP Texas AEPTCo and OPCo In 2014 the Federal EPA issued standards for new modified and reconstructed units and a guideline for the development of SIPs that would reduce carbon CO 2 emissions from existing utility units the Clean Power Plan In 2019 the Federal EPA repealed the Clean Power Plan and replaced it with new guidelines called the Affordable Clean Energy ACE rule In January 2021 the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated the ACE Rule and remanded it to the Federal EPA The new administration has announced addressing climate change as a policy priority Costs of compliance with the environmental regulation of CO 2 emissions if any could reduce future net income and negatively impact financial condition andor could cause AEP to retire generating capacity prior to the end of its estimated useful life Although AEP typically recovers environmental expenditures there can be no assurance in the future that AEP can recover such costs which could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm financial condition Courts adjudicating nuisance and other similar claims in the future may order AEP to pay damages or to limit or reduce emissions Applies to all Registrants except AEP Texas AEPTCo and OPCo In the past there have been several cases seeking damages based on allegations of federal and state common law nuisance in which AEP among others were defendants In general the actions allege that emissions from the defendants power plants constitute a public nuisance The plaintiffs in these actions generally seek recovery of damages and other relief If future actions are resolved against AEP substantial modifications or retirement of AEPs existing coalfired power plants could be required and AEP might be required to purchase power from thirdparties to fulfill AEPs commitments to supply power to AEP customers This could have a material impact on revenues In addition AEP could be required to invest significantly in additional emission control equipment accelerate the timing of capital expenditures pay damages or penalties andor halt operations Unless recovered those costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and harm financial condition Moreover results of operations and financial position could be reduced due to the timing of recovery of these investments and the expense of ongoing litigation 44 Commodity trading and marketing activities are subject to inherent risks which can be reduced and controlled but not eliminated Applies to all Registrants except AEP Texas AEPTCo and OPCo AEP routinely has open trading positions in the market within guidelines set by AEP resulting from the management of AEPs trading portfolio To the extent open trading positions exist fluctuating commodity prices can improve or diminish financial results and financial position AEPs power trading activities also expose AEP to risks of commodity price movements To the extent that AEPs power trading does not hedge the price risk associated with the generation it owns or controls AEP would be exposed to the risk of rising and falling spot market prices In connection with these trading activities AEP routinely enters into financial contracts including futures and options OTC options financiallysettled swaps and other derivative contracts These activities expose AEP to risks from price movements If the values of the financial contracts change in a manner AEP does not anticipate it could harm financial position or reduce the financial contribution of trading operations Parties with whom AEP has contracts may fail to perform their obligations which could harm AEPs results of operations Applies to all Registrants AEP sells power from its generation facilities into the spot market and other competitive power markets on a contractual basis AEP also enters into contracts to purchase and sell electricity natural gas emission allowances and coal as part of its power marketing and energy trading operations AEP is exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe AEP money or the delivery of a commodity including power could breach their obligations Should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform AEP may be forced to enter into alternative hedging arrangements or honor underlying commitments at thencurrent market prices that may exceed AEPs contractual prices which would cause financial results to be diminished and AEP might incur losses Although estimates take into account the expected probability of default by a counterparty actual exposure to a default by a counterparty may be greater than the estimates predict AEP relies on electric transmission facilities that AEP does not own or control If these facilities do not provide AEP with adequate transmission capacity AEP may not be able to deliver wholesale electric power to the purchasers of AEPs power Applies to all Registrants AEP depends on transmission facilities owned and operated by other nonaffiliated power companies to deliver the power AEP sells at wholesale This dependence exposes AEP to a variety of risks If transmission is disrupted or transmission capacity is inadequate AEP may not be able to sell and deliver AEP wholesale power If a regions power transmission infrastructure is inadequate AEPs recovery of wholesale costs and profits may be limited If restrictive transmission price regulation is imposed the transmission companies may not have sufficient incentive to invest in expansion of transmission infrastructure The FERC has issued electric transmission initiatives that require electric transmission services to be offered unbundled from commodity sales Although these initiatives are designed to encourage wholesale market transactions access to transmission systems may not be available if transmission capacity is insufficient because of physical constraints or because it is contractually unavailable Management also cannot predict whether transmission facilities will be expanded in specific markets to accommodate competitive access to those markets 45 OVEC may require additional liquidity and other capital support Applies to AEP APCo IM and OPCo AEP and several nonaffiliated utility companies including Energy Harbor formerly FirstEnergy Solutions a nonaffiliated party own OVEC The InterCompany Power Agreement ICPA defines the rights and obligations and sets the power participation ratio of the parties to it Under the ICPA parties are entitled to receive and are obligated to pay for all OVEC capacity approximately 2400 MWs in proportion to their respective power participation ratios The aggregate power participation ratio of APCo IM and OPCo is 4347 If a party fails to make payments owed by it under the ICPA OVEC may not have sufficient funds to honor its payment obligations including its ongoing operating expenses as well as its indebtedness As of December 31 2020 OVEC has outstanding indebtedness of approximately 13 billion of which APCo IM and OPCo are collectively responsible for 555 million through the ICPA Although they are not an obligor or guarantor APCo IM and OPCo are responsible for their respective ratio of OVECs outstanding debt through the ICPA The aggregate power participation ratio of Energy Harbor under the ICPA is 485 A portion of Energy Harbors revenues includes amounts authorized under HB 6 The PUCO has rescinded its prior authorization of certain HB 6 related recovery for eligible entities including Energy Harbor If these amounts are not collected or if HB 6 is repealed and not replaced Energy Harbors financial ability to participate in the ICPA could be adversely impacted Management is currently unable to predict the outcome of the issues related to HB 6 and will continue to monitor the regulatory and legislative process and any potential impact to OVECs cash flows or financial condition If OVEC does not have sufficient funds to honor its payment obligations there is risk that APCo IM andor OPCo may need to make payments in addition to their power participation ratio payments Further if OVECs indebtedness is accelerated for any reason there is risk that APCo IM andor OPCo may be required to pay some or all of such accelerated indebtedness in amounts equal to their aggregate power participation ratio of 4347 ITEM 1B UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

Transource Missouri 167 Transource West Virginia 24 Total Circuit Miles 4995 TITLE TO PROPERTY The AEP Systems generating facilities are generally located on lands owned in fee simple The greater portion of the transmission and distribution lines of the AEP System has been constructed over lands of private owners pursuant to easements or along public highways and streets pursuant to appropriate statutory authority The rights of AEPs public utility subsidiaries in the realty on which their facilities are located are considered adequate for use in the conduct of their business Minor defects and irregularities customarily found in title to properties of like size and character may exist but such defects and irregularities do not materially impair the use of the properties AEPs public utility subsidiaries generally have the right of eminent domain which permits them if necessary to acquire perfect or secure titles to or easements on privately held lands used or to be used in their utility operations Legislation in Ohio and Virginia has restricted the right of eminent domain previously granted for power generation purposes SYSTEM TRANSMISSION LINES AND FACILITY SITING Laws in the states of Arkansas Indiana Kentucky Louisiana Michigan Ohio Tennessee Texas Virginia and West Virginia require prior approval of sites of generating facilities andor routes of highvoltage transmission lines AEP has experienced delays and additional costs in constructing facilities as a result of proceedings conducted pursuant to such statutes and in proceedings in which AEPs operating companies have sought to acquire rightsofway through condemnation These proceedings may result in additional delays and costs in future years CONSTRUCTION PROGRAM With input from its state utility commissions the AEP System continuously assesses the adequacy of its transmission distribution generation and other facilities to plan and provide for the reliable supply of electric power and energy to its customers In this assessment process assumptions are continually being reviewed as new information becomes available and assessments and plans are modified as appropriate AEP forecasts approximately 75 billion of construction expenditures for 2021 Estimated construction expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints environmental regulations business opportunities market volatility economic trends weather legal reviews and the ability to access capital See the Budgeted Capital Expenditures section of Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the 2020 Annual Report for additional information 51 POTENTIAL UNINSURED LOSSES Some potential losses or liabilities may not be insurable or the amount of insurance carried may not be sufficient to meet potential losses and liabilities including liabilities relating to damage to AEPs generation plants and costs of replacement power Unless allowed to be recovered through rates future losses or liabilities which are not completely insured could reduce net income and impact the financial conditions of AEP and other AEP System companies For risks related to owning a nuclear generating unit see the Nuclear Contingencies section of Note 6  Commitments Guarantees and Contingencies included in the 2020 Annual Report for additional information ITEM 3 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS For a discussion of material legal proceedings see Note 6  Commitments Guarantees and Contingencies
