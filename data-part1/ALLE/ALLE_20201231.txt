Northern Hemisphere our security product sales related to those projects are typically higher in those quarters than in the first and fourth calendar quarters However certain other businesses typically experience higher sales in the fourth calendar quarter due to project timing In 2020 we experienced lower sales volumes during the second quarter principally due to the economic challenges stemming from the COVID19 pandemic which were most pronounced during this quarter This is not anticipated to be a longterm trend in the seasonality of our businesses Net revenues by quarter for the years ended December 31 2020 2019 and 2018 were as follows First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter 2020 25 21 27 27 2019 23 26 26 25 2018 22 26 26 26 11 Table of Contents Human

we currently utilize based upon enhanced technology and regulatory changes We are sometimes a party to environmental lawsuits and claims and have from time to time received notices of potential violations of environmental laws and regulations from the US Environmental Protection Agency the EPA and similar state authorities We have also been identified as a potentially responsible party PRP for cleanup costs associated with offsite waste disposal at federal Superfund and state remediation sites For all such sites there are other PRPs and in most instances our involvement is minimal In estimating our liability we have assumed that we will not bear the entire cost of remediation of any site to the exclusion of other PRPs who may be jointly and severally liable The ability of other PRPs to participate has been taken into account based on our understanding of the parties financial condition and probable contributions on a per site basis Additional lawsuits and claims involving environmental matters are likely to arise from time to time in the future For a further discussion of our potential environmental liabilities see Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements Available Information We are required to file annual quarterly and current reports proxy statements and other documents with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 The SEC maintains an

the SEC The contents of our website are not incorporated by reference in this report 15 Table of Contents Item 1A RISK FACTORS We discuss our expectations regarding future performance events and outcomes in this Form 10K quarterly and annual reports press releases and other written and oral communications All statements except for historical and present factual information are forwardlooking statements and are based on financial data and business plans available only as of the time the statements are made which may become outdated or incomplete Forwardlooking statements are inherently uncertain and investors must recognize that events could significantly differ from our expectations You should carefully consider the risk factors discussed below together with all the other information included in this Form 10K in evaluating us our ordinary shares and our senior notes If any of the risks below actually occurs our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected Any such adverse effect may cause the trading price of our ordinary shares to decline and as a result you could lose all or part of your investment in us Our business may also be adversely affected by risks and uncertainties not known to us or risks that we currently believe to be immaterial We assume no obligation to update any forwardlooking statements as a result of new information future events or other factors Strategic and Operational Risks Our normal business operations have been and are expected to continue to be adversely impacted by the global COVID19 pandemic The COVID19 outbreak which was declared by the WHO as a pandemic in March 2020 and preventative measures taken to contain or mitigate this pandemic have caused and are continuing to cause business slowdowns or shutdowns in various regions around the world This pandemic has also caused and may continue to cause disruption to our global supply chain and business operations in addition to the various effects noted elsewhere within the risk factors contained in this Annual Report on Form 10K Actions taken to help limit the spread of COVID19 such as general public health decrees or other government mandates to restrict business activities and travel avoid large gatherings or to selfquarantine have impacted and will likely continue to impact our ability to carry out business as usual including the temporary suspension of some of our operations shortages in materials reduction in customer demand increased absenteeism costs associated with operational changes and an extended period of remote work arrangements for some of our employees which could increase cybersecurity risks and other operational risks Conversely as governments ease their restrictions and social interactions increase prior to the development and distribution of an effective vaccine or treatments for COVID19 preventative and precautionary measures may not be sufficient to mitigate the risk of increased infection and could result in increased illness among our employees business partners and others and lead to further business interruption In addition a significant number of our customers suppliers vendors and other business partners have been adversely affected by the COVID19 pandemic While we cannot predict the impact that this pandemic will continue to have on our customers suppliers vendors and other business partners and each of their financial conditions any material adverse effects on these parties could adversely impact us The global economic uncertainty due to this pandemic has also negatively impacted and may continue to adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition For example this pandemic has led to changes in commercial real estate occupancy increases in workfromhome arrangements constraints on government and institutional budgets and an uncertain business climate which have all contributed to declines and delays in new construction and renovation activity during 2020 including in many of the commercial and institutional construction markets we serve These challenges may be significant and continue beyond the COVID19 pandemic and the rate and sustainability of future growth remains uncertain as the longterm impacts of the pandemic and related market disruption are not yet known Additionally as a result of the global economic disruption and uncertainty due to the COVID19 pandemic interim impairment tests were performed on select goodwill and indefinitelived trade name assets in the first quarter of 2020 resulting in impairment charges of approximately 963 million If the ongoing economic impact of the COVID19 pandemic proves to be more severe than estimated the economic recovery takes longer to materialize or does not materialize as strongly as anticipated this could result in further impairment charges in the future Despite our efforts to manage and mitigate these impacts to the Company their ultimate impact also depends on factors beyond our knowledge or control including the duration and severity of this pandemic thirdparty actions taken to contain its spread and mitigate its public health effects the development distribution and acceptance of an effective vaccine and the pace of global economic recovery following containment of the spread The impact of the COVID19 pandemic continues to evolve and its ultimate impact on our business is highly uncertain and difficult to predict The continued spread of COVID19 may have further adverse impacts on our business operations customer demand supply chain cash flow generation financial position and liquidity and may also exacerbate other risks and uncertainties described in this Annual Report on Form 10K Further our management is focused on mitigating the impacts of COVID19 which has required and will continue to require a large investment of time and resources which may divert attention and resources from other business matters 16 Table of Contents Increased competition including from technological developments could adversely affect our business The markets in which we operate include a large number of participants including multinational regional and small local companies We primarily compete on the basis of quality innovation expertise effective channels to market breadth of product offering and price We may be unable to effectively compete on all these bases Further in a number of our product offerings we compete with our retail customers and technology partners who use their own private labels If we are unable to anticipate evolving trends in the market or the timing and scale of our competitors activities and initiatives including increased competition from private label brands the demand for our products and services could be negatively impacted In addition we compete in an industry that is experiencing the convergence of mechanical electronic and digital products Technology and innovation play significant roles in the competitive landscape Our success depends in part upon the research development and implementation of new technologies and products including obtaining maintaining and enforcing necessary intellectual property protections Securing and maintaining key partnerships and alliances recruiting and retaining highly skilled and qualified employee talent and having access to technologies services intellectual property and solutions developed by others will play a significant role in our ability to effectively compete The continual development of new technologies by existing and new competitors including nontraditional competitors with significant resources could adversely affect our ability to sustain operating margins and desirable levels of sales volumes To remain competitive we must develop new products and respond to new technologies in a timely manner Our growth is dependent in part on the development commercialization and acceptance of new products and services We must develop and commercialize new products and services that meet the varied and evolving needs of our customers and endusers in order to remain competitive in our current and future markets and in order to continue to grow our business The speed of development by our competitors and new market entrants is increasing We cannot provide any assurance that any new product or service will be successfully commercialized in a timely manner if ever or if commercialized will result in returns greater than our investment Investment in a product or service could divert our attention and resources from other projects that become more commercially viable in the market We also cannot provide any assurance that any new product or service will be accepted by the market Changes in customer and consumer preferences and the inability to maintain beneficial relationships with large customers could adversely affect our business We have significant customers particularly major retailers although no one customer represented 10 or more of our total Net revenues in any of the past three fiscal years The loss or material reduction of business the lack of success of sales initiatives or changes in customer preferences or loyalties for our products related to any such significant customer could have a material adverse impact on our business In addition major customers who are volume purchasers are much larger than us and have strong bargaining power with suppliers This limits our ability to recover cost increases through higher selling prices Furthermore unanticipated inventory adjustments by these customers can have a negative impact on sales We also sell our products through various trade channels including traditional retail and ecommerce channels If we or our major customers are not successful in navigating the shifting consumer preferences to distribution channels such as ecommerce our expected future revenues may be negatively impacted If our products or solutions fail to meet certification and specification requirements are defective or otherwise fall short of endusers needs and expectations our business may be negatively impacted The security and access control product markets we serve often have unique certification and specification requirements reflecting local regulatory requirements and highly variable enduser needs While we strive to meet all certification and specification requirements if any of our products or solutions do not meet such requirements or contain or are perceived to contain defects or otherwise fall short of endusers needs and expectations we may incur significant costs and our business results of operations or financial condition may be negatively impacted Additionally as endusers have continued to adopt newer technologies in their facilities and homes accelerated by the increasing adoption of IoT technologies growth in sales of electronic security products and solutions are expected to outperform growth in sales of mechanical security products Electronic security products and solutions are increasingly more sophisticated and technologically complex than the mechanical security products we sell and have an increased risk of design or manufacturing defects which could lead to product liability claims recalls product replacements or modifications writeoffs 17 Table of Contents of inventory or other assets and significant warranty and other expenses Product quality issues can also adversely affect the enduser experience resulting in reputational harm loss of competitive advantage poor market acceptance reduced demand for products and solutions delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales Further adverse publicity whether or not justified or allegations of product or service quality issues even if false or unfounded could damage our reputation and negatively affect our sales Our business and innovation strategies include making acquisitions of and investments in external companies These acquisitions and investments could be unsuccessful or consume significant resources which could adversely affect our operating and financial results We will continue to analyze and evaluate the acquisition of strategic businesses or product lines with the potential to strengthen our industry position or enhance our existing set of products and services offerings We cannot provide assurance that we will identify or successfully complete acquisitions with suitable candidates in the future nor can we provide assurance that completed acquisitions will be successful including efficient integration and creation of synergies Some of the businesses we may seek to acquire may be marginally profitable or unprofitable For these businesses to achieve acceptable levels of profitability we must improve their management operations products and market penetration We may not be successful in this regard and we may encounter other difficulties in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations Acquisitions may involve significant cash expenditures debt incurrence operating losses and expenses Acquisitions also involve numerous other risks including  Diversion of managements time and attention from daily operations  Difficulties integrating acquired businesses technologies and personnel into our business  Difficulties completing the transaction in a timely manner  Difficulties realizing synergies expected to result from acquisitions  Difficulties in obtaining and verifying the financial statements and other business information of acquired businesses  Inability to obtain regulatory approvals andor required financing on favorable terms  Potential loss of key employees key contractual relationships or key customers of acquired companies or of us  Difficulties competing in the new markets we enter  Assumption of the liabilities and exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies  Dilution of interests of holders of our ordinary shares through the issuance of equity securities or equitylinked securities and  Difficulty in integrating financial reporting systems and implementing controls procedures and policies including disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting appropriate for public companies of our size at companies that prior to the acquisition had lacked such controls procedures and policies Further as part of our innovation strategy from time to time we invest in startup companies andor development stage technology or other companies In evaluating these opportunities we follow a structured evaluation process that considers factors such as potential financial returns new expertise in emerging technology and business benefits Despite our best efforts to calculate potential return and risk some or all of these companies we invest in may be unprofitable at the time of and subsequent to our investment We may lose money in these investments including the potential for future impairment charges on the investments and the anticipated benefits of the technology and business relationships may be less than expected We continually look to expand our services and products into new international markets and as we do we will have only limited experience in marketing and operating services and products in such markets In some instances we may rely on the efforts and abilities of thirdparty and foreign business partners in such markets Certain international markets may be slower than our established markets in adopting our services and products and our operations in such markets may not develop at a rate that supports our level of investment In addition to the risks outlined above expansion into certain new markets may require us to compete with local businesses with greater knowledge of the market including the tastes and preferences of endusers and businesses with dominant market shares Any acquisitions or investments may ultimately not be successful may harm our business or financial condition andor result in impairment charges We may pursue business opportunities that diverge from our core business We may pursue business opportunities that diverge from our core business including expanding our products or service offerings investing in new and unproven technologies and forming new alliances with companies to distribute our products and services We can offer no assurance that any such business opportunities will prove successful Among other negative effects 18 Table of Contents our investment in new business opportunities may exceed the returns we realize Additionally any new investments could have higher cost structures than our current business which could reduce operating margins and require more working capital In the event that working capital requirements exceed operating cash flow we may be required to draw on our revolving credit facility or pursue other external financing which may not be readily available Our enterprise excellence efforts may not achieve the improvements we expect We utilize a number of tools to improve efficiency and productivity Implementation of new processes to our operations could cause disruptions and may prove to be more difficult costly or time consuming than expected There is no assurance that all of our planned enterprise excellence projects will be fully implemented or if implemented will realize the expected improvements We may not be able to effectively manage and implement restructuring initiatives or other organizational changes We have from time to time restructured or made other adjustments to our workforce and manufacturing footprint in response to market or product changes performance issues changes in strategy acquisitions andor other internal and external considerations For example we recently announced that effective January 1 2021 our EMEA and Asia Pacific operating segments would be combined to form the new Allegion International segment These restructuring activities and other organizational changes often result in increased restructuring costs diversion of managements time and attention from daily operations and temporarily reduced productivity If we are unable to successfully manage and implement these and other organizational changes we may not achieve or sustain the expected growth or cost savings benefits of these activities or do so within the expected timeframe These effects could recur in connection with future acquisitions and other organizational changes and our Net revenues and other results of operations could be negatively affected Disruptions in our global supply chain including product manufacturing and logistical services provided by supplier partners may negatively impact our business Our ability to meet our customers needs and achieve cost targets depends on our ability to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements including execution of supply chain optimizations and certain sole supplier or sole manufacturing arrangements The loss or disruption of such manufacturing and supply arrangements could interrupt product supply and if not effectively managed and remedied have an adverse impact on our business We procure certain products components and logistical services from supplier partners located throughout the world Our reliance on these third parties reduces our control over the manufacturing and delivery process exposing us to risks including reduced control over quality assurance product costs product supply and delivery delays If we are unable to effectively manage these relationships or if these third parties experience delays disruptions capacity constraints regulatory issues or quality control problems in their operations or otherwise fail to meet our future requirements for timely delivery our ability to ship and deliver certain of our products to our customers could be impaired and our business could be harmed The effects of global climate change or other unexpected events including global health crises may disrupt our operations and have a negative impact on our business The effects of global climate change such as extreme weather conditions and natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects or the occurrence of unexpected events including wildfires tornadoes hurricanes earthquakes floods tsunamis and other severe hazards or global health crises such as the outbreak of Ebola or the global COVID19 pandemic or other actual or threatened epidemic pandemic outbreak and spread of a communicable disease or virus in the countries where we operate or sell products and provide services could adversely affect our operations and financial performance Extreme weather natural disasters power outages global health crises or other unexpected events could disrupt our operations by impacting the availability and cost of materials needed for manufacturing causing physical damage and partial or complete closure of our manufacturing sites or distribution centers loss of human capital temporary or longterm disruption in the manufacturing and supply of products and services and disruption in our ability to deliver products and services to customers These events and disruptions could also adversely affect our customers and suppliers financial condition or ability to operate resulting in reduced customer demand delays in payments received or supply chain disruptions Further these events and disruptions could increase insurance and other operating costs including impacting our decisions regarding construction of new facilities to select areas less prone to climate change risks and natural disasters which could result in indirect financial risks passed through the supply chain or other price modifications to our products and services In particular the ultimate extent of the impact of any epidemic pandemic or other global health crisis on our business financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted 19 Table of Contents including new information that may emerge concerning the duration and severity of such epidemic pandemic or other global health crisis actions taken to contain or prevent their further spread and the pace of global economic recovery following containment of the spread We may be subject to risks relating to our information technology and operational technology systems We rely extensively on information technology and operational technology systems networks and services including hardware software firmware and technological applications and platforms collectively IT Systems to manage and operate our business from endtoend including ordering and managing materials from suppliers design and development manufacturing marketing selling and shipping to customers invoicing and billing managing our banking and cash liquidity systems managing our enterprise resource planning and other accounting and financial systems and complying with regulatory legal and tax requirements There can be no assurance that our current IT Systems will function properly We have invested and will continue to invest in improving our IT Systems Some of these investments are significant and impact many important operational processes and procedures There is no assurance that any newly implemented IT Systems will improve our current systems improve our operations or yield the expected returns on the investments In addition the implementation of new IT Systems may cause disruptions in our operations and if not properly implemented and maintained negatively impact our business If our IT Systems cease to function properly or if these systems do not provide the anticipated benefits our ability to manage our operations could be impaired We currently rely on thirdparty vendors for many of the critical elements of our global information and operational technology infrastructure and their failure to provide effective support for such infrastructure could negatively impact our business and financial results We have outsourced many of the critical elements of our global information and operational technology infrastructure to thirdparty service providers in order to achieve efficiencies If such service providers do not perform or do not perform effectively we may not be able to achieve the expected efficiencies and may have to incur additional costs to address failures in providing service by the service providers Depending on the function involved such nonperformance ineffective performance or failures of service may lead to business disruptions processing inefficiencies or security breaches Disruptions or breaches of our information systems could adversely affect us Despite our implementation of cybersecurity measures which have focused on prevention mitigation resilience and recovery our network and products including access solutions may be vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks computer viruses malicious codes malware ransomware phishing social engineering denial of service hacking breakins and similar disruptions Cybersecurity attacks and intrusion efforts are continuous and evolving and in certain cases they have been successful at the most robust institutions The scope and severity of risks that cyber threats present have increased dramatically and include but are not limited to malicious software attempts to gain unauthorized access to data or premises exploiting weaknesses related to vendors or other third parties that could be exploited to attack our systems denials of service and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data Any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition as we face regulatory reputational and litigation risks resulting from potential cyber incidents as well as the potential of incurring significant remediation costs Our daily business operations also require us to collect andor retain sensitive data such as intellectual property proprietary business information and data related to customers employees suppliers and business partners within our networking infrastructure including data from individuals subject to the European Unions General Data Protection Regulation that is subject to privacy and security laws regulations andor customerimposed controls Despite our efforts to protect such data the loss or breach of such data due to various causes including material security breaches catastrophic events extreme weather natural disasters power outages system failures computer viruses improper data handling programming errors unauthorized access and employee error or malfeasance could result in wide reaching negative impacts to our business and as such the ongoing maintenance and security of this information is pertinent to the success of our business operations and our strategic goals In addition we operate in an environment where there are different and potentially conflicting data privacy laws and regulations in effect or expected to go into effect in the future including regulations related to devices connected through IoT in the various jurisdictions in which we operate and we must understand and comply with such laws and regulations while ensuring our data is secure 20 Table of Contents Our networking infrastructure and related assets may be subject to unauthorized access by hackers employee error or malfeasance or other unforeseen activities Such issues could result in the disruption of business processes network degradation and system downtime along with the potential that a third party will exploit our critical assets such as intellectual property proprietary business information and data related to our customers suppliers and business partners To the extent that such disruptions occur and our business continuity plans do not effectively address these disruptions in a timely manner they may cause delays in the manufacture or shipment of our products and the cancellation of customer orders and as a result our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected resulting in a possible loss of business or brand reputation Our ability to successfully grow and expand our business depends on our ability to recruit and retain a highly qualified and diverse workforce Our ability to successfully grow and expand our business depends on the contributions and abilities of our employees and key management including for example the ability of our sales force to adapt to any changes made in the sales organization and achieve adequate customer coverage We must therefore continue to effectively recruit retain and motivate key management sales and other highly qualified skilled and diverse personnel to maintain our current business and support our projected growth A shortage of these key employees for various reasons including changes in laws and policies regarding immigration and work authorizations in jurisdictions where we have operations might jeopardize our ability to grow and expand our business Economic Market and Financial Risks Our global operations subject us to economic risks We are incorporated in Ireland and operate in countries worldwide Our global operations depend on products manufactured purchased and sold in the US and internationally including in Australia Canada China Europe Korea Mexico New Zealand and the Middle East The political economic and regulatory environments in which we operate are becoming increasingly volatile and uncertain Accordingly we are subject to risks that are inherent in operating globally including  Changes to trade agreements sanctions import and export regulations including imposition of burdensome tariffs and quotas and customs duties  Changes in applicable tax regulations and interpretations  Economic downturns and social and political instability  Changes in laws and regulations or imposition of currency restrictions and other restraints in various jurisdictions  Limitation of ownership rights including expropriation of assets by a local government and limitation on the ability to repatriate earnings  Sovereign debt crises and currency instability in developed and developing countries  Difficulty in staffing and managing global operations  Difficulty in enforcing agreements collecting receivables and protecting assets through nonUS legal systems and  Political unrest national and international conflict including war border closures civil disturbances and terrorist acts These risks could increase our cost of doing business in the US and internationally increase our counterparty risk disrupt our operations disrupt the ability of suppliers and customers to fulfill their obligations increase our effective tax rate increase the cost of our products limit our ability to sell products in certain markets reduce our operating margin reduce cash flow and negatively impact our ability to compete Our business relies on the institutional commercial and residential construction and remodeling markets Demand for our security products and solutions relies on the institutional commercial and residential construction and remodeling markets which are marked by cyclicality based on overall economic conditions including consumer confidence and disposable income corporate and government spending workfromhome trends availability of credit and demand for new housing and infrastructure Weakness or instability in one or more of these markets may cause current and potential customers to delay or cancel major capital projects or otherwise choose not to make purchases which could negatively impact the demand for our products and solutions and erode average selling prices 21 Table of Contents Currency exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect our results We are exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in currency exchange rates See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk Approximately 30 of our 2020 Net revenues were derived outside the US and we expect sales to nonUS customers to continue to represent a significant portion of our consolidated Net revenues Although we may enter into currency exchange contracts to reduce our risk related to currency exchange fluctuations changes in the relative fair values of currencies occur from time to time and may in some instances have a material impact on our results of operations We do not hedge against all of our currency exposure and therefore our business will continue to be susceptible to currency fluctuations We also translate assets liabilities revenues and expenses denominated in nonUS dollar currencies into US dollars for our Consolidated Financial Statements based on applicable exchange rates Consequently fluctuations in the value of the US dollar compared to other currencies may have a material impact on the value of these items in our Consolidated Financial Statements even if their value has not changed in their original currency Commodity shortages price increases and higher energy prices could negatively affect our financial results We rely on suppliers to secure commodities including steel zinc brass and other nonferrous metals required for the manufacture of our products A disruption of deliveries from our suppliers or decreased availability of commodities could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs We believe that available sources of supply will generally be sufficient for our needs for the foreseeable future Nonetheless the unavailability of some commodities could have a material adverse impact on our business Volatility in the prices of these commodities could increase the costs of our products and services and we may not be able to pass on these costs to our customers We do not currently use financial derivatives to hedge against this volatility however we utilize firm purchase commitments to mitigate risk The pricing of some commodities we use is based on market prices To mitigate this exposure we may use annual price contracts to minimize the impact of inflation and to benefit from deflation Additionally we are exposed to fluctuations in energy prices due to the instability of current market prices Higher energy costs increase our operating costs and the cost of shipping our products and supplying services to our customers around the world Consequently sharp price increases the imposition of taxes or an interruption of supply could cause us to lose the ability to effectively manage the risk of rising energy prices and may have an adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows We may be required to recognize impairment charges for our goodwill indefinitelived intangible assets and other longlived assets At December 31 2020 the net carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets totaled approximately 8190 million and 1183 million respectively Pursuant to US generally accepted accounting principles GAAP we are required to annually assess our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment In addition interim assessments must be performed for these and other longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred Significant disruptions to our business or end market conditions protracted economic weakness unexpected significant declines in operating results of reporting units divestitures or market capitalization declines may result in recognition of impairment charges to our goodwill indefinitelived intangible or other longlived assets Specifically an unanticipated deterioration in Net revenues andor operating margins generated by our newly created Allegion International segment could trigger future impairments Any charges relating to such impairments could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in the periods when recognized The capital and credit markets are important to our business Instability in US and global capital and credit markets including market disruptions limited liquidity and interest rate volatility or reductions in the credit ratings assigned to us by independent ratings agencies could reduce our access to capital markets or increase the cost of funding our short and longterm credit requirements In particular if we are unable to access capital and credit markets on terms that are acceptable to us we may not be able to make certain investments or fully execute our business plans and strategy Our suppliers and customers are also dependent upon the capital and credit markets Limitations on the ability of customers suppliers or financial counterparties to access credit could lead to insolvencies of key suppliers and customers limit or prevent 22 Table of Contents customers from obtaining credit to finance purchases of our products and services and cause delays in the delivery of key products from suppliers There are risks associated with our outstanding and future indebtedness We have approximately 14 billion of outstanding indebtedness at December 31 2020 In addition we have a senior unsecured revolving credit facility the Revolving Facility that permits borrowings of up to an additional 500 million Volatility in the credit markets could adversely impact our ability to obtain favorable financing terms in the future A portion of our cash flows from operations is dedicated to servicing our indebtedness and will not be available for other purposes including our operations capital expenditures payment of dividends share repurchases or future business opportunities Our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial and operating performance which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business and other factors beyond our control If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures reduce or eliminate the payment of dividends sell assets seek additional capital or seek to restructure or refinance our indebtedness These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations In such event we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to sell material assets or operations to attempt to meet our debt service and other obligations Additionally at December 31 2020 our borrowings included a variable rate term loan facility indexed to LIBOR the Term Facility and together with the Revolving Facility the Credit Facilities with an outstanding balance of 2388 million which exposes us to variable interest rate risk We are also exposed to the risk of rising interest rates to the extent that we fund our operations with shortterm or variablerate borrowings under our Revolving Facility If LIBOR or other applicable base rates under our Credit Facilities increase in the future our Interest expense could increase Additionally the regulator that oversees LIBOR has announced that it cannot guarantee LIBORs availability after 2021 In the event LIBOR is discontinued replaced significantly changed or ceases to be recognized as an acceptable benchmark there may be uncertainty or differences in the calculation of our applicable interest rate or required payment amounts for our Credit Facilities This could also require different hedging strategies and require renegotiation of our existing Credit Facilities While we do not currently anticipate the transition from LIBOR and the risks thereto to have a material adverse effect on us it remains uncertain at this time Legal and Compliance Risks We are subject to risks related to corporate social responsibility and reputational matters Our reputation and the reputation of our brands including the perception held by our customers endusers business partners investors other key stakeholders and the communities in which we do business are influenced by various factors There is an increased focus from our stakeholders on environmental social and governance ESG practices and disclosure  and if we fail or are perceived to have failed in any number of ESG matters such as environmental stewardship inclusion and diversity workplace conduct and support for local communities our reputation or the reputation of our brands may suffer Such damage to our reputation and the reputation of our brands may negatively impact our business financial condition and results of operations In addition negative or inaccurate postings or comments on social media or networking websites about the Company or our brands could generate adverse publicity that could damage our reputation or the reputation of our brands If we are unable to effectively manage real or perceived issues including concerns about product quality safety corporate social responsibility or other matters sentiments toward the Company or our products could be negatively impacted and our financial results could suffer Our brands are important assets of our businesses and violation of our trademark rights by imitators could negatively impact revenues and brand reputation Our brands and trademarks enjoy a reputation for quality and value and are important to our success and competitive position Unauthorized use of our trademarks may not only erode sales of our products but may also cause significant damage to our brand name and reputation interfere with relationships with our customers and increase litigation costs There can be no assurance that our ongoing effort to protect our brand and trademark rights will prevent all violations 23 Table of Contents Material adverse legal judgments fines penalties or settlements could adversely affect our business We are currently and may in the future become involved in legal proceedings and disputes incidental to the operation of our business Our business may be adversely affected by the outcome of these proceedings and other contingencies including without limitation environmental product liability antitrust intellectual property data protection privacy and labor and employment matters that cannot be predicted with certainty As required by GAAP we establish reserves based on our assessment of contingencies Subsequent developments in legal proceedings and other contingencies may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a reserve and we may be required to make additional material payments Allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of third parties could negatively affect us We may be subject to claims of infringement of intellectual property rights by third parties In particular we often compete in areas having extensive intellectual property rights owned by others and we have become subject to claims alleging infringement of intellectual property rights of others In general if it is determined that one or more of our technologies products or services infringes the intellectual property rights owned by others we may be required to cease marketing those products or services to obtain licenses from the holders of the intellectual property at a material cost or to take other actions to avoid infringing such intellectual property rights The litigation process is costly and subject to inherent uncertainties and we may not prevail in litigation matters regardless of the merits of our position Adverse intellectual property litigation or claims of infringement against us may become extremely disruptive if the plaintiffs succeed in blocking the trade of our products and services and may have a material adverse effect on our business Our reputation ability to do business and results of operations could be impaired by adverse publicity or improper conduct by any of our employees agents or business partners We are subject to regulation under a variety of US federal and state and nonUS laws regulations and policies including laws related to anticorruption export and import compliance antitrust and money laundering due to our global operations We cannot provide assurance that our internal controls will always protect us from the improper conduct of our employees agents and business partners Any improper conduct could damage our reputation and subject us to among other things civil and criminal penalties material fines equitable remedies including profit disgorgement and injunctions on future conduct securities litigation and a general loss of investor confidence Our operations are subject to regulatory risks Our US and nonUS operations are subject to a number of laws and regulations including fire and building codes and environmental health and safety standards We have incurred and will be required to continue to incur significant expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations Changes to or changes in interpretations of current laws and regulations could require us to increase our compliance expenditures cause us to significantly alter or discontinue offering existing products and services or cause us to develop new products and services Altering current products and services or developing new products and services to comply with changes in the applicable laws and regulations could require significant research and development investments increase the cost of providing the products and services and adversely affect the demand for our products and services In the event a regulatory authority concludes that we are not or have not at all times been in full compliance with these laws or regulations we could be fined criminally charged or otherwise sanctioned Certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners of real property or operators of manufacturing facilities for the costs of investigation removal or remediation of hazardous substances or materials at such properties or at properties at which parties have disposed of hazardous substances Liability for investigative removal and remedial costs under certain US federal and state laws and certain nonUS laws are retroactive strict and joint and several In addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances We have received notification from US and nonUS governmental agencies including the EPA and similar state environmental agencies that conditions at a number of current and formerly owned sites where we and others have disposed of hazardous substances require investigation cleanup and other possible remedial action These agencies may require that we reimburse the government for its costs incurred at these sites or otherwise pay for the costs of investigation and cleanup of these sites including by providing compensation for natural resource damage claims from such sites For more information see Item 1 Business  Regulatory Matters While we have planned for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with environmental laws and have accrued for costs related to current remedial efforts our costs of compliance or our liabilities arising from past or future 24 Table of Contents releases of or exposures to hazardous substances may exceed our estimates We may also be subject to additional environmental claims for personal injury or cost recovery actions for remediation of facilities in the future based on our past present or future business activities As a global business we have a relatively complex tax structure and there is a risk that tax authorities will disagree with our tax positions Since we conduct operations worldwide through our subsidiaries we are subject to complex transfer pricing regulations in the countries in which we operate Transfer pricing regulations generally require that for tax purposes transactions between us and our affiliates be priced on a basis that would be comparable to an arms length transaction and that contemporaneous documentation be maintained to support the tax allocation Although uniform transfer pricing standards are emerging in many of the countries in which we operate there is still a relatively high degree of uncertainty and inherent subjectivity in complying with these rules To the extent that any tax authority disagrees with our transfer pricing policies we could become subject to significant tax liabilities and penalties Our tax returns are subject to review by taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate Although we believe that we have provided for all tax exposures the ultimate outcome of a tax review could differ materially from our provisions We could be subject to changes in tax rates the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities Our future effective tax rate and cash tax obligations could be adversely affected by shifts in our mix of earnings in countries with varying statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities or changes in tax laws regulations interpretations or accounting principles as well as certain discrete items In addition we are subject to regular review and audit by tax authorities As a result we have received and may in the future receive assessments in multiple jurisdictions on various taxrelated assertions Any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition In addition the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain Although we believe our estimates are reasonable the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made Furthermore due to shifting economic and political conditions tax policies laws interpretations and rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change which could materially affect our financial position and results of operations For example many countries in Europe as well as a number of other countries and organizations have recently proposed recommended or implemented changes to existing tax laws or have enacted new laws that could significantly increase our effective tax rate or cash tax obligations in countries where we do business or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business Risks Related to Our Incorporation in Ireland Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and may afford less protection to holders of our securities The US currently does not have a treaty with Ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters As such there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of Ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of US courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on US federal or state civil liability laws including the civil liability provisions of the US federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws As an Irish company we are governed by the Companies Act 2014 of Ireland as amended which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to US corporations and shareholders including among others differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits Likewise the duties of directors and officers of an Irish company generally are owed to the company only Shareholders of Irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances Accordingly holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the US In addition Irish law allows shareholders to authorize share capital which then can be issued by a board of directors without shareholder approval Also subject to specified exceptions Irish law grants statutory preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares for cash At our annual meeting of shareholders our shareholders authorized our Board of Directors to issue up to 33 of our issued ordinary shares and further authorized our Board of Directors to issue up to 5 of such shares for cash without first offering them to our existing shareholders Both of these authorizations will expire after a certain period unless renewed by our shareholders and we cannot guarantee that the renewal of these authorizations will always 25 Table of Contents be approved If the Directors authority to issue ordinary shares is not renewed then we may be limited in our ability to use our shares for example as consideration for acquisitions Changes in tax laws regulations or treaties changes in our status under the tax laws of many jurisdictions or adverse determinations by taxing authorities could increase our tax burden or otherwise affect our financial condition or operating results as well as subject our shareholders to additional taxes The realization of any tax benefit related to our incorporation and tax residence in Ireland could be impacted by changes in tax laws tax treaties or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof by the tax authorities of many jurisdictions From time to time proposals have been made andor legislation introduced to change the tax laws of various jurisdictions or limit tax treaty benefits that if enacted could materially increase our tax burden andor our effective tax rate Moreover other legislative proposals could have a material adverse impact on us by overriding certain tax treaties and limiting the treaty benefits on certain payments which could increase our tax liability We cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislation in any jurisdiction While we monitor proposals that would materially impact our tax burden andor our effective tax rate and investigate our options we could still be subject to increased taxation on a going forward basis no matter what action we undertake if certain proposals are enacted certain tax treaties are amended andor our interpretation of applicable tax law is challenged and determined to be incorrect In particular any changes andor differing interpretations of applicable tax law that have the effect of disregarding our incorporation in Ireland limiting our ability to take advantage of tax treaties between jurisdictions modifying or eliminating the deductibility of various currently deductible payments or increasing the tax burden of operating or being resident in a particular country could subject us to increased taxation Dividends received by our shareholders may be subject to Irish dividend withholding tax In certain circumstances we are required to deduct Irish dividend withholding tax of 25 from dividends paid to our shareholders In the majority of cases shareholders residing in the US will not be subject to Irish withholding tax and shareholders resident in a number of other countries will not be subject to Irish withholding tax provided that they complete certain Irish dividend withholding tax forms However some shareholders may be subject to withholding tax which could discourage the investment in our stock and adversely impact the price of our shares Dividends received by our shareholders may be subject to Irish income tax Dividends paid in respect of our shares generally are not subject to Irish income tax where the beneficial owner of these dividends is exempt from Irish dividend withholding tax unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with Ireland other than his or her shareholding in Allegion Our shareholders who receive their dividends subject to Irish dividend withholding tax will generally have no further liability to Irish income tax on the dividends unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with Ireland other than his or her shareholding in Allegion Certain provisions in our Memorandum and Articles of Association among other things could prevent or delay an acquisition of us which could decrease the trading price of our ordinary shares Our Memorandum and Articles of Association contains provisions to deter takeover practices inadequate takeover bids and unsolicited offers These provisions include amongst others  A provision of our Articles of Association which generally prohibits us from engaging in a business combination with an interested shareholder being i the beneficial owner directly or indirectly of 10 or more of our voting shares or ii an affiliate or associate of us that has at any time within the last five years been the beneficial owner directly or indirectly of 10 or more of our voting shares subject to certain exceptions  Rules regarding how shareholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at shareholder meetings  The right of our Board of Directors
