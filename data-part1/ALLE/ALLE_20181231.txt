residential construction markets throughout North America EMEIA and Asia Pacific In recent years as endusers adopt newer technologies in their facilities and single and multifamily homes growth in electronic security products and solutions continues to outperform growth in mechanical security products and solutions We expect the security products industry will benefit from favorable longterm demographic trends such as continued urbanization of the global population increased concerns about safety and security and technologydriven innovation The security products markets are highly competitive and fragmented throughout the world with a number of large multinational companies and thousands of smaller regional and local companies This high fragmentation primarily reflects local regulatory requirements and highly variable enduser needs We believe our principal global competitors are Assa Abloy AB and dormakaba Group We also face competition in various markets and product categories throughout the world including from Spectrum Brands Holdings Inc in the North American residential market As we move into more technologicallyadvanced product categories we may also compete against new more specialized competitors Our success depends on a variety of factors including brand and reputation product breadth integration with popular technology platforms quality and delivery capabilities price and service capabilities As many of our businesses sell through wholesale distribution our success also depends on building and partnering with a strong channel network Although price often serves as an important customer decision criterion we also compete based on the breadth and quality of our products and solutions our ability to customconfigure solutions to meet individual enduser requirements and our global supply chain Products and Services We offer an extensive and versatile portfolio of mechanical and electronic security products across a range of marketleading brands  Locks locksets portable locks and key systems and services  A broad array of cylindrical and mortise door locksets security levers and master key systems that are used to protect

marketing strategies including traditional consumer media retail merchandising digital marketing retail promotions and builder and consumer trade shows to support these teams We also work actively with several industry bodies around the world to help promote effective and consistent safety and security standards For example we are members of Builders Hardware Manufacturers Association BHMA Security Industry Association Smart Card Alliance American Society of Healthcare Engineering American Institute of Architects Construction Specification Institute ASSOFERMA Italy BHE Germany and UNIQ France Production and Distribution We manufacture our products in our geographic markets around the world We operate 34 production and assembly facilities including 16 in Americas 12 in EMEIA and 6 in Asia Pacific We own 17 of these facilities and lease the others Our strategy is to produce in the region of use wherever appropriate to allow us to be closer to the enduser and increase efficiency and timely product delivery Much of our US based residential portfolio is manufactured in the Baja region of Mexico under a NAFTA Maquiladora In managing our network of production facilities we focus on eliminating excess capacity reducing cycle time through productivity and harmonizing production practices and safety procedures We distribute our products through a broad network of channel partners In addition thirdparty manufacturing and logistics providers perform certain manufacturing storage and distribution services for us to support certain parts of our manufacturing and distribution network Raw Materials We support our regionofuse production strategy with corresponding regionofuse supplier partners where available Our global and regional commodity teams work with production leadership product management and materials management teams to ensure adequate materials are available for production We purchase a wide range of raw materials including steel zinc brass and other nonferrous metals to support our production facilities Where appropriate we may enter into fixedcost contracts to lower overall costs Intellectual Property Intellectual property inclusive of certain patents trademarks copyrights knowhow trade secrets and other proprietary rights is important to our business We create protect and enforce our intellectual property investments in a variety of ways We work actively in the US and internationally to try to ensure the protection and enforcement of our intellectual property rights We use trademarks on nearly all of our products and believe such distinctive marks are an important factor in creating a market for our goods in identifying us and in distinguishing our products from others We consider our CISA Interflex LCN Schlage SimonsVoss Von Duprin and other associated trademarks to be among our most valuable assets and we have registered these trademarks in a number of countries Although certain proprietary intellectual property rights are important to our success we do not believe we are materially dependent on any particular patent or license or any particular group of patents or licenses Facilities We operate through a broad network of sales offices engineering centers 34 production and assembly facilities and several distribution centers throughout the world Our active properties represent approximately 69 million square feet of which approximately 37 is leased The following table shows the location of our worldwide production and assembly facilities 10 Table of Contents Production and Assembly Facilities Americas

Tecate Mexico Tijuana Mexico Research and Development We are committed to investing in highly productive research and development capabilities particularly in electromechanical systems We concentrate on developing technology innovations that will deliver growth through the introduction of new products and solutions as well as driving continuous improvements in product cost quality safety and sustainability We manage our RD team as a global group with an emphasis on a global collaborative approach to identify and develop new technologies and worldwide product platforms We are organized on a regional basis to leverage expertise in local standards and configurations In addition to regional engineering centers in each geographic region we also operate a global engineering design center in Bangalore India Seasonality Our business experiences seasonality that varies by product line Because more construction and doityourself projects occur during the second and third calendar quarters of each year in the Northern Hemisphere our security product sales related to those projects are typically higher in those quarters than in the first and fourth calendar quarters However certain other businesses typically experience higher sales in the fourth calendar quarter due to project timing Net revenues by quarter for the years ended December 31 2018  2017 and 2016 are as follows First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter 2018 22 26 26 26 2017 23 26 25 26 2016 22 26 26 26 Employees As of December 31 2018 we had approximately 11000 employees Environmental Regulation We have a dedicated environmental program that is designed to reduce the utilization and generation of hazardous materials during the manufacturing process as well as to remediate identified environmental concerns As to the latter we are currently engaged in site investigations and remediation activities to address environmental cleanup from past operations at current and former production facilities We regularly evaluate our remediation programs and consider alternative remediation methods that are in addition to or in replacement of those we currently utilize based upon enhanced technology and regulatory changes 11 Table of Contents We are sometimes a party to environmental lawsuits and claims and have received notices of potential violations of environmental laws and regulations from the US Environmental Protection Agency the EPA and similar state authorities We have also been identified as a potentially responsible party PRP for cleanup costs associated with offsite waste disposal at federal Superfund and state remediation sites For all such sites there are other PRPs and in most instances our involvement is minimal In estimating our liability we have assumed that we will not bear the entire cost of remediation of any site to the exclusion of other PRPs who may be jointly and severally liable The ability of other PRPs to participate has been taken into account based on our understanding of the parties financial condition and probable contributions on a per site basis Additional lawsuits and claims involving environmental matters are likely to arise from time to time in the future We incurred  24 million   32 million and 233 million of expenses during the years ended December 31 2018  2017 and 2016  respectively for environmental remediation at sites presently or formerly owned or leased by us As of December 31 2018 and 2017  we have recorded reserves for environmental matters of  226 million and  289 million  respectively Of these amounts  63 million and  89 million  respectively relate to remediation of sites previously disposed by us Given the evolving nature of environmental laws regulations and technology the ultimate cost of future compliance is uncertain Available Information We are required to file annual quarterly and current reports proxy statements and other documents with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 The SEC maintains an Internet website that contains reports proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC The

performance events and outcomes in this Form 10K quarterly and annual reports press releases and other written and oral communications All statements except for historical and present factual information are forwardlooking statements and are based on financial data and business plans available only as of the time the statements are made which may become outdated or incomplete Forwardlooking statements are inherently uncertain and investors must recognize that events could significantly differ from our expectations You should carefully consider the risk factors discussed below together with all the other information included in this Form 10K in evaluating us our ordinary shares and our senior notes If any of the risks below actually occurs our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected Any such adverse effect may cause the trading price of our ordinary shares to decline and as a result you could lose all or part of your investment in us Our business may also be adversely affected by risks and uncertainties not known to us or risks that we currently believe to be immaterial We assume no obligation to update any forwardlooking statements as a result of new information future events or other factors Risks Related to Our Business Our global operations subject us to economic risks We are incorporated in Ireland and operate in countries worldwide Our global operations depend on products manufactured purchased and sold in the US and internationally including in Australia China Colombia Europe Korea Mexico New Zealand Turkey and the United Arab Emirates The political economic and regulatory environments in which we operate are becoming increasingly volatile and uncertain Accordingly we are subject to risks that are inherent in operating globally including  changes in laws and regulations or imposition of currency restrictions and other restraints in various jurisdictions  limitation of ownership rights including expropriation of assets by a local government and limitation on the ability to repatriate earnings  sovereign debt crises and currency instability in developed and developing countries  changes in applicable tax regulations and interpretations  changes to trade agreements sanctions import and export regulations including imposition of burdensome tariffs and quotas and customs duties  difficulty in staffing and managing global operations  difficulty in enforcing agreements collecting receivables and protecting assets through nonUS legal systems  political unrest national and international conflict including war civil disturbances and terrorist acts and  economic downturns and social and political instability These risks could increase our cost of doing business in the US and internationally increase our counterparty risk disrupt our operations disrupt the ability of suppliers and customers to fulfill their obligations increase our effective tax rate increase the cost of our products limit our ability to sell products in certain markets reduce our operating margin reduce cash flow and negatively impact our ability to compete Our business relies on the institutional commercial and residential construction and remodeling markets We primarily rely on the institutional commercial and residential construction and remodeling markets which are marked by cyclicality based on overall economic conditions Weakness or instability in these markets may cause current and potential customers to delay or choose not to make purchases which could negatively impact the demand for our products and services Increased competition including from technical developments could adversely affect our business The markets in which we operate include a large number of participants including multinational companies regional companies and small local companies We primarily compete on the basis of quality innovation expertise effective channels to market breadth of product offering and price We may be unable to effectively compete on all these bases If we are unable to anticipate evolving trends in the market or the timing and scale of our competitors activities and initiatives the demand for our products and services could be negatively impacted In addition we compete in an industry that is experiencing the convergence of mechanical electronic and digital products Technology and innovation play significant roles in the competitive landscape Our success depends in part upon the research development and implementation of new technologies and products including obtaining maintaining and enforcing necessary intellectual property protections Securing and maintaining key partnerships and alliances recruiting and retaining highly skilled and qualified employee talent and having access to technologies services intellectual property and solutions developed by others 13 Table of Contents will play a significant role in our ability to effectively compete The continual development of new technologies by existing and new competitors including nontraditional competitors with significant resources could adversely affect our ability to sustain operating margins and desirable levels of sales volumes To remain competitive we must develop new products and respond to new technologies in a timely manner Our growth is dependent in part on the development commercialization and acceptance of new products and services We must develop and commercialize new products and services in order to remain competitive in our current and future markets and in order to continue to grow our business The speed of development by our competitors and new market entrants is increasing We cannot provide any assurance that any new product or service will be successfully commercialized in a timely manner if ever or if commercialized will result in returns greater than our investment Investment in a product or service could divert our attention and resources from other projects that become more commercially viable in the market We also cannot provide any assurance that any new product or service will be accepted by the market Changes in customer preferences and the inability to maintain beneficial relationships with large customers could adversely affect our business We have significant customers particularly major retailers although no one customer represented 10 or more of our total Net revenues in any of the past three fiscal years The loss or material reduction of business the lack of success of sales initiatives or changes in customer preferences or loyalties for our products related to any such significant customer could have a material adverse impact on our business In addition major customers who are volume purchasers are much larger than us and have strong bargaining power with suppliers This limits our ability to recover cost increases through higher selling prices Furthermore unanticipated inventory adjustments by these customers can have a negative impact on sales Our brands are important assets of our businesses and violation of our trademark rights by imitators could negatively impact revenues and brand reputation Our brands and trademarks enjoy a reputation for quality and value and are important to our success and competitive position Unauthorized use of our trademarks may not only erode sales of our products but may also cause significant damage to our brand name and reputation interfere with relationships with our customers and increase litigation costs There can be no assurance that our ongoing effort to protect our brand and trademark rights will prevent all violations Currency exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect our results We are exposed to a variety of market risks including the effects of changes in currency exchange rates See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk Approximately 30 of our 2018 Net revenues were derived outside the US and we expect sales to nonUS customers to continue to represent a significant portion of our consolidated Net revenues Although we may enter into currency exchange contracts to reduce our risk related to currency exchange fluctuations changes in the relative fair values of currencies occur from time to time and may in some instances have a material impact on our results of operations We do not hedge against all of our currency exposure and therefore our business will continue to be susceptible to currency fluctuations We also translate assets liabilities revenues and expenses denominated in nonUS dollar currencies into US dollars for our Consolidated Financial Statements based on applicable exchange rates Consequently fluctuations in the value of the US dollar compared to other currencies may have a material impact on the value of these items in our Consolidated Financial Statements even if their value has not changed in their original currency Our business strategy includes making acquisitions and investments that complement our existing business These acquisitions and investments could be unsuccessful or consume significant resources which could adversely affect our operating results We will continue to analyze and evaluate the acquisition of strategic businesses or product lines with the potential to strengthen our industry position or enhance our existing set of products and services offerings We cannot provide assurance that we will identify or successfully complete transactions with suitable acquisition candidates in the future nor can we provide assurance that completed acquisitions will be successful Some of the businesses we may seek to acquire or invest in may be marginally profitable or unprofitable For these businesses to achieve acceptable levels of profitability we must improve their management operations products and market penetration We 14 Table of Contents may not be successful in this regard and we may encounter other difficulties in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations Acquisitions and investments may involve significant cash expenditures debt incurrence operating losses and expenses Acquisitions involve numerous other risks including  diversion of management time and attention from daily operations  difficulties integrating acquired businesses technologies and personnel into our business  difficulties completing the transaction in a timely manner  difficulties realizing synergies expected to result from acquisitions  difficulties in obtaining and verifying the financial statements and other business information of acquired businesses  inability to obtain regulatory approvals andor required financing on favorable terms  potential loss of key employees key contractual relationships or key customers of acquired companies or of us  difficulties competing in the new markets we enter  assumption of the liabilities and exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies  dilution of interests of holders of our ordinary shares through the issuance of equity securities or equitylinked securities and  difficulty in integrating financial reporting systems and implementing controls procedures and policies including disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting appropriate for public companies of our size at companies that prior to the acquisition had lacked such controls procedures and policies We continually look to expand our services and products into international markets As we expand into new international markets we will have only limited experience in marketing and operating services and products in such markets In some instances we may rely on the efforts and abilities of foreign business partners in such markets Certain international markets may be slower than US markets in adopting our services and products and our operations in such markets may not develop at a rate that supports our level of investment In addition to the risks outlined above expansion into certain international markets may require us to compete with local businesses with greater knowledge of the market including the tastes and preferences of customers and businesses with dominant market shares Any acquisitions or investments may ultimately harm our business or financial condition as such acquisitions may not be successful and may ultimately result in impairment charges We may pursue business opportunities that diverge from core business We may pursue business opportunities that diverge from our core business including expanding our products or service offerings investing in new and unproven technologies and forming new alliances with companies to distribute our products and services We can offer no assurance that any such business opportunities will prove to be successful Among other negative effects our investment in new business opportunities may exceed the returns we realize Additionally any new investments could have higher cost structures than our current business which could reduce operating margins and require more working capital In the event that working capital requirements exceed operating cash flow we may be required to draw on our revolving credit facility or pursue other external financing which may not be readily available Our enterprise excellence efforts may not achieve the improvements we expect We utilize a number of tools to improve efficiency and productivity Implementation of new processes to our operations could cause disruptions and may prove to be more difficult costly or time consuming than expected There is no assurance that all of our planned enterprise excellence projects will be fully implemented or if implemented will realize the expected improvements Our periodic restructuring plans may not be successful We have in the past restructured or made other adjustments to our workforce and manufacturing footprint in response to market changes product changes performance issues changes in strategy acquisitions and other internal and external considerations Historically these types of restructuring activities have resulted in increased restructuring costs and temporarily reduced productivity In addition we may not achieve or sustain the expected growth or cost savings benefits of these restructurings or do so within the expected timeframe These effects could recur in connection with future acquisitions and other restructurings and our Net revenues and other results of operations could be negatively affected Material adverse legal judgments fines penalties or settlements could adversely affect our business We are currently and may in the future become involved in legal proceedings and disputes incidental to the operation of our business Our business may be adversely affected by the outcome of these proceedings and other contingencies including without 15 Table of Contents limitation environmental product liability intellectual property data protection and labor and employment matters that cannot be predicted with certainty As required by US generally accepted accounting principles GAAP we establish reserves based on our assessment of contingencies Subsequent developments in legal proceedings and other contingencies may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a reserve and we may be required to make additional material payments Allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of third parties could negatively affect us We may be subject to claims of infringement of intellectual property rights by third parties In particular we often compete in areas having extensive intellectual property rights owned by others and we have become subject to claims alleging infringement of intellectual property rights of others In general if it is determined that one or more of our technologies products or services infringes the intellectual property rights owned by others we may be required to cease marketing those services to obtain licenses from the holders of the intellectual property at a material cost or to take other actions to avoid infringing such intellectual property rights The litigation process is costly and subject to inherent uncertainties and we may not prevail in litigation matters regardless of the merits of our position Adverse intellectual property litigation or claims of infringement against us may become extremely disruptive if the plaintiffs succeed in blocking the trade of our products and services and may have a material adverse effect on our business Our reputation ability to do business and results of operations could be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees agents or business partners We are subject to regulation under a variety of US federal and state and nonUS laws regulations and policies including laws related to anticorruption export and import compliance antitrust and money laundering due to our global operations We cannot provide assurance that our internal controls will always protect us from the improper conduct of our employees agents and business partners Any improper conduct could damage our reputation and subject us to among other things civil and criminal penalties material fines equitable remedies including profit disgorgement and injunctions on future conduct securities litigation and a general loss of investor confidence Disruptions in our global supply chain including product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners may negatively impact our business Our ability to meet our customers needs and achieve cost targets depends on our ability to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements including execution of supply chain optimizations and certain sole supplier or sole manufacturing arrangements The loss or disruption of such manufacturing and supply arrangements could interrupt product supply and if not effectively managed and remedied have an adverse impact on our business We outsource certain manufacturing and logistical services to partners located throughout the world Our reliance on these third parties reduces our control over the manufacturing and delivery process exposing us to risks including reduced control over quality assurance product costs product supply and delivery delays If we are unable to effectively manage these relationships or if these third parties experience delays disruptions capacity constraints regulatory issues or quality control problems in their operations or otherwise fail to meet our future requirements for timely delivery our ability to ship and deliver certain of our products to our customers could be impaired and our business could be harmed We may be subject to risks relating to our information technology and operational technology systems We rely extensively on information technology and operational technology systems networks and services including hardware software firmware and technological applications and platforms collectively IT Systems to manage and operate our business from endtoend including ordering and managing materials from suppliers design and development manufacturing marketing selling and shipping to customers invoicing and billing managing our banking and cash liquidity systems managing our enterprise resource planning and other accounting and financial systems and complying with regulatory legal and tax requirements There can be no assurance that our current IT Systems will function properly We have invested and will continue to invest in improving our IT Systems Some of these investments are significant and impact many important operational processes and procedures There is no assurance that any newly implemented IT Systems will improve our current systems improve our operations or yield the expected returns on the investments In addition the implementation of new IT Systems may cause disruptions in our operations and if not properly implemented and maintained negatively impact our business If our IT Systems cease to function properly or if these systems do not provide the anticipated benefits our ability to manage our operations could be impaired 16 Table of Contents We currently rely on thirdparty vendors for many of the critical elements of our global information and operational technology infrastructure and their failure to provide effective support for such infrastructure could negatively impact our business and financial results We have outsourced many of the critical elements of our global information and operational technology infrastructure to thirdparty service providers in order to achieve efficiencies If such service providers do not perform or do not perform effectively we may not be able to achieve the expected efficiencies and may have to incur additional costs to address failures in providing service by the service providers Depending on the function involved such nonperformance ineffective performance or failures of service may lead to business disruptions processing inefficiencies or security breaches Disruptions or breaches of our information systems could adversely affect us Despite our implementation of network security measures which have focused on prevention mitigation resilience and recovery our network and products including access solutions may be vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks computer viruses malicious codes malware ransomware phishing social engineering denial of service hacking breakins and similar disruptions Cybersecurity attacks and intrusion efforts are continuous and evolving and in certain cases they have been successful at the most robust institutions The scope and severity of risks that cyber threats present have increased dramatically and include but are not limited to malicious software attempts to gain unauthorized access to data or premises exploiting weaknesses related to vendors or other third parties that could be exploited to attack our systems denials of service and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data Any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition as we face regulatory reputational and litigation risks resulting from potential cyber incidents as well as the potential of incurring significant remediation costs Our daily business operations also require us to retain sensitive data such as intellectual property proprietary business information and data related to customers suppliers and business partners within our networking infrastructure including data from individuals subject to the European Unions General Data Protection Regulation The loss or breach of such information due to various causes including catastrophic events natural disasters power outages system failures computer viruses improper data handling and employee error or malfeasance could result in wide reaching negative impacts to our business and as such the ongoing maintenance and security of this information is pertinent to the success of our business operations and our strategic goals Our networking infrastructure and related assets may be subject to unauthorized access by hackers employee error or malfeasance or other unforeseen activities Such issues could result in the disruption of business processes network degradation and system downtime along with the potential that a third party will exploit our critical assets such as intellectual property proprietary business information and data related to our customers suppliers and business partners To the extent that such disruptions occur and our business continuity plans do not effectively address these disruptions in a timely manner they may cause delays in the manufacture or shipment of our products and the cancellation of customer orders and as a result our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected resulting in a possible loss of business or brand reputation Commodity shortages price increases and higher energy prices could negatively affect our financial results We rely on suppliers to secure commodities including steel zinc brass and other nonferrous metals required for the manufacture of our products A disruption of deliveries from our suppliers or decreased availability of commodities could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs We believe that available sources of supply will generally be sufficient for our needs for the foreseeable future Nonetheless the unavailability of some commodities could have a material adverse impact on our business Volatility in the prices of these commodities could increase the costs of our products and services and we may not be able to pass on these costs to our customers We do not currently use financial derivatives to hedge against this volatility however we utilize firm purchase commitments to mitigate risk The pricing of some commodities we use is based on market prices To mitigate this exposure we may use annual price contracts to minimize the impact of inflation and to benefit from deflation Additionally we are exposed to fluctuations in energy prices due to the instability of current market prices Higher energy costs increase our operating costs and the cost of shipping our products and supplying services to our customers around the world Consequently sharp price increases the imposition of taxes or an interruption of supply could cause us to lose the ability to effectively manage the risk of rising energy prices and may have an adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows 17 Table of Contents We may be required to recognize impairment charges for our goodwill indefinitelived intangible assets and other longlived assets At December 31 2018  the net carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets totaled approximately 8830 million and 1306 million  respectively Pursuant to GAAP we are required to annually assess our goodwill indefinitelived intangibles and other longlived assets to determine if they are impaired In addition interim assessments must be performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred If the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred we are required to record a noncash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill or other indefinitelived intangible assets and the fair value of the goodwill or other indefinitelived intangible assets in the period the determination is made Disruptions to our business end market conditions and protracted economic weakness unexpected significant declines in operating results of reporting units divestitures and market capitalization declines may result in additional charges for goodwill and other asset impairments We have significant intangible assets including goodwill with an indefinite life which are susceptible to valuation adjustments as a result of changes in such factors and conditions The basis of the fair value for our impairment assessments is determined by projecting future cash flows using assumptions concerning future operating performance and economic conditions that may differ from actual cash flows Financial and credit market volatility directly impacts our fair value measurement through our weightedaverage cost of capital that we use to determine our discount rate and through our stock price that we use to determine our market capitalization Although our last analysis regarding the fair values of the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for our reporting units indicates that they exceed their respective carrying values materially different assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses or significant declines in our stock price could result in goodwill and intangible asset impairment losses Specifically an unanticipated deterioration in Net revenues and operating margins generated by our EMEIA andor Asia Pacific segments could trigger future impairment in those segments While we currently believe that our projected results will not result in future impairment a deterioration in results or other factors could trigger a future impairment Our ability to successfully grow and expand our business depends on our ability to recruit and retain a highly qualified and diverse workforce Our ability to successfully grow and expand our business depends on the contributions and abilities of our employees and key management including for example the ability of our sales force to adapt to any changes made in the sales organization and achieve adequate customer coverage We must therefore continue to effectively recruit retain and motivate key management sales and other highly qualified and skilled personnel to maintain our current business and support our projected growth A shortage of these key employees for various reasons including changes in laws and policies regarding immigration and work authorizations in jurisdictions where we have operations might jeopardize our ability to grow and expand our business Our operations are subject to regulatory risks Our US and nonUS operations are subject to a number of laws and regulations including fire and building codes and environmental health and safety standards We have incurred and will be required to continue to incur significant expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations Changes to or changes in interpretations of current laws and regulations could require us to increase our compliance expenditures cause us to significantly alter or discontinue offering existing products and services or cause us to develop new products and services Altering current products and services or developing new products and services to comply with changes in the applicable laws and regulations could require significant research and development investments increase the cost of providing the products and services and adversely affect the demand for our products and services In the event a regulatory authority concludes that we are not or have not at all times been in full compliance with these laws or regulations we could be fined criminally charged or otherwise sanctioned Certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners of real property or operators of manufacturing facilities for the costs of investigation removal or remediation of hazardous substances or materials at such properties or at properties at which parties have disposed of hazardous substances Liability for investigative removal and remedial costs under certain US federal and state laws and certain nonUS laws are retroactive strict and joint and several In addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances We have received notification from US and nonUS governmental agencies including the EPA and similar state environmental agencies that conditions at a number of current and formerly owned sites where we and others have disposed of hazardous substances require investigation cleanup and other possible remedial action These agencies may require that we reimburse the government for its costs incurred at these sites or otherwise pay for the costs of investigation and cleanup of these sites including by providing compensation for natural resource damage claims from such sites For more information see Business  Environmental Regulation 18 Table of Contents While we have planned for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with environmental laws and have accrued for costs related to current remedial efforts our costs of compliance or our liabilities arising from past or future releases of or exposures to hazardous substances may exceed our estimates We may also be subject to additional environmental claims for personal injury or cost recovery actions for remediation of facilities in the future based on our past present or future business activities The capital and credit markets are important to our business Instability in US and global capital and credit markets including market disruptions limited liquidity and interest rate volatility or reductions in the credit ratings assigned to us by independent ratings agencies could reduce our access to capital markets or increase the cost of funding our short and longterm credit requirements In particular if we are unable to access capital and credit markets on terms that are acceptable to us we may not be able to make certain investments or fully execute our business plans and strategy Our suppliers and customers are also dependent upon the capital and credit markets Limitations on the ability of customers suppliers or financial counterparties to access credit could lead to insolvencies of key suppliers and customers limit or prevent customers from obtaining credit to finance purchases of our products and services and cause delays in the delivery of key products from suppliers As a global business we have a relatively complex tax structure and there is a risk that tax authorities will disagree with our tax positions Since we conduct operations worldwide through our subsidiaries we are subject to complex transfer pricing regulations in the countries in which we operate Transfer pricing regulations generally require that for tax purposes transactions between us and our affiliates be priced on a basis that would be comparable to an arms length transaction and that contemporaneous documentation be maintained to support the tax allocation Although uniform transfer pricing standards are emerging in many of the countries in which we operate there is still a relatively high degree of uncertainty and inherent subjectivity in complying with these rules To the extent that any tax authority disagrees with our transfer pricing policies we could become subject to significant tax liabilities and penalties Our tax returns are subject to review by taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate Although we believe that we have provided for all tax exposures the ultimate outcome of a tax review could differ materially from our provisions We could be subject to changes in tax rates the adoption of new US or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities Our future effective tax rate and cash tax obligations could be adversely affected by shifts in our mix of earnings in countries with varying statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities or changes in tax laws regulations interpretations or accounting principles as well as certain discrete items In addition we are subject to regular review and audit by both US and nonUS tax authorities As a result we have received and may in the future receive assessments in multiple jurisdictions on various taxrelated assertions Any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition In addition the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain Although we believe our estimates are reasonable the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made Furthermore due to shifting economic and political conditions tax policies laws interpretations and rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change which could materially affect our financial position and results of operations For example the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act the Tax Reform Act enacted in December 2017 in the US had a significant impact on our cash tax obligations and the issuance of additional regulatory guidance related to the Tax Reform Act could materially affect our cash tax obligations and effective tax rate In addition many countries in Europe as well as a number of other countries and organizations have recently proposed or recommended changes to existing tax laws or have enacted new laws that could significantly increase our effective tax rate or cash tax obligations in many countries where we do business or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business There are risks associated with our outstanding and future indebtedness We have approximately 15 billion of outstanding indebtedness at December 31 2018  In addition we have a senior unsecured revolving credit facility that permits borrowings of up to an additional 500 million  Volatility in the credit markets could adversely impact our ability to obtain favorable financing terms in the future A substantial portion of our cash flows from operations is 19 Table of Contents dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness and will not be available for other purposes including our operations capital expenditures payment of dividends share repurchase programs or future business opportunities Our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial and operating performance which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business and other factors beyond our control If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures reduce or eliminate the payment of dividends sell assets seek additional capital or seek to restructure or refinance our indebtedness These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations In the absence of such operating results and resources we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to sell material assets or operations to attempt to meet our debt service and other obligations Additionally a portion of our borrowings at December 31 2018 includes a term loan with a variable rate of interest which exposes us to interest rate risk We are exposed to the risk of rising interest rates to the extent that we fund our operations with shortterm or variablerate borrowings At December 31 2018  our 15 billion of aggregate debt outstanding includes  656 million of floatingrate term loans and 800 million of fixedrate senior notes We have the ability to incur up to 500 million of additional floatingrate debt under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility We have entered into interest rate swaps for 250 million of our floatingrate term loans to manage our interest rate risk A 100 basispoint increase in LIBOR would have resulted in incremental 2018 interest expense of approximately 43 million  If the LIBOR or other applicable base rates under our senior unsecured credit facilities increase in the future the interest on floatingrate debt could have a material impact on our interest expense Risks Relating to the Spinoff In connection with the Spinoff Ingersoll Rand indemnified us for certain liabilities and we indemnified Ingersoll Rand for certain liabilities If we are required to act on these indemnities to Ingersoll Rand we may need to divert cash to meet those obligations and our financial results could be negatively impacted The Ingersoll Rand indemnity may not be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of liabilities for which it will be allocated responsibility and Ingersoll Rand may not be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations in the future Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement the Employee Matters Agreement and the Tax Matters Agreement with Ingersoll Rand Ingersoll Rand agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities and we agreed to indemnify Ingersoll Rand for certain liabilities in each case for uncapped amounts Such indemnities may be significant and could negatively impact our business particularly indemnities relating to our actions that could impact the taxfree nature of the Spinoff Third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that Ingersoll Rand retained Further the indemnity from Ingersoll Rand may not be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities and Ingersoll Rand may not be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations Moreover even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from Ingersoll Rand any amounts for which we are held liable we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves If the distribution or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the Spinoff are determined to be taxable for US federal income tax purposes we our shareholders that are subject to US federal income tax andor Ingersoll Rand could incur significant US federal income tax liabilities and in certain circumstances we could be required to indemnify Ingersoll Rand for material taxes pursuant to indemnification obligations under the Tax Matters Agreement Ingersoll Rand has received an IRS ruling substantially to the effect that among other things the distribution of our ordinary shares together with certain related transactions qualify under Sections 355 and 368a of the Internal Revenue Code the Code with the result that Ingersoll Rand and Ingersoll Rands shareholders will not recognize any taxable income gain or loss for US federal income tax purposes as a result of the Spinoff except to the extent of cash received in lieu of fractional shares the IRS Ruling The IRS Ruling also provided that certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the distribution qualify for favorable treatment under the Code In addition to obtaining the IRS Ruling Ingersoll Rand received opinions from the law firm of Simpson Thacher  Bartlett LLP substantially to the effect that certain requirements including certain requirements that the IRS did not rule on necessary to obtain taxfree treatment have been satisfied such that the distribution for US federal income tax purposes and certain other matters relating to the distribution including certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the distribution received taxfree treatment under Section 355 of the Code The receipt and effectiveness of the IRS Ruling and the opinions were conditions to the distribution that were satisfied or waived by Ingersoll Rand The IRS Ruling and the opinions rely on certain facts and assumptions and certain representations and undertakings from us and Ingersoll Rand regarding the past and future conduct of our respective businesses and other matters Notwithstanding the IRS Ruling and the opinions the IRS could determine on audit that the distribution or the internal transactions should be treated as taxable transactions if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings is not correct or has been violated or that the distribution or the internal transactions should be taxable for other reasons including as a result of significant changes in shares or asset ownership after the distribution A legal opinion represents the tax advisers best legal judgment is not binding on the IRS or the courts and 20 Table of Contents the IRS or the courts may not agree with the opinion In addition the opinion will be based on then current law and cannot be relied upon if current law changes with retroactive effect If the distribution is determined to be taxable the distribution could be treated as a taxable dividend or capital gain for US federal income tax purposes and our shareholders could incur significant US federal income tax liabilities In addition we or Ingersoll Rand could incur significant US federal income tax liabilities if it is ultimately determined that certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the distribution are taxable In addition under the terms of the Tax Matters Agreement in the event the distribution or the internal transactions were determined to be taxable as a result of actions taken after the distribution by us or Ingersoll Rand the party responsible for such failure would be responsible for all taxes imposed on us or Ingersoll Rand as a result thereof If such failure is not the result of actions taken after the distribution by us or Ingersoll Rand then we would be responsible for any taxes imposed on us or Ingersoll Rand as a result of such determination Such tax amounts could be significant If the distribution is determined to be taxable for Irish tax purposes significant Irish tax liabilities may arise Ingersoll Rand has received an opinion of the Irish Revenue regarding the Irish tax consequences of the distribution to the effect that certain reliefs and exemptions for corporate reorganizations apply In addition to obtaining the opinion from Irish Revenue Ingersoll Rand received an opinion from the law firm of Arthur Cox confirming the applicability of the relevant exemptions and reliefs to the distribution and that certain internal transactions will not trigger tax costs These opinions rely on certain facts and assumptions and certain representations and undertakings from us and Ingersoll Rand regarding the past and future conduct of our respective businesses and other matters Notwithstanding the opinions the Irish Revenue could determine on audit that the distribution or the internal transactions do not qualify for the relevant exemptions or reliefs if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings is not correct or has been violated A legal opinion represents the tax advisers best legal judgment is not binding on the Irish Revenue or the courts and the Irish Revenue or the courts may not agree with the legal opinion In addition the legal opinion was based on then current law and cannot be relied upon if current law changes with retroactive effect If the distribution ultimately is determined not to fall within certain exemptions or reliefs the distribution could result in our shareholders having an Irish tax liability as a result of the distribution if a shareholder is an Irish resident or holds shares in Ingersoll Rand in an Irish branch or agency or we or Ingersoll Rand could incur Irish tax liabilities In addition under the terms of the Tax Matters Agreement in the event the distribution does not qualify for certain reliefs or exemptions then we would be responsible for any taxes imposed on us or Ingersoll Rand as a result of such determination Such tax amounts could be significant Risks Related to Our Incorporation in Ireland Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and may afford less protection to holders of our securities The US currently does not have a treaty with Ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters As such there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of Ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of US courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on US federal or state civil liability laws including the civil liability provisions of the US federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws As an Irish company we are governed by the Companies Act 2014 of Ireland as amended which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to US corporations and shareholders including among others differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits Likewise the duties of directors and officers of an Irish company generally are owed to the company only Shareholders of Irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances Accordingly holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the US In addition Irish law allows shareholders to authorize share capital which then can be issued by a board of directors without shareholder approval Also subject to specified exceptions Irish law grants statutory preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares for cash At our annual meeting of shareholders our shareholders authorized our Board of Directors to issue up to 33 of our issued ordinary shares and further authorized our Board of Directors to issue up to 5 of such shares for cash without first offering them to our existing shareholders Both of these authorizations will expire after a certain period unless renewed by our shareholders and we cannot guarantee that the renewal of these authorizations will always be approved 21 Table of Contents Changes in tax laws regulations or treaties changes in our status under the tax laws of many jurisdictions or adverse determinations by taxing authorities could increase our tax burden or otherwise affect our financial condition or operating results as well as subject our shareholders to additional taxes The realization of any tax benefit related to our incorporation and tax residence in Ireland could be impacted by changes in tax laws tax treaties or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof by the tax authorities of many jurisdictions From time to time proposals have been made andor legislation has been introduced to change the tax laws of various jurisdictions or limit tax treaty benefits that if enacted could materially increase our tax burden andor our effective tax rate For instance pending regulatory guidance on the recently enacted US tax legislation could modify or eliminate the tax deductibility of various currently deductible payments which could materially and adversely affect our effective tax rate and cash tax position Moreover other legislative proposals could have a material adverse impact on us by overriding certain tax treaties and limiting the treaty benefits on certain payments which could increase our tax liability We cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislation in any jurisdiction While we monitor proposals that would materially impact our tax burden andor our effective tax rate and investigate our options we could still be subject to increased taxation on a going forward basis no matter what action we undertake if certain legislative proposals are enacted certain tax treaties are amended andor our interpretation of applicable tax law is challenged and determined to be incorrect In particular any changes andor differing interpretations of applicable tax law that have the effect of disregarding our incorporation in Ireland limiting our ability to take advantage of tax treaties between jurisdictions modifying or eliminating the deductibility of various currently deductible payments or increasing the tax burden of operating or being resident in a particular country could subject us to increased taxation Dividends received by our shareholders may be subject to Irish dividend withholding tax In certain circumstances we are required to deduct Irish dividend withholding tax currently at the rate of 20 from dividends paid to our shareholders In the majority of cases shareholders residing in the US will not be subject to Irish withholding tax and shareholders resident in a number of other countries will not be subject to Irish withholding tax provided that they complete certain Irish dividend withholding tax forms However some shareholders may be subject to withholding tax which could discourage the investment in our stock and adversely impact the price of our shares Dividends received by our shareholders could be subject to Irish income tax Dividends paid in respect of our shares generally are not subject to Irish income tax where the beneficial owner of these dividends is exempt from Irish dividend withholding tax unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with Ireland other than his or her shareholding in Allegion Our shareholders who receive their dividends subject to Irish dividend withholding tax will generally have no further liability to Irish income tax on the dividends unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with Ireland other than his or her shareholding in Allegion Certain provisions in our Memorandum and Articles of Association among other things could prevent or delay an acquisition of us which could decrease the trading price of our ordinary shares Our Memorandum and Articles of Association contains provisions to deter takeover practices inadequate takeover bids and unsolicited offers These provisions include amongst others  a provision of our Articles of Association which generally prohibits us from engaging in a business combination with an interested shareholder being i the beneficial owner directly or indirectly of 10 or more of our voting shares or ii an affiliate or associate of us that has at any time within the last five years been the beneficial owner directly or indirectly or 1 or more of our voting shares subject to certain exceptions  rules regarding how shareholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at shareholder meetings  the right of our Board of Directors to issue preferred shares without shareholder approval in certain circumstances subject to applicable law and  the ability of our Board of Directors to set the number of directors and to fill vacancies on our Board of Directors in certain circumstances We believe these provisions will provide some protection to our shareholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics These provisions are not intended to make us immune from takeovers However these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our Board of Directors determines 22 Table of Contents is in our best interests and our shareholders best interests These provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors In addition several mandatory provisions of Irish law could prevent or delay an acquisition of us For example Irish law does not permit shareholders of an Irish public limited company to take action by written consent with less than unanimous consent We also will be subject to various provisions of Irish law relating to mandatory bids voluntary bids requirements to make a cash offer and minimum price requirements as well as substantial acquisition rules and rules requiring the disclosure of interests in our shares in certain circumstances Also Irish companies including us may alter their Memorandum of Association and Articles of Association only with the approval of at least 75 of the votes of the companys shareholders cast in person or by proxy at a general meeting of the company The agreements that we entered into with Ingersoll Rand in connection with the Spinoff generally require Ingersoll Rands consent to any assignment by us of our rights and obligations under the agreements The consent and termination rights set forth in these agreements might discourage delay or prevent a change of control that shareholders may consider favorable 23 Table of Contents Item 1B UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None Item 2 PROPERTIES We operate through a broad
