wwwabiomedcom our annual reports on Form 10K quarterly reports on Form 10Q current reports on Form 8K and any amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after filing such reports with or furnishing such reports to the US Securities and Exchange Commission or SEC We also use our website for the distribution of Company information The information we post on our website may be deemed to be material information Accordingly investors should monitor our website in addition to following our press releases SEC filings and public conference calls and webcasts The contents of our website are not incorporated by reference into this report Our Company We are a leading provider of temporary mechanical circulatory support devices and we offer a continuum of care to heart failure patients We develop manufacture and market proprietary products that are designed to enable the heart to rest heal and recover by improving blood flow to the coronary arteries and endorgans andor temporarily assisting the pumping function of the heart Our products are used in the cardiac catheterization lab or cath lab by interventional cardiologists the electrophysiology lab the hybrid lab and in the heart surgery suite by cardiac surgeons A physician may use our devices for patients who are in need of hemodynamic support prophylactically urgently or emergently before during or after angioplasty or heart surgery procedures We believe that heart recovery is the optimal clinical outcome for a patient experiencing heart failure because it enhances the potential for the patient to go home with their own heart facilitating the restoration of quality of life In addition we believe that for the care of such patients heart recovery is often the most costeffective solution for the healthcare system Our strategic focus and the driver of our revenue growth is the market penetration of our family of Impella heart pumps The Impella device portfolio which includes the Impella 25 Impella CP Impella 50 Impella LD Impella 55 and Impella RP devices has supported thousands of patients worldwide We expect that most of our product and service revenue in the near future will be from our Impella devices Our Impella 25 Impella CP Impella 50 Impella LD Impella 55 and Impella RP devices have US Food and Drug Administration or FDA and CE Mark which allows us to market these devices in the US and European Union We expect to continue to make additional premarket approval or PMA supplement submissions for our Impella portfolio of devices for additional indications Our Impella 25 Impella CP and Impella 50 devices have regulatory approval from the Ministry of Health Labor and Welfare or MHLW in Japan COVID19 Pandemic For a discussion of the impact of the COVID19 pandemic on our business see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsCOVID19 Pandemic Our Products Impella 25 The Impella 25 device is a percutaneous micro heart pump with an integrated motor and sensors The device is designed primarily for use by interventional cardiologists to support patients in the cath lab who may require assistance to maintain circulation The Impella 25 heart pump can be quickly inserted via the femoral artery to reach the left ventricle of the heart where it is directly deployed to draw blood out of the ventricle and deliver it to the circulatory system This function is intended to reduce ventricular work and provide blood flow to vital organs The Impella 25 heart pump is introduced with normal interventional cardiology procedures and can pump up to 25 liters of blood per minute 1 In March 2015 we received a premarket approval or PMA  from the FDA for the use of the Impella 25 device during elective and urgent highrisk percutaneous coronary intervention or PCI  procedures With this PMA the Impella 25 device became the first FDA approved hemodynamic support device for use during highrisk PCI procedures Under this PMA the Impella 25 is a temporary up to six hours ventricular support device indicated for use during highrisk PCI performed in elective or urgent hemodynamically stable patients with severe coronary artery disease and depressed left ventricular ejection fraction when a heart team including a cardiac surgeon has determined highrisk PCI is the appropriate therapeutic option Use of the Impella 25 device in these patients may prevent hemodynamic instability that may occur during planned temporary coronary occlusions and may reduce periprocedural and postprocedural adverse events The product labeling allows for the clinical decision by physicians to leave the Impella 25 device in place beyond the intended duration of up to six hours should unforeseen circumstances arise In April 2016 the FDA approved a PMA supplement for certain of our devices including our Impella 25 device to provide treatment for ongoing cardiogenic shock This PMA supplement covers a set of indications related to the use of the Impella devices in patients suffering cardiogenic shock following acute myocardial infarction or cardiac surgery and allows for a longer duration of support The Impella 25 catheter in conjunction with the Automated Impella Controller or Impella AIC was approved as a temporary ventricular support device intended for short term use  4 days and indicated for the treatment of ongoing cardiogenic shock that occurs immediately  48 hours following acute myocardial infarction as a result of isolated left ventricular failure that is not responsive to optimal medical management and conventional treatment measures The intent of the Impella system therapy is to reduce ventricular work and to provide the circulatory support necessary to allow heart recovery and early assessment of residual myocardial function Optimal medical management and convention treatment measures include volume loading and use of pressors and inotropes with or without an intraaortic balloon pump or IABP In September 2016 we received Pharmaceuticals and Medical Device Agency or PMDA approval from the Ministry of Health Labour and Welfare or MHLW for our Impella 25 heart pump to provide treatment of drugresistant acute heart failure in Japan In July 2017 we received approval from the MHLW for reimbursement of the Impella 25 heart pump In February 2018 we received two expanded PMAs from the FDA for certain of our Impella heart pumps The first expanded PMA includes the Impella 25 heart pump for use on patients with cardiogenic shock associated with cardiomyopathy including peripartum and postpartum cardiomyopathy The second expanded PMA includes the Impella 25 heart pump for use during elective and highrisk PCI procedures This expanded PMA confirms Impella support as appropriate in patients with severe coronary artery disease complex anatomy and extensive comorbidities with or without depressed ejection fraction In September 2019 we announced the results of PROTECT III the ongoing prospective singlearm FDA postapproval study for the PMA approval of Impella 25 and Impella CP in highrisk PCI PROTECT III follows the PROTECT II randomized controlled trial that was completed in December 2010 The findings of this interim analysis on 898 patients demonstrates a reduction in the primary endpoint of death stroke myocardial infarction and repeat procedures at 90 days with Impellasupported Protected PCI compared to PROTECT II The Impella 25 device has CE Mark approval in the European Union for up to five days of use and is approved for use in up to 40 countries The Impella 25 device also has Health Canada approval which allows us to market the device in Canada Impella CP The Impella CP device provides blood flow of approximately one liter more per minute than the Impella 25 device and is primarily used by either interventional cardiologists to support patients in the cath lab or by cardiac surgeons in the heart surgery suite In April 2016 the FDA approved a PMA supplement for certain of our devices including our Impella CP device to provide treatment for ongoing cardiogenic shock This PMA supplement covers a set of indications related to the use of the Impella devices in patients suffering cardiogenic shock following acute myocardial infarction or cardiac surgery and allows for a longer duration of support The Impella CP catheter in conjunction with the Automated Impella Controller or AIC was approved as a temporary ventricular support device intended for short term use  4 days and indicated for the treatment of ongoing cardiogenic shock that occurs immediately  48 hours following acute myocardial infarction as a result of isolated left ventricular failure that is not responsive to optimal medical management and conventional treatment measures The intent of the Impella system therapy is to reduce ventricular work and to provide the circulatory support necessary to allow heart recovery and early assessment of residual myocardial function Optimal medical management and convention treatment measures include volume loading and use of pressors and inotropes with or without an intraaortic balloon pump or IABP In December 2016 the FDA expanded a previously received PMA that granted approval for the use of the Impella CP device during elective and urgent highrisk PCI procedures in the US With this indication the Impella CP and the Impella 25 devices provide the only minimally invasive treatment options indicated for use during highrisk PCI procedures in the US 2 In February 2018 we received two expanded PMAs from the FDA for certain of our Impella heart pumps The first expanded PMA includes the Impella CP heart pump for use on patients with cardiogenic shock associated with cardiomyopathy including peripartum and postpartum cardiomyopathy The second expanded PMA includes the Impella CP heart pump for use during elective and highrisk PCI procedures  and it confirms Impella support as appropriate in patients with severe coronary artery disease complex anatomy and extensive comorbidities with or without depressed ejection fraction These PMAs allow the Impella CP to be used as a temporary  6 hours ventricular support system indicated for use during high risk PCI procedures performed in elective or urgent hemodynamically stable patients with severe coronary artery disease and depressed left ventricular ejection fraction when a heart team including a cardiac surgeon has determined that highrisk PCI is the appropriate therapeutic option The product labeling allows for the clinical decision by physicians to leave the Impella CP device in place beyond the intended duration of up to six hours should unforeseen circumstances arise In April 2018 we received FDA approval for our Impella CP SmartAssist platform The Impella CP SmartAssist platform includes optical sensor technology on our Impella CP pump that allows for improved positioning the use of algorithms that enable improved native heart assessment during the weaning process and cloudbased technology that enables secure realtime remote viewing of the Impella console for physicians and hospital staff from anywhere with internet connectivity In March 2019 we received PMDA approval from MHLW for our Impella CP heart pump in Japan We began selling the Impella CP heart pump in Japan in fiscal 2020 The Impella CP device has CE Mark approval in the European Union and other countries that require a CE Mark approval for up to five days of use Impella 50 and Impella LD The Impella 50 and Impella LD devices are percutaneous micro heart pumps with integrated motors and sensors for use primarily in the heart surgery suite These devices are designed to support patients who require higher levels of circulatory support as compared to the Impella 25 or Impella CP The Impella 50 device can be inserted into the left ventricle via a femoral cut down or through the axillary artery The Impella 50 device is passed into the ascending aorta across the valve and into the left ventricle The Impella LD device is similar to the Impella 50 device but it is implanted directly into the ascending aorta through an aortic graft Both devices are normally used by cardiac surgeons in the surgery suite The Impella 50 and Impella LD devices can pump up to five liters of blood per minute potentially providing full circulatory support In April 2016 the FDA approved a PMA supplement for certain of our devices including our Impella 50 and Impella LD devices to provide treatment for ongoing cardiogenic shock This PMA supplement covers a set of indications related to the use of the Impella devices in patients suffering cardiogenic shock following acute myocardial infarction or cardiac surgery and allows for a longer duration of support The Impella 50 and LD catheters in conjunction with the Impella AIC were approved as temporary ventricular support devices intended for short term use  6 days and indicated for the treatment of ongoing cardiogenic shock that occurs immediately  48 hours following acute myocardial infarction as a result of isolated left ventricular failure that is not responsive to optimal medical management and conventional treatment measures The intent of the Impella system therapy is to reduce ventricular work and to provide the circulatory support necessary to allow heart recovery and early assessment of residual myocardial function In September 2016 we received PMDA approval from the Japanese Ministry Health Labour and Welfare MHLW for our Impella 50 heart pump to provide treatment of drugresistant acute heart failure in Japan In July 2017 we received approval from the Japanese MHLW for reimbursement for the Impella 50 heart pump Reimbursement in Japan for the Impella 50 is equivalent to our average Impella sales price in the US In May 2019 we received an expanded PMA from the FDA for labeling of the Impella 50 and Impella LD for the treatment of cardiogenic shock The expansion extends the duration of support for each pump from six days to 14 days This approval expands the previous indication for acute myocardial infarction cardiogenic shock and postcardiotomy shock or PCCS received in April 2016 and use of the Impella 50 and Impella LD heart pumps to provide treatment for heart failure associated with cardiomyopathy leading to cardiogenic shock received in February 2018 The Impella 50 and Impella LD devices have CE Mark approval in the European Union for up to ten days duration and are approved for use in over 40 countries 3 Impella 55  The Impella 55 device is designed to be a percutaneous micro heart pump with integrated motors and sensors Impella 55 delivers peak flows of greater than six liters per minute The Impella 55 has a motor housing that is thinner and 45 shorter than the Impella 50 and it improves ease of pump insertion through the vasculature In September 2019 the Impella 55 device received a PMA from the FDA for safety and efficacy in the therapy of cardiogenic shock for up to 14 days in the US The Impella 55 pump was introduced in the US through a controlled rollout at hospitals with established heart recovery protocols beginning in fiscal 2020 Impella 55 received CE marking approval in Europe in April 2018 and was introduced in Europe through a similar controlled rollout The adoption of the Impella 55 device may lessen the utilization of Impella 50 and Impella LD at certain sites Impella RP The Impella RP is a percutaneous catheterbased axial flow pump that is designed to allow greater than four liters of blood flow per minute and is intended to provide the flow and pressure needed to compensate for right side heart failure The Impella RP is the first percutaneous single access heart pump designed for right heart support to receive FDA approval The Impella RP device is approved to provide support of the right heart during times of acute failure for certain patients who have received a left ventricle assist device or have suffered heart failure due to AMI a failed heart transplant or following open heart surgery In September 2017 we received a PMA from the FDA for the Impella RP heart pump This latest approval follows the prior FDA humanitarian device exemption or HDE received in January 2015 and adds the Impella RP heart pump to our platform of devices with PMAs The Impella RP heart pump is indicated for providing temporary right ventricular support for up to 14 days in patients with a body surface area 15 m who develop acute right heart failure or decompensation following left ventricular assist device implantation myocardial infarction heart transplant or openheart surgery With this approval the Impella RP heart pump is the only percutaneous temporary ventricular support device that is FDAapproved as safe and effective for right heart failure as stated in the indication The Impella RP device has CE Mark approval for commercial sale in the European Union and other countries that require a CE Mark approval for commercial sales Impella SmartAssist The Impella SmartAssist platform includes optical sensor technology for improved pump positioning and the use of algorithms that enable improved native heart assessment during the weaning process The Impella SmartAssist platform currently developed for the Impella CP SmartAssist and Impella 55 SmartAssist heart pumps The Impella SmartAssist platform is also approved under CE Mark in the European Union and other countries that require a CE Mark approval Impella Connect Impella Connect is a cloudbased technology that enables secure cloudbased remote viewing of the Automated Impella Controller or AIC for physicians and hospital staff from anywhere with internet connectivity The Impella Connect is intended to provide enhanced monitoring capability reduce setup time and improve ease of use for physicians We began a controlled rollout of Impella Connect at certain hospital sites during fiscal 2020 and we plan to transition the majority of our customers in fiscal 2021 Our Product Pipeline Impella ECP The Impella ECP pump is designed for blood flow of greater than three liters per minute It is intended to be delivered on a standard sized catheter and will include an expandable inflow in the left ventricle We expect to conduct a firstinhuman trial in fiscal year 2021 subject to our ability to do so under the circumstances of the ongoing or any future outbreak of the novel coronavirus or COVID19 The Impella ECP pump is still in development and has not been approved for commercial use or sale 4 Impella XR Sheath The Impella XR Sheath is a sheath designed to expand and recoil to all for ease of use upon insertion of an Impella heart pump and minimize the size of the arteriotomy The Impella XR Sheath device is still in development and has not been approved for commercial use or sale We expect to submit an application for FDA 510k clearance in fiscal 2021 subject to our ability to do so under the circumstances of the ongoing or any future outbreak of the novel coronavirus or COVID19 Impella BTR The Impella BTR device is designed to be a percutaneous micro heart pump with integrated motors and sensors The Impella BTR device is designed to be smaller provide up to one year of hemodynamic support and is expected to allow for greater than five liters of blood flow per minute The Impella BTR device also includes a wearable driver designed for hospital discharge The Impella BTR pump is still in development and has not been approved for commercial use or sale Our Markets According to the Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics 2020 Update Report from the American Heart Association or AHA coronary heart disease or CHD is the number one cause of death in the US According to the report 47 of women and 36 of men over the age of 45 will die within five years of their first heart attack and CHD causes approximately one of every seven deaths in the US CHD is a condition of the coronary arteries that causes reduced blood flow and insufficient oxygen delivery to the affected portion of the heart CHD leads to acute myocardial infarction or AMI commonly known as a heart attack which may lead to heart failure a condition in which the heart is unable to pump enough blood to the bodys major organs A broad spectrum of therapies exists for the treatment of patients in early stages of CHD Angioplasty procedures and stents are commonly used in the cath lab to restore and increase blood flow to the heart These treatments are often successful in slowing the progression of heart disease extending life andor improving the quality of life for some period of time Patients presenting with acute cardiac injuries potentially have recoverable hearts Treatment for these patients in preshock in the cath lab is primarily focused on hemodynamic stabilization Acute heart failure patients in profound shock typically require treatment in the surgery suite These are patients suffering from cardiogenic shock after a heart attack postcardiotomy cardiogenic shock or myocarditis complicated with cardiogenic shock Chronic heart failure patients have hearts that are unlikely to be recoverable due to left andor rightside heart failure and their conditions cause their hearts to fail over time Limited therapies exist today for patients with severe endstage or chronic heart failure In more severe cases of heart failure patients are sent directly to the surgery suite for coronary bypass or valve replacement surgery The most severe acute heart failure patients are in profound cardiogenic shock including those suffering from myocarditis a viral attack of the heart or from those suffering from an impaired ability of the heart to pump blood after a heart attack or heart surgery These patients typically require treatments involving the use of mechanical circulatory support devices that provide increased blood flow and reduce the stress on the heart Many less severe patients in the cath lab could also benefit from circulatory support devices or other clinical treatment which could potentially prevent them from entering into profound shock Percutaneous assist devices like the Impella portfolio of devices are mechanical devices that help the failing heart pump blood or take over the pumping function of the failing heart Percutaneous assist devices allow for less invasive placement and removal and can be done through a small puncture in the leg in the cath lab electrophysiology lab or operating room We believe heart recovery is a preferred clinical outcome for patients since it generally lowers the overall relative cost to the healthcare system versus alternative therapies and treatment paths that may require multiple surgeries lengthy or repeated hospital stays chronic therapeutic and immunosuppressant drugs and other related healthcare costs Research and Product Development Since our founding in 1981 we have gained substantial expertise in circulatory support through the development of many product platforms to support heart patients This includes our Impella platform that we currently market and other technologies that we have supported and sold in the past which we do not actively market currently Our current strategy is to develop a complete portfolio of products across the continuum of care in heart recovery primarily focused in the area of circulatory care We intend to continue to use this experience to develop additional circulatory support products as well as making enhancements to our existing products with an emphasis on improving access and closure with our devices In addition we have a number of new products at various stages of development some of which integrate the Impella technology platform including the Impella ECP Impella XR Sheath and Impella BTR devices 5 We expended 988 million 935 million and 753 million on research and development in fiscal years 2020  2019 and 2018  respectively Our research and development expenditures include costs related to clinical trials and studies for our Impella devices We are pursuing additional randomized control trials in highrisk PCI and cardiogenic shock such as the STEMI DTU Study to complement our clinical evidence and best practices to optimize patient outcomes STEMI DTU Study In November 2018 we announced the results of our FDAapproved prospective multicenter feasibility study STEMI Door to Unloading with Impella CP system in acute myocardial infarction STEMI DTU The trial focused on the feasibility and safety of unloading the left ventricle using the Impella CP heart pump prior to primary PCI in patients presenting with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction or STEMI without cardiogenic shock with the hypothesis that this will potentially reduce infarct size The study which received FDA investigational device approval to proceed in October 2016 enrolled 50 patients at 10 sites The hypothesis of this novel approach to treating STEMI patients based on extensive mechanistic research is that unloading the left ventricle prior to PCI reduces myocardial work load and oxygen demand and also initiates a cardioprotective effect at the myocardial cell level which may alleviate myocardial damage caused by reperfusion injury at the time of revascularization The intent of this study was to help refine the protocol and lay the groundwork for a future pivotal study with more sites and patients and will be designed for statistical significance In April 2019 the FDA approved the initiation of the STEMI DTU pivotal randomized controlled trial The prospective multicenter twoarm trial plans to enroll 668 patients undergoing treatment for a STEMI heart attack at up to 60 sites Half the patients will be randomized to receive delayed reperfusion after 30 minutes of left ventricular unloading with the Impella CP The other half will receive immediate reperfusion the current standard of care The STEMI DTU trial will test the hypothesis that unloading the left ventricle for 30 minutes prior to reperfusion will reduce myocardial damage from a heart attack and lead to a reduction in future heart failure related events The trial allows for an adaptive design which permits adjustments to the study sample size after an interim analysis We began the trial in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 However due to the ongoing COVID19 pandemic and the challenges presented to medical providers we have temporarily paused the trial and plan to restart when physicians and hospitals have the ability to enroll patients and record clinical metrics Once we resume we estimate that it will take three to four years to complete enrollment Sales Clinical Support Marketing and Field Service Our clinical support personnel consist primarily of registered nurses and other personnel with considerable experience in either the surgery suite or the cath lab and they play a critical role in training and educating physicians in the use of our products In recent years we have significantly increased the number of our direct sales and clinical support personnel in the US Germany and Japan Manufacturing We manufacture our products in Danvers Massachusetts and Aachen Germany Our Aachen facility performs final assembly and manufactures most of our disposable Impella devices including the Impella 25 Impella CP Impella 50 Impella 55 Impella LD and Impella RP Our Danvers facility also manufactures and performs final assembly for the Impella CP device Impella 55 and certain Impella subsystems and accessories including our Impella AIC our console that powers our Impella devices In addition we rely on thirdparty suppliers to provide us with components used in our existing products and products under development For example we outsource some of the manufacturing for components and circuit cards within our consoles We have expanded our manufacturing capacity in both our Aachen and Danvers facilities to support demand for our Impella devices We believe our existing manufacturing facilities provide sufficient physical capacity to meet anticipated demand for at least the next twelve months Our US and German manufacturing facilities are certified as being in compliance with standards established by the International Organization for Standardization or ISO and operate under the FDAs good manufacturing practice requirements for medical devices set forth in the Quality System Regulation or QSR Intellectual Property We have developed significant knowhow and proprietary technology upon which our business depends To protect our knowhow and proprietary technology we rely on trade secret laws trademarks patents copyrights and confidentiality agreements and other contracts However these methods afford only limited protection Others may independently develop equivalent proprietary information or technology gain access to our trade secrets or disclose or use such secrets or technology without our approval 6 A substantial portion of our intellectual property rights relating to the Impella devices and other products under development such as the Impella ECP Impella XR Sheath and Impella BTR devices are in the form of trade secrets and patents We protect our trade secrets and proprietary knowledge in part through confidentiality agreements with employees consultants and other parties We cannot assure you that our trade secrets will not become known to or be independently developed by our competitors We own or have rights to numerous US and foreign patents Patents filed both in the US and Europe generally have a life of 20 years from the filing date Our US and foreign patents have expiration dates ranging from 2020 to 2036 and beyond as we continue to innovate and file for new patent applications We also own or have rights to certain pending US and foreign patent applications We believe patents will issue pursuant to such applications but cannot guarantee it Moreover neither the timing of any issuance the scope of protection nor the actual issue date of these pending applications can be forecasted with precision Where we have licensed patent rights from third parties we could be required to pay royalties Our patents may not provide us with competitive advantages Our pending or future patent applications may not be issued Others may hold or obtain patents that cover aspects or uses of our innovations The patents of others may render our patents obsolete limit our ability to patent or practice our innovations or otherwise have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct business Because foreign patents may afford less protection than US patents our foreign patent estate may not adequately protect our technology The medical device industry is characterized by a large number of patents and by frequent and consequential intellectual property litigation Our products and technologies could infringe on the proprietary rights of third parties If third parties successfully assert infringement or other claims against us we may not be able to sell our products or we may have to pay significant damages and ongoing royalties In addition patent or intellectual property disputes or litigation may be costly result in product development delays or divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel If any such disputes or litigation arise we may seek to enter into a royalty or licensing arrangement However such an arrangement may not be available on commercially acceptable terms if at all We may decide in the alternative to litigate the claims or seek to design around the patented or otherwise protected proprietary technology which may also be costly and time consuming The US government may obtain certain rights to use or disclose technical data developed under government contracts that supported the development of some of our products We retain the right to obtain patents on any inventions developed under those contracts provided we follow prescribed procedures and are subject to a nonexclusive nontransferable royaltyfree license to the US government Competition Competition among providers of treatments for the failing heart is intense and subject to rapid technological change and evolving industry requirements and standards We compete with many companies that have greater financial product development sales and marketing resources and experience than we do Furthermore new product development and technological change characterize the areas in which we compete Our present or future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical as a result of technological advances by one or more of our present or future competitors or by other therapies including drug therapies We must continue to develop and commercialize new products and technologies to remain competitive in the cardiovascular medical technology industry We believe that we compete primarily on the basis of clinical superiority supported by extensive data and innovative features that enhance patient benefit product performance ease of use and reliability Customer and clinical support and data that demonstrate both improvement in a patients quality of life and a products costeffectiveness are additional aspects of competition The cardiovascular segment of the medical technology industry is dynamic and subject to significant change due to costofcare considerations regulatory reform industry and customer consolidation and evolving patient needs The ability to provide products and technologies that demonstrate value and improve clinical outcomes is becoming increasingly important for medical technology manufacturers We are aware of other cardiac assist device research efforts in the US Canada Europe and Japan In addition there are a number of companies including Abbott Laboratories Medtronic Edwards Lifesciences Boston Scientific LivaNova Terumo Heart Teleflex Getinge Maquet Cardiovascular and several earlystage companies that are developing heart assist products including implantable left ventricular assist devices and miniaturized rotary ventricular assist devices that directly and indirectly compete with our products 7 ThirdParty Reimbursement Our products and services are generally purchased by hospitals that rely on thirdparty payers to cover and reimburse the costs of related patient care In the US as well as in many foreign countries governmentfunded or private insurance programs pay the cost of a significant portion of a patients medical expenses No uniform policy of coverage or reimbursement for medical technology exists among all these payers Therefore coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payer to payer and by jurisdiction Thirdparty payers may include government healthcare programs such as Medicare or Medicaid private insurers or managed care organizations The Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services or CMS is responsible for administering the Medicare program in the US and along with its contractors establishes coverage and reimbursement policies for the Medicare program Medicares coverage and reimbursement policies are particularly significant to our business because a large percentage of the population for which our products are intended includes individuals who are Medicare beneficiaries In addition private payers often follow the coverage and reimbursement policies of Medicare We cannot assure that government or private thirdparty payers will continue to cover and reimburse the procedures using our products in whole or in part in the future or that payment rates for reimbursement will be adequate If governmental and private payers policies do not cover surgical procedures performed using our products we may not be able to generate the revenues necessary to support our business Medicare payment may be made in appropriate cases for procedures performed in the inpatient hospital setting using our technology Medicare generally reimburses hospitals in which the procedures are performed based upon prospectively determined amounts For hospital inpatient stays the prospective payment generally is determined by the patients condition and other patient data and procedures performed during the inpatient stay using a classification system known as International Classification of Diseases or ICD and medical severity diagnosisrelated groups or MS DRGs Prospective rates are adjusted for among other things regional differences comorbidity and complications Hospitals performing inpatient procedures using our devices generally do not receive separate Medicare reimbursement for the specific costs of purchasing or implanting our products Rather reimbursement for these costs is bundled with the MS DRGbased payments made to hospitals for the procedures during which our devices are implanted removed or replaced Because prospective payments are based on predetermined rates and may be less than a hospitals actual costs in furnishing care hospitals have incentives to lower their inpatient operating costs by utilizing products devices and supplies that will reduce the length of inpatient stays decrease labor or otherwise lower their costs Thus hospitals may decide not to use our products if reimbursement amounts are insufficient to cover any additional costs incurred when purchasing our products Coverage and reimbursement for procedures to implant remove or replace our products are generally established in the US market For instance Medicare covers the use of LVADs when used for support of blood circulation postcardiotomy as a temporary lifesupport system until a human heart becomes available for transplant or as destination therapy for patients who require permanent mechanical cardiac support when the use is consistent with FDA approval and FDAapproved labeling instructions as applicable Coverage and reimbursement for procedures to implant the Impella 25 Impella CP Impella 50 Impella LD Impella 55 and Impella RP devices are also established for inhospital use by Medicare including ICD10 for procedures and MS DRG coding Actual coverage and payment may vary by local Medicare fiscal intermediary or thirdparty insurer Our Impella devices are also covered by commercial andor Medicare plans of many thirdparty insurers including Aetna Humana Cigna Blue Cross Blue Shield and United Healthcare In August 2019 the CMS released final Medicare payment levels for inpatient hospital discharges for fiscal year 2020 October 1 2019 through September 30 2020 The Final Rule for the IPPS update includes ICD10 coding and maintained assignment of percutaneous Impella implantation to MSDRG 215 for Other Heart Assist System Implant biventricular Impella support in MSDRG and Impella hospital transfer and support in MSDRG 268 for the receiving hospital CMS eliminated the proposed reduction of 27 and concluded there was no reduction versus the prior year for MSDRG 215 The Final Rule was effective for the 12 months from and after October 1 2019 for all Medicare hospital inpatient discharges 8 In May 2020 the CMS released a draft of hospital payment levels proposed for patient discharges after October 1 2020 The May 2020 proposed rule or the Proposed Rule for the IPPS update includes ICD10 coding and confirms assignment of percutaneous Impella implantation to MSDRG 215 for Other Heart Assist System Implant The Proposed Rule also maintained biventricular Impella MSDRG 1 ECPella MSDRG 3 and Impella hospital transfer  support MSDRG 268 for the receiving hospital In addition CMS proposed three payment rate options for MSDRG 215 including 1 fiscal year 2020 rate hold harmless 2 an average of the proposed rate and FY2020 rate or 3 adjust and audit reimbursement rate from FY2020 based on hospital charges length of stay patient transfer patient comorbidities and hospital efficiencies over the prior year Hospitals that incorporate best practices often achieve better patient outcomes at a lower cost of care For the sickest patients who utilize extensive resources hospitals are eligible to receive additional outlier payments which may collectively increase reimbursement in future years The AHA and CMS have established a system of care around the utilization of percutaneous heart pumps The history and creation of this dedicated payment system with Impella implantexplant biventricular ECPella and transfer reimbursement allows some of the most critically ill patients in the system to have the potential to survive and improveachieve native heart recovery The MSDRG 215 proposed rate is lower than that of the previous year based on the CMS process to evaluate hospital charges length of stay patient comorbidities taking into account hospital efficiencies over the prior year The Proposed Rule for the IPPS is open for public comment until July 10 2020 The final rulemaking may differ substantially from this proposal and will take effect for the year beginning October 1 2020 In addition to payments to hospitals for procedures using our technology Medicare makes separate payments to physicians for their professional services when they perform surgeries to implant remove replace or repair our devices or when they perform percutaneous insertion and removal of Impella devices Physicians generally bill for such services using a coding system known as Current Procedural Terminology or CPT codes Physician services performed in connection with the implantation removal or repositioning of our approved products are billed using a variety of CPT codes Generally Medicare payment levels for physician services are based on the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule and are revised annually by CMS Physicians may choose not to use our products if reimbursement amounts do not justify the additional costs expended when employing our products In general thirdparty reimbursement programs in the US and abroad whether governmentfunded or commercially insured are developing a variety of increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs including prospective reimbursement and capitation programs group purchasing reducing benefit coverage requiring second opinions prior to major surgery negotiating reductions to charges on patient bills promoting healthier lifestyle initiatives and exploring more costeffective methods of delivering healthcare These types of cost containment programs as well as legislative or regulatory changes to reimbursement policies could limit the amount which healthcare providers may be willing to pay for our medical devices Government Regulation and Other Matters Our products and facilities are subject to regulation by numerous government agencies including the FDA European Community Notified Bodies and the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency to confirm compliance with the various laws and regulations governing the development testing manufacturing labeling marketing and distribution of our products We are also governed by federal state local and international laws of general applicability such as those regulating employee health and safety and the protection of the environment Overall the amount and scope of domestic and foreign laws and regulations applicable to our business has increased over time United States Regulation In the US the FDA has responsibility for regulating medical devices under the authority of the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act or FFDCA The FDA regulates design development testing clinical studies manufacturing labeling distribution import export sale promotion and record keeping for medical devices and reporting of adverse events recalls or other field actions by manufacturers and users to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices Many of the devices that we develop manufacture and market are in a category for which the FDA has implemented stringent clinical investigation and premarket clearance or approval requirements The process of obtaining FDA clearance or approval to market a product is resource intensive lengthy and costly FDA review may involve delays that adversely affect the marketing and sale of our products Some our products are pending regulatory clearance or approval to begin commercial sales in various markets Ultimately the FDA may not authorize the commercial release of a medical device if it determines the device is not safe and effective or does not meet other standards for clearance or approval Additionally even if a product is cleared or approved the FDA may impose restrictions requiring postmarket testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effects of these products once commercialized 9 The FDA has the authority to halt the distribution of certain medical devices detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices order the repair replacement or refund of the costs of such devices or preclude the importation of devices that are or appear to be violative The FDA also conducts inspections to determine compliance with the QSR concerning the manufacturing and design of devices and medical device reporting regulations recall regulations clinical testing regulations and other requirements The FDA may withdraw product clearances or approvals due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval and require notification of health professionals and others with regard to medical devices that present unreasonable risks of harm to the public health Additionally the failure to comply with FDA or comparable regulatory standards or the discovery of previously unknown product problems could result in fines delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances or approvals seizures injunctions recalls refunds civil money penalties or criminal prosecution Our compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review Moreover the FDA and several other US agencies administer controls over the export of medical devices from the US and the import of devices into the US which could also subject us to sanctions for noncompliance Premarket Regulation The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes Class I II or III based on the statutory framework described in the FFDCA Our Impella products are categorized as Class III devices Class III devices are typically lifesustaining lifesupporting or implantable devices or new devices that have not been found to be substantially equivalent to legally marketed devices Class III devices must generally receive PMA approval from the FDA before they can be marketed The PMA approval pathway requires that the applicant demonstrate to the FDAs satisfaction based on valid scientific evidence that there is a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use During the PMA process the FDA examines detailed data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the device This information includes design development manufacture labeling advertising preclinical testing and clinical study data Prior to approving a PMA the FDA may conduct an inspection of the manufacturing facilities and the clinical sites where supporting studies were conducted The facility inspection evaluates our compliance with QSR An inspection of clinical sites evaluates compliance with good clinical practice standards including for studies conducted under an investigational device exemption or IDE that the studies meet the requirements of FDAs IDE regulations Typically the FDA will convene an advisory panel meeting to review the data presented in the PMA The panels recommendation is given substantial weight but is not binding on the FDA Under a set of performance measures that the FDA has committed to achieving in return for the receipt of user fees from manufacturers FDA attempts to review all PMAs not requiring an advisory panel meeting within 180 FDA days and review of a PMA application that does require an advisory panel meeting within 320 FDA days The term FDA days excludes the time the applicant spends responding to FDA requests for additional information While the FDA has approved PMA applications within the allotted time period reviews can occur over a significantly longer period Upon completion of its review the FDA will either approve or deny the PMA If the FDAs evaluation is favorable the PMA is approved and the device may be marketed in the US The FDA may approve a PMA with postapproval conditions such as postmarket collection of clinical data Failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in material adverse enforcement action including the loss or withdrawal of the PMA approval A PMA approval may include significant limitations on the indicated uses for which a device may be marketed The FDA interprets the FFDCA as prohibiting the promotion of approved medical devices for unapproved uses After approval of a PMA a new PMA or PMA supplement is required in the event of a significant modification to the device the device labeling or the manufacturing process The FDA can initiate proceedings to withdraw a PMA approval for failure to comply with regulatory requirements or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial marketing See Item 1 Business  Our Products for additional information regarding regulatory approvals on our Impella devices We expect to make additional PMA supplement submissions for additional indications for use for our Impella devices in the future When clinical trials of a device are required in order to obtain FDA approval the sponsor of the trial is generally required to file an IDE application before commencing the trials The FDA reviews and must approve an IDE before a clinical study may begin in the US In addition the clinical study must be approved by an Institutional Review Board or IRB at each clinical site The FDA the IRB or we may suspend a clinical trial at any time for various reasons including if information emerges suggesting that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk All clinical studies of investigational devices must be conducted in compliance with FDA requirements Following the completion of a study the data from the study must be collected analyzed and presented in an appropriate submission to the FDA either as a report submitted to the IDE file or in a marketing application such as a PMA 10 In addition certain medical devices can be approved by the FDA in the US under an HDE rather than a PMA In order for a device to be eligible for an HDE there must be a qualifying target patient population of less than 8000 patients per year for which there is no other comparable device available to treat the condition The FDA must agree that a device meets these criteria before it can be approved under an HDE FDA approval of an HDE also requires demonstration that the device is safe for its intended application that it is potentially effective and that the probable benefits outweigh the associated risks If another device receives approval through the PMA process that addresses the same patient population as the HDE device the HDE device may need to be withdrawn from the US market An approved HDE authorizes sales of the device to any hospital after review and approval by the hospitals IRB Proposed modifications to approved HDE devices like modifications to approved PMA devices require FDA approval through a new HDE application or an HDE supplement Postmarket Regulation The medical devices that we manufacture and distribute pursuant to regulatory clearances or approvals by the FDA and other countries regulatory authorities are subject to continuing regulation by those agencies The FDA reviews design manufacturing and distribution practices labeling and record keeping and manufacturers required reports of adverse experience and other information to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices Among other FDA requirements we must comply with the FDAs good manufacturing practice regulations for medical devices known as the QSR These regulations govern the methods used in and the facilities and controls used for the design testing manufacture packaging labeling storage installation and servicing of all finished medical devices intended for human use We must also comply with Medical Device Reporting or MDR requirements which require us to report to the FDA any incident in any of our products that may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury including medical intervention to prevent a death or serious injury or in which any of our products malfunctioned and if such malfunction were to recur would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury Labeling advertising and promotional activities are subject to scrutiny by the FDA and in certain circumstances by the Federal Trade Commission The FDAs enforcement policy prohibits the marketing of approved medical devices for unapproved uses We are subject to routine inspection by the FDA for compliance with the QSR and MDR requirements as well as other applicable regulations If the FDA were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations or that any of our medical devices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk the FDA could ban such medical devices detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices order a recall repair replacement or refund of such devices and require us to notify health professionals and others that the devices present unreasonable risks of harm to the public health The FDA may also seek a judicial injunction enjoining certain violations of the FFDCA and imposing operating restrictions and assess civil or criminal fines and penalties against our officers employees or us The FDA may also recommend criminal prosecution to the US Department of Justice Conduct giving rise to civil or criminal penalties may also form the basis for private civil litigation by thirdparty payers or other persons allegedly harmed by our conduct Regulatory authorities outside the US enforce similar laws and regulations within their respective jurisdictions The FDA and other regulatory agencies actively enforce regulations prohibiting promotion of offlabel uses and the promotion of products for which marketing clearance has not been obtained If the FDA or another regulatory agency determines that our promotional materials or training constitutes promotion of an unapproved use it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory enforcement actions including the issuance of a warning letter injunction seizure civil fine and criminal penalties Although our policy is to refrain from statements that could be considered offlabel promotion of our products the FDA or another regulatory agency could disagree and conclude that we have engaged in offlabel promotion The FDA can require postmarket surveillance or PMS for significant risk devices such as our medical devices that require ongoing collection analysis and periodic submission to the FDA of clinical data during commercialization over a period of up to several years The PMS data collection requirements are often burdensome and expensive The failure to comply with the FDAs regulations can result in enforcement action including seizure of products injunction prosecution civil fines and penalties recall andor suspension of FDA approval The FDA in cooperation with US Customs and Border Protection or CBP administers controls over the import and export of medical devices into and out of the US International sales of our medical devices that have not received FDA approval are therefore subject to FDA export requirements The CBP imposes its own regulatory requirements on the import of medical devices including inspection and possible sanctions for noncompliance 11 Other Regulations We are subject to additional laws and regulations that govern our business operations products and technologies including  federal state and foreign antikickback laws and regulations which generally prohibit payments and other financial benefits to physicians or other purchasers of medical products as an inducement to purchase a product  the Stark law which prohibits physicians from referring Medicare patients to a provider that bills this program for the provision of certain designated health services if the physician or a member of the physicians immediate family has a financial relationship with that provider subject to numerous specific exemptions  federal and state laws and regulations that protect the confidentiality and security of certain patient health information including patient records and restrict the use and disclosure of such information in particular the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 or HIPAA  domestic and foreign laws and regulations that protect personal data such as the European Unions General Data Protection Regulation or the GDPR that require among other things consent to process personal data of individuals disclosures to individuals regarding the processing of personal data the security and confidentiality of personal data and notification in the event of data breaches  the Physician Payments Sunshine Act or PPSA which requires public disclosure of the financial relationships of US physicians and teaching hospitals with applicable manufacturers including medical device pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  the False Claims Act or FCA which prohibits the submission of false or otherwise improper claims for payment to a federally funded health care program and health care fraud statutes that prohibit false statements and improper claims to any thirdparty payer and may be enforced through whistleblower or qui tam lawsuits filed by private individuals and  the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 as amended or FCPA which can be used to prosecute companies in the US for arrangements with foreign government officials or other parties outside the US Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in criminal liability significant fines or penalties negative publicity and material costs and expenses associated with investigation enforcement activities and individual settlement agreements that impose a government monitor for a period of several years We are also subject to various local state federal and international laws and regulations relating to such matters as safe working conditions laboratory and manufacturing practices and the use handling and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances used in connection with our research and development and manufacturing activities Specifically the manufacture of our biomaterials is subject to compliance with federal environmental regulations and by various state and local agencies We believe we have been and we are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations including environmental laws and regulations We currently have no liabilities under such requirements that could reasonably be expected to materially harm our business results of operations or financial condition International Regulation Internationally the approval and regulation of medical devices is subject to a variety of laws and regulation In Europe our products are subject to extensive regulatory requirements Our Impella 25 Impella CP Impella 50 Impella LD Impella 55 Impella RP and Impella AIC are all approved under CE Mark and are available for sale in the European Union and other markets that recognize CE Mark approval The European Union requires that medical devices may only be placed on the market if they do not compromise safety and health when properly installed maintained and used in accordance with their intended purpose National laws conforming to the European Unions legislation regulate our products under the medical devices regulatory system Although the more variable national requirements under which medical devices were formerly regulated have been substantially replaced by the European Union Medical Devices Directive individual nations can still impose unique requirements that may require supplemental submissions The European Union medical device laws require manufacturers to declare that their products conform to the essential regulatory requirements after which the products may be placed on the market bearing the CE Mark Manufacturers quality systems for products in all but the lowest risk classification are also subject to certification and audit by an independent notified body In Europe particular emphasis is being placed on more sophisticated and faster procedures for the reporting of adverse events to the competent authorities 12 In May 2017 the European Union implemented a new regulatory requirement for medical devices under the Medical Device Regulation  The Medical Device Regulation becomes fully effective in fiscal 2021 and will bring significant new requirements for many medical devices including enhanced requirements for clinical evidence and documentation increased focus on device identification and traceability new definitions and registration of economic operators throughout the distribution chain and additional post market surveillance and vigilance Compliance with the Medical Device Regulation will require recertification of many of our products to the enhanced standards In Japan premarket approval and clinical studies are required as is governmental pricing approval for medical devices Our Impella 25 Impella CP Impella 50 and Impella AIC have regulatory approval and are available for sale in Japan Clinical studies are subject to a stringent Good Clinical Practices standard Approval time frames from the Japanese MHLW vary from simple notifications to review periods of one or more years depending on the complexity and risk level of the device In addition importation of medical devices into Japan is subject to the Good Import Practices regulations As with any highly regulated market significant changes in the regulatory environment could adversely affect future sales In many of the other foreign countries in which we market our products we may be subject to regulations affecting among other things  product standards and specifications  packaging requirements  labeling requirements  marketing restrictions  product collection and disposal requirements  quality system requirements  import restrictions  tariffs  customs and duties and  tax requirements Many of the regulations applicable to our devices and products in these countries are similar to those of the FDA In some countries the level of government regulation of medical devices is increasing which can lengthen time to market and increase registration and approval costs In many countries the national health or social security organizations require our products to be qualified before they can be marketed and considered eligible for reimbursement Health Care Initiatives Government and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of health care costs including price regulation and competitive pricing coverage and payment policies comparative effectiveness reviews technology assessments and managedcare arrangements are continuing in many countries where we do business including the US Canada Europe and Asia As a result of these changes the marketplace has placed increased emphasis on the delivery of more costeffective medical therapies For example government programs private health care insurance and managedcare plans have attempted to control costs by restricting coverage and limiting the level of reimbursement for procedures or treatments and some thirdparty payers require their preapproval before new or innovative devices or therapies are utilized by patients These various initiatives have created increased price sensitivity over medical products generally and may impact demand for our products and technologies The delivery of our products is subject to regulation by the department of Health and Human Services in the US and comparable state and foreign agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of health care items and services Foreign governments also impose regulations in connection with their health care reimbursement programs and the delivery of health care items and services Reimbursement schedules regulate the amount the US government will reimburse hospitals and doctors for the inpatient care of persons covered by Medicare CMS may also review whether andor under what circumstances a procedure or technology is reimbursable for Medicare beneficiaries Changes in current reimbursement levels could have an adverse effect on market demand and our pricing flexibility 13 Health care cost containment efforts have also prompted domestic hospitals and other customers of medical device manufacturers to consolidate into larger purchasing groups to enhance purchasing power and this trend is expected to continue The medical device industry has also experienced some consolidation partly in order to offer a broader range of products to large purchasers As a result transactions with customers are larger more complex and could likely involve more longterm contracts than in the past These larger customers due to their enhanced purchasing power may attempt to increase pressure on product pricing Health Care Reform In March 2010 the US Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act or together the Affordable Care Act or ACA The law includes provisions that among other things reduce or limit Medicare reimbursement and impose increased taxes In December 2015 the Consolidated Appropriations Act 2016 was signed into law which included a twoyear moratorium on the medical device excise tax such that medical device sales in 2016 and 2017 were exempt from the medical device excise tax In January 2018 this medical device excise tax moratorium was further extended until January 1 2020 The Further Consolidated Appropriations Act was signed into law on December 20 2019 and fully repealed the medical device excise tax previously imposed As a result of the repeal sales of taxable medical devices after December 31 2015 are not subject to the medical device excise tax With the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017 the ACAs former individual mandate penalty for not having health insurance coverage has been eliminated Initiatives to repeal the ACA in whole or in part to delay implementation or funding and to offer amendments or supplements to modify its provisions have been persistent and have increased as a result of the 2016 election Efforts to pass comprehensive repeal legislation have failed but in light of the stated policies of the US executive administration and actions of certain members of the US Congress the outlook for ACAcompliant insurance plans is still uncertain The current US executive administration has encouraged certain alternative health plans that are not required to comply with ACA coverage standards including shortterm and association health plans If these plans become more widespread premiums for the more comprehensive plans required by the ACA may increase which could result in a decrease in the number of Americans with comprehensive health care insurance While any legislative and regulatory changes will likely take time to develop and may or may not have an impact on the regulatory regime to which we are subject we cannot predict the ultimate content timing or effect of any healthcare reform legislation or the impact of potential legislation on us Seasonality Our quarterly net sales are influenced by many factors including new product introductions acquisitions regulatory approvals patient and physician holiday schedules and other factors Net sales in the first half of our fiscal year were 49 47 and 45 of total fiscal year net sales for fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively Historically our revenues have generally been lower in the first half of our fiscal year due to the seasonality of the US European and Japanese markets where summer vacation schedules normally result in fewer medical procedures for our products Employees As of March 31 2020 we had 1536 fulltime employees including  275 in product engineering research and development clinical development and regulatory  643 in sales clinical support marketing field service and related support 518 of whom are in the US and Canada 70 of whom are in Europe and 55 of whom are in Asia  464 in manufacturing and  154 in general and administration We routinely enter into contractual agreements with our employees which typically include confidentiality and noncompetition commitments Our employees are not represented by unions We consider our employee relations to be good 14 ITEM 1A RI SK FACTORS You should carefully consider the following risks and all other information set forth in this report including without limitation our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto and Part II Item 7 Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The risks and uncertainties we have described are not the only ones we face If any of these risks materialize the trading price of our common stock could fall and you could lose all or part of your investment Risks Related to Our Business A pandemic epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease such as COVID19 may materially and adversely impact our business our operations and our financial results In recent months a new strain of coronavirus COVID19 has spread to many countries in the world and the outbreak has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization The US Secretary of Health and Human Services has also declared a public health emergency in the US in response to the outbreak Considerable uncertainty still surrounds the COVID19 virus and its potential effects and the extent of and effectiveness of responses taken on international national and local levels Measures taken to limit the impact of COVID19 including shelterinplace orders social distancing measures travel bans and restrictions and business and government shutdowns have already resulted in significant negative economic impacts on a global basis As the coronavirus pandemic continues to rapidly evolve we cannot at this time accurately predict the effects of these conditions on our operations Uncertainties remain as to the ultimate geographic spread of the virus the severity of the disease the duration of the outbreak and the length and scope of the travel restrictions and business closures imposed by the governments of impacted countries The continued outbreak of COVID19 or another infectious disease with similar characteristics may lead to the implementation of further responses including additional travel restrictions governmentimposed quarantines or stayathome orders and other public health safety measures which may result in further disruptions to our business and operations The COVID19 outbreak has had an impact on our business and a continuing outbreak or future outbreaks may have several adverse effects on our business results of operations and financial condition  Decreased demand for our products Medical authorities globally including the US Surgeon General the American College of Surgeons and the UK National Health Service have advised the deferral of elective medical procedures and many hospitals have cancelled or postponed elective medical procedures and may continue to do so Due to these impacts and measures we have experienced and may continue to experience significant and unpredictable reductions in the demand for our products as healthcare customers divert medical resources and priorities towards the treatment of COVID19 In addition our customers may delay cancel or redirect planned purchases in order to focus resources on COVID19 or in response to economic disruption related to COVID19 For example beginning in midMarch 2020 and continuing into the first quarter of fiscal 2021 we have experienced a significant decline in patient utilization in the US Europe and Japan as healthcare systems have diverted resources to meet the increasing demands of managing COVID19 In addition public health bodies have recommended delaying elective medical procedures during the COVID19 pandemic which may continue to negatively impact the usage of our products including the number of Impella heart pump procedures For more information on the impact on our financial results for the fourth quarter of 2020 and other related financial results as well as our expectations for future financial results see Part II Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsCOVID19 Pandemic Because outbreaks of infectious diseases like COVID19 have been shown to burden healthcare systems due to the high volume of infected patients hospitals and physicians may also resort to expensereducing measures in other areas of healthcare practice including after an outbreak subsides Our customers may decline to schedule future procedures utilizing our products which would negatively impact our operations and financial results There may also be a decrease in the number of emergency procedures using our products if patients avoid hospital settings during an infectious disease outbreak  Decreased education and training of customers Our opportunities to educate potential customers about our products or to train existing customers in the use of our products have been and may continue to be less frequent or less effective Extended social distancing measures have prevented and may continue to prevent our sales clinical support marketing field service and related support personnel from attending inperson education and training events and from entering the cath labs where our product is being used 15  Reduced product development We may face decreased ability to test developing products in clinical trials where COVID19 is not an exclusion factor or where a patients COVID19 status is unknown Regulatory oversight and actions regarding our products may be disrupted or delayed in regions impacted by COVID19 including the US and Europe which may impact review and approval timelines for products in development andor changes to existing products that need regulatory review and approval At the end of March 2020 we temporarily paused new enrollments in our active clinical trial s in response to the COVID19 response around the globe Additionally although we remain invested in innovation our efforts in product engineering and research and development may be impacted if our employees in those areas are advised to continue to work remotely as part of social distancing measures Regulatory oversight and actions regarding our products may be disrupted or delayed in regions impacted by COVID19 including the US and Europe which may impact review and approval timelines for products in development andor changes to existing products that need regulatory review and approval Additionally although we remain invested in innovation our efforts in product engineering and research and development may be impacted if our employees in those areas are advised to continue to work remotely as part of social distancing measures  Negative impacts on our suppliers and employees  COVID19 or similar infectious diseases may impact the health of our employees directors suppliers or customers reduce the availability of our workforce or those of companies with which we do business divert our attention toward succession planning or create disruptions in our supply or distribution networks Although our supply of raw materials and distribution of finished products remain operational with no known or foreseen constraints and we have not closed any of our manufacturing plants we may experience adverse effects of such events on us which may limit our ability to manufacture our products and may include a significant disruption to our supply chain our operations For information on certain financial management measures we took in response to the effects of COVID19 see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsCOVID19 Pandemic Additionally having shifted to remote working arrangements we also face a heightened risk of cybersecurity attacks or data security incidents and are more dependent on internet and telecommunications access and capabilities COVID19 has also created significant disruption to and volatility in national regional and local economies and markets Uncertainties related to and perceived or experienced negative effects from COVID19 may cause significant volatility or decline in the trading price of our securities capital market conditions and general economic environment Our future results of operations and liquidity could be adversely impacted by delays in payments of outstanding receivable amounts beyond normal payment terms supply chain disruptions and operational challenges faced by our customers Continued outbreaks of COVID19 or a significant outbreak of contagious diseases in the human population could result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries resulting in a further economic downturn or a global recession that could affect demand for our products and likely impact our operating results These may increase the likelihood of litigation including derivative stockholder litigation limit or restrict our ability to access capital on favorable terms or at all lead to consolidation that negatively impacts our business weaken demand increase competition cause us to reduce our capital spend further or otherwise disrupt our business or make it more difficult to implement our strategic plans A prolonged downturn in global economic conditions may materially adversely affect our business Our business and results of operations are affected by international national and regional economic conditions Financial markets in the US Europe and Asia have been experiencing extreme disruption in recent months including among other things extreme volatility in securities prices We are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of the current disruptions in financial markets and adverse economic conditions throughout the world These economic developments affect businesses such as ours and those of our customers in a number of ways that could result in unfavorable consequences to us Current economic conditions or a deepening economic downturn in the US and elsewhere including as a result of a continued or future outbreak of COVID19 or a similar infectious disease or reductions in the level of government funding for scientific research may cause our current or potential customers to delay or reduce purchases which could in turn result in reductions in sales of our products materially and adversely affecting our results of operations and cash flows Volatility and disruption of global financial markets could limit our customers ability to obtain adequate financing to maintain operations and proceed with planned or new capital spending initiatives leading to a reduction in sales volume that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow In addition a decline in our customers ability to pay as a result of the economic downturn may lead to increased difficulties in the collection of our accounts receivable higher levels of reserves for doubtful accounts and writeoffs of accounts receivable and higher operating costs as a percentage of revenues 16 We depend on Impella  products and services for most of our revenues We derive and expect to continue to derive in the near future most of our revenues from sales of our Impella devices and related services While we cannot fully predict what level of revenues our Impella devices will generate we anticipate that Impella revenues will continue to account for most of our revenues in the near future Implementation of our business strategy depends on continued revenues from of our Impella devices and services Our ability to generate revenues from our Impella devices and services may be impaired by the factors described below  our failure to obtain approvals from the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities or to comply with government regulations or the withdrawal of market clearance or the taking of other enforcement actions that could limit or impair our ability to sell our products  announcements by the FDA relating to our products and their impact on market perception of our product including shortterm impact  lack of acceptance or continued acceptance by physicians hospitals or patients  our reliance on specialized suppliers for certain components and materials  manufacturing or quality control issues  reputational risk relating to customer reviews of our products  our inability to protect our proprietary technologies or an infringement of others patents  the loss of a distributor or a distributors failure to perform its obligations  our failure to compete successfully against our existing or potential competitors  additional risks associated with selling in international markets  long and variable sales and deployment cycles  failure by thirdparty payers to provide appropriate levels of reimbursement for hospitals and physicians using our products  our failure to comply with federal and state regulations and  product liability claims If we fail to compete successfully against our existing or potential competitors our revenues or operating results may be harmed Competition from other companies offering circulatory care products is intense and subject to rapid technological change and evolving industry requirements and standards We compete with companies that have greater financial product development sales and marketing resources and experience than we do Our ability to compete effectively depends upon our ability to distinguish our company and our products from our competitors and their products Factors affecting our competitive position include  the availability of other products and procedures that are technically equivalent or superior to our products and which may be sold at lower prices  product performance and design  product safety  sales marketing and distribution capabilities  comparable clinical outcomes  our ability to complete clinical trials and regulatory approval processes  success and timing of new product development and introductions  physician and hospital acceptance of our products and the amount of time to convert physicians and hospitals into users of our products  reimbursement approval from health care insurance providers and the costeffectiveness of these reimbursements to our hospital customers  our ability to integrate potential acquired businesses into our operations 17  penetration into existing and new geographic markets and  intellectual property protection Our customers are primarily hospitals that have limited budgets Physicians endorse our products to hospitals that will then choose to purchase our products and subsequently pass this cost on to patients or their insurance providers Physicians will recommend our products based on public information regarding patient outcomes clinical trials and the costs and benefits of using our products when compared to other substitutes available in the market As a result our products compete against a broad range of medical devices and other therapies for these limited funds Our success will depend in large part upon our ability to enhance our existing products to develop new products to meet regulatory and customer requirements and to achieve and maintain market acceptance for our products We believe that important competitive factors with respect to the development and commercialization of our products include the relative speed with which we can develop products establish clinical utility complete clinical trials and regulatory approval processes obtain and protect reimbursement maintain cost effectiveness for our products and supply commercial quantities of our products to our customers Advances in medical technology biotechnology and pharmaceuticals may reduce the size of the potential markets for our products or render our products obsolete We are aware of other cardiac assist device research efforts in the US Canada Europe and Japan In addition there are a number of companies including Abbott Laboratories Medtronic Edwards Lifesciences CardiacAssist Terumo Heart Teleflex Getinge Maquet Cardiovascular and several earlystage companies that are developing heart assist products including implantable left ventricular assist devices and miniaturized rotary ventricular assist devices that directly and indirectly compete with our products The commercial success of our products will require acceptance by cardiac surgeons and interventional cardiologists a limited number of whom have significant influence over medical device selection and purchasing decisions We may achieve our business objectives only if our products are accepted and recommended by leading cardiac surgeons and interventional cardiologists whose decisions are likely to be based on a determination that our products are safe and effective and represent acceptable costeffective methods of treatment in light of reimbursement policies with respect to our products Although we have developed relationships with leading cardiac surgeons the commercial success of Impella devices and our other products will also require that we develop relationships with leading interventional cardiologists in cath labs We cannot assure you that we can maintain our existing relationships and arrangements with leading cardiac surgeons or interventional cardiologists or that we can establish new relationships in support of our products If cardiac surgeons and interventional cardiologists do not consider our products to be adequate for the treatment of our target cardiac patient population or if a sufficient number of these clinicians recommend and use competing products it would seriously harm our business Expansion into hospital cardiac centers that have not historically used our products may incur long sales and training cycles that may cause our revenues and operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter Our products have lengthy sales cycles and we may incur substantial sales and marketing expenses and expend significant effort without making a sale We sell primarily to hospitals that often have administrative requirements to introduce and expand a new technology such as Impella devices at their sites Even after making the decision to purchase our Impella devices our customers often deploy our products slowly or infrequently In addition cardiac centers of hospitals that buy the majority of our products are usually led by cardiac surgeons who are heavily recruited by competing hospitals When one of these cardiac surgeons moves to a new hospital we sometimes experience a significant reduction in purchases by the hospital from which the physician has departed while it replaces the lead physician supporting our Impella devices As a result our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter In addition product purchases often lag behind initial expressions of interest in our product by new centers due to training and education regarding the use of the products Hospitals also need to perform internal administrative requirements prior to the initial implant procedures These challenges in our sales initiatives may be further adversely impacted by outbreaks of COVID19 or similar infectious diseases For more information see A pandemic epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease such as COVID19 or coronavirus may materially and adversely impact our business our operations and our financial results 18 The training required for clinicians to use our products could reduce the market acceptance of our products and reduce our revenue Clinicians must be trained to use our products proficiently It is critical to the success of our business that we ensure that there are a sufficient number of clinicians familiar with trained on and proficient in the use of our products Convincing clinicians to dedicate the time and energy necessary to obtain adequate training in the use of our products is challenging and we may not be successful in these efforts Our physician education and training initiatives may also be impaired by outbreaks of COVID19 or similar infectious diseases requiring social distancing If clinicians are not properly trained they may misuse or ineffectively use our products Any improper use of our products may result in unsatisfactory outcomes patient injury negative publicity or lawsuits against us any of which could harm our reputation and affect future product sales Furthermore our inability to educate and train clinicians to use our products may lead to lower demand for our products If we do not effectively manage our growth we may be unable to successfully develop market and sell our products Our future revenue and operating results will depend on our ability to manage the anticipated growth of our business We have experienced significant growth in recent years in which we have expanded our operations and we have increased our employee headcount This growth has placed significant demands on our management as well as our financial and operational resources In order to achieve our business objectives we will need to continue to grow However continued growth presents numerous challenges including  developing and retaining our global sales marketing and administrative infrastructure and capabilities  expanding manufacturing capacity maintaining quality and increasing production  increasing our foreign and domestic regulatory compliance capabilities  implementing appropriate operational financial and IT systems and internal controls  impact of the COVID19 pandemic and related remote working arrangements on our ability to support our customers  identifying attracting and retaining qualified personnel particularly experienced clinical staff and  hiring training managing and supervising our personnel worldwide Any failure to manage our growth effectively could impede our ability to successfully develop market and sell our products which could seriously harm our business The demand for our existing products and products under development is unproven and we may be unable to successfully commercialize our products Our existing products which have received regulatory approval for commercialization only in the last few years and our products under development may not enjoy commercial acceptance or success thus adversely affecting our business and operational results We need to create new indications and geographic markets for our Impella devices and other existing products as well as other new or future products including achieving market acceptance among physicians hospitals patients and thirdparty payers In particular we must gain and maintain acceptance of our Impella devices among interventional cardiologists and cardiac surgeons The obstacles we will face in trying to create successful commercial markets for our products include  limitations inherent in firstgeneration devices and our potential inability to develop successive improvements including increases in service life and improvements in the ease of use of our products  introduction by other companies of new treatments products and technologies that compete with our products  willingness of physicians to recommend the use of our product  timing and amount of reimbursement for these products if any by thirdparty payers and the costeffectiveness of using our products by our customers given these reimbursement considerations  potential reluctance of clinicians and hospitals to obtain and support adequate training to use our products  cost of our products and  potential reluctance of physicians patients hospitals and society as a whole to accept medical devices that replace or assist the heart and risk of mechanical failure inherent in such devices 19 Several of these obstacles may be further exacerbated by outbreaks of COVID19 or similar infectious diseases For more information see A pandemic epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease such as COVID19 or coronavirus may materially and adversely impact our business our operations and our financial results If we fail to obtain and maintain necessary governmental approvals for our products and indications we may be unable to market and sell our products in certain jurisdictions Medical devices such as ours are extensively regulated by the FDA in the US and by other federal state local and foreign authorities Governmental regulations relate to the testing development manufacturing labeling design sale promotion distribution importing exporting and shipping of our products In the US before we can market a new medical device or a new use of or claim for or significant modification to an existing product we must generally first receive PMA from the FDA This process can be expensive and lengthy and can entail significant expenses primarily related to clinical trials It generally takes between one to three years to receive approval or even longer from the time the PMA application is submitted to the FDA Regulatory clearances or approvals either foreign or domestic may not be granted on a timely basis if at all If we are unable to obtain regulatory approvals or clearances for use of our products under development or if the patient populations for which they are approved are not sufficiently broad the commercial success of these products could be limited The FDA may also limit the claims that we can make about our products Any significant modifications to the design materials or intended use of those devices require FDA approval through PMA or HDE supplemental applications If we do not receive FDA approval for one or more of our products we will be unable to market and sell those products in the US which would have a material adverse effect on our operations and prospects We also market or are beginning to market our products in international markets including the European Union Canada and Japan Regulatory approval processes differ among those jurisdictions and approval in the US or any other single jurisdiction does not guarantee approval in any other jurisdiction Obtaining foreign approvals could involve significant delays difficulties and costs for us and could require additional clinical trials If the FDA or another regulatory or enforcement agency determines that we have promoted our products for one or more offlabel uses we may be subject to various penalties including civil or criminal penalties The FDA the US Department of Justice the Office of the Inspector General of Department of Health and Human Services and other regulatory or enforcement agencies actively enforce regulations prohibiting the promotion of unapproved medical devices and the promotion of otherwise approved or cleared medical devices for unapproved uses If any such agency determines that our promotional materials or training constitutes promotion of an unapproved use it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory enforcement actions including the issuance of a warning letter injunction recall or withdrawal seizure civil fine and criminal penalties Although our policy is to refrain from statements that could be considered offlabel promotion of our products such agencies could disagree and conclude that we have engaged in offlabel promotion To the extent a regulatory agency commences an investigation in the future we may not be able to resolve that matter without incurring penalties or facing significant consequences Even if we are successful in resolving such a matter without incurring penalties responding to a subpoena or other government inquiry could result in substantial costs and could significantly and adversely impact our reputation and divert managements attention and resources which could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results financial condition and ability to finance our operations Finally the ability of the FDA to review and clear or approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors including government budget and funding levels ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept the payment of user fees and statutory regulatory and policy changes This could affect our ability to develop or commercialize new products in a timely manner which could negatively impact our business Offlabel use of our products may result in injuries that lead to product liability suits which could be costly to our business The use of our products outside their approved indications for use or offlabel use may increase the risk of injury to patients Clinicians may use our products for offlabel uses as the FDA does not restrict or regulate a clinicians choice of treatment within the practice of medicine Offlabel use of our products may increase the risk of product liability claims against us Product liability claims are expensive to defend and could divert our managements attention and result in substantial damage awards against us 20 Unsuccessful clinical trials or procedures relating to products under development could have a material adverse effect on our prospects The regulatory approval process for new products and new indications for existing products often requires extensive clinical trials and procedures including early clinical feasibility studies Unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from current or future clinical trials or procedures conducted by us our competitors or third parties or perceptions regarding such clinical data whether or not true could adversely affect both our ability to obtain necessary approvals and the markets view of our future prospects Such clinical trials and procedures are inherently uncertain and there can be no assurance that these clinical trials or procedures will be completed in a timely or costeffective manner or result in a commercially viable product or expanded indication Failure to successfully complete these clinical trials or procedures in a timely and costeffective manner could have a material adverse effect on our prospects Clinical trials or procedures may experience significant setbacks even after earlier trials have shown promising results Further preliminary results from clinical trials or procedures may be contradicted by subsequent clinical analysis In addition results from our clinical trials or procedures may not be supported by actual longterm studies or clinical experience If preliminary clinical results are later contradicted or if initial results cannot be supported by actual longterm studies or clinical experience our business could be adversely affected Clinical trials or procedures may be delayed suspended or terminated by us the FDA or other regulatory authorities at any time if it is believed that the trial participants face unacceptable health risks or for numerous other reasons The FDA may disagree with our interpretation of the data from our clinical trials or may find the clinical trial design conduct or results inadequate to demonstrate safety and effectiveness of the product candidate The FDA may also require additional preclinical studies or clinical trials which could further delay approval of our products Our products are subject to extensive regulatory requirements including continuing regulatory review which could affect the manufacturing and marketing of our products The FDA and other regulatory agencies continue to review products even after they have received initial approval If and when the FDA or another regulatory agency clears or approves our products under development the manufacture and marketing of these products will be subject to continuing regulation postapproval clinical studies including compliance with the FDAs adverse event reporting requirements prohibitions on promoting a product for unapproved uses and Quality System Regulation or QSR requirements which obligate manufacturers including thirdparty and contract manufacturers to adhere to stringent design testing control documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the design and manufacture of a device Any modification to an FDA approved device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in its intended use requires a supplemental PMA or HDE approval The FDA requires each manufacturer to determine in the first instance whether a modification requires approval but the FDA may review and potentially disagree with any such decision Modifications of this type are common with new products We anticipate that the first generation of each of our products will undergo a number of changes refinements enhancements and improvements over time If the FDA requires us to seek approval for modification of a previously approved product for which we have concluded that new clearances or approvals are unnecessary we may be required to cease marketing or to recall the modified product until we obtain clearance or approval and we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and competitive position We also cannot assure you that we will be successful in obtaining clearances or approvals for our modifications if required We and our thirdparty suppliers of product components are also subject to inspection and market surveillance by the FDA and other regulatory agencies for QSR and other requirements the interpretation of which can change Compliance with QSR and similar legal requirements can be difficult and expensive While we continue to monitor our quality management in order to improve our overall level of compliance our facilities are subject to periodic and unannounced inspection by US and foreign regulatory agencies to audit compliance with the QSR and comparable foreign regulations Enforcement actions resulting from failure to comply with government requirements could result in fines suspensions of approvals or clearances recalls or seizure of products operating restrictions or shutdown and criminal prosecutions that could adversely affect the manufacture and marketing of our products The FDA or another regulatory agency could withdraw a previously approved product from the market upon receipt of newly discovered information including a failure to comply with regulatory requirements the occurrence of unanticipated safety problems of other defects in products following approval or other reasons which could adversely affect our operating results Even after receiving regulatory clearance or approval our products may be subject to product recalls which could harm our reputation and divert our managerial and financial resources The FDA and similar governmental authorities in other countries have the authority to order mandatory recall of our products or order their removal from the market if the government finds that our products might cause adverse health consequences or death A governmentmandated or voluntary recall by us could occur as a result of component failures manufacturing errors by us or our suppliers or design defects including labeling defects or unanticipated safety problems We have in the past initiated voluntary recalls for some of our products and we could do so in the future Any recall of our products may harm our reputation with customers and divert managerial and financial resources 21 Shutdowns of the US federal government could materially impair our business and financial condition Development of our product candidates andor regulatory approval may be delayed for reasons beyond our control For example over the last several years the US government has shut down several times and certain regulatory agencies such as the FDA CMS and the SEC have had to furlough their government employees and stop critical activities If a prolonged government shutdown or budget sequestration occurs it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA to timely review and process our regulatory submissions which could have a material adverse effect on our business Further in our operations as a public company future government shutdowns could impact our ability to communicate with the SEC on various topics such as shareholder proposals or to have our registration statements declared effective which could affect our ability to access the capital markets quickly We depend on thirdparty reimbursement to our customers for market acceptance of our products If thirdparty payers fail to provide coverage and appropriate levels of reimbursement for the medical procedures in which our products are used our sales and profitability would be adversely affected Sales of medical devices largely depend on the reimbursement of patients medical expenses by government healthcare programs and private health insurers Without the financial support of government reimbursement or thirdparty insurers payments for patient care the market for our products will be limited Medical products and devices incorporating new technologies are closely examined by governments and private insurers to determine whether the products and devices will be covered by reimbursement and if so the level of reimbursement which may apply In the US future action by the Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services or CMS which administers the Medicare program other government agencies or private payors may diminish payments to physicians outpatient surgery centers andor hospitals which could harm our ability to market and sell our products Private payors may adopt coverage decisions and payment amounts determined by CMS as guidelines in setting their coverage and reimbursement policies Private payors that do not follow the Medicare guidelines may adopt different coverage and reimbursement policies for procedures performed with our products In addition for governmental programs such as Medicaid coverage and reimbursement differs from state to state Medicaid payments to physicians and facilities are often lower than payments by other third party payors and some state Medicaid programs may not pay an adequate amount for the procedures performed with our products if any payment is made at all Internationally medical reimbursement systems vary significantly from country to country with some countries limiting medical centers spending through fixed budgets regardless of levels of patient treatment and other countries requiring application for and approval of government or thirdparty reimbursement For more information see Part I Item 1 BusinessThirdParty Reimbursement In addition thirdparty payers including private and government insurers are increasingly requiring evidence that medical devices are costeffective If we are unable to demonstrate that our devices are costeffective the thirdparty payer may not reimburse the use of our products which could reduce sales of our products to healthcare providers who depend upon reimbursement for payment We also cannot be sure that thirdparty payers will continue the current levels of reimbursement to physicians and medical centers for use of our products Any reduction in the amount of this reimbursement could harm our business Increasing awareness of healthcare costs public interest in healthcare reform and continuing pressure from Medicare Medicaid group purchasing organizations and other payers to reduce costs in the healthcare industry as well as increasing competition from other protective products could make it more difficult for us to sell our products at current prices Changes in healthcare reimbursement systems in the US and abroad could reduce our revenues and profitability In March 2010 the US federal government enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or ACA which made changes to the manner in which many healthcare services are provided and paid for in the US The ACA includes provisions that among other things reduce or limit Medicare reimbursement require all individuals to have health insurance with limited exceptions and impose increased taxes on certain companies and individuals Results of the recent US elections in 2016 have created a political environment in which significant portions of the ACA could be repealed or revised Recent tax reform legislation removed the financial penalty for individuals who do not have health insurance effective in 2019 a change that likely will result in fewer individuals electing to purchase health insurance In addition proposed changes in regulations would allow wider availability of health insurance that does not provide coverage for all of the essential health benefits required under the ACA It remains unclear what other portions of the ACA may remain or what any replacement or alternative programs may be created by any future legislation or regulation For example CMS has indicated that it intends to increase flexibility in state Medicaid programs including by expanding the scope of waivers under which states may implement Medicaid expansion provisions imposing different eligibility or enrollment restrictions or otherwise implementing programs that vary from federal standards 22 Any such future actions may have significant impact on the reimbursement for healthcare services generally including reducing significantly the number of individuals who have health insurance that can pay for our products which could lead our health care provider customers to be more cost conscious At the same time certain members of the US Congress have proposed measures that would expand the role of governmentsponsored coverage including single payer or socalled MedicareforAll proposals which could have farreaching implications for the healthcare industry if enacted Such a system could reduce our customers revenues such as Medicare and other public reimbursement rates on average could be lower than existing commercial health plan reimbursement rates Even if legislation creating such a singlepayer system is not enacted in the near term continued introduction of legislation promoting a singlepayer system by several members of the US Congress could increase uncertainty for our customers and cause them to delay purchases of our products and services Accordingly our business and results of operations could therefore be adversely affected by any future federal or state healthcare reform legislation or regulation In sum even if we succeed in bringing our new products to market uncertainties regarding future healthcare policy legislation and regulation as well as private market practices could affect our ability to sell our products in commercially acceptable quantities at profitable prices in certain countries We must comply with healthcare fraud and abuse laws and we could face penalties for noncompliance and be excluded from government healthcare programs which would adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations Certain federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse and patients rights may be applicable to our business We may be subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulation and patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business The laws and regulations that govern our business operations products and technologies and may affect our ability to operate include among others those listed in Part I Item 1 BusinessGovernment Regulation and Other MattersPostmarket Regulation To assist in our compliance efforts we must adhere to many codes of ethics and conduct regarding our sales and marketing activities in the US and other countries in which we operate Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in criminal liability significant fines or penalties negative publicity and substantial costs and expenses associated with investigation enforcement activities and individual settlement agreements that impose a government monitor for a period of several years We are subject to the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anticorruption laws as well as export control laws import and customs laws trade and economic sanctions laws and other laws governing our operations Our operations are subject to anticorruption laws including the FCPA the US domestic bribery statute contained in 18 USC 201 the US Travel Act and other anticorruption laws that apply in countries where we do business The FCPA and these other laws generally prohibit us and our employees and intermediaries from authorizing promising offering or providing directly or indirectly improper or prohibited payments or anything else of value to government officials or other persons to obtain or retain business or gain some other business advantage We and those acting on our behalf operate in a number of jurisdictions where companies in the medical device and life science industries are exposed to a high risk of potential FCPA violations associated with sales to healthcare professionals and institutions We participate in transactions with third parties whose corrupt or illegal activities could potentially subject us to liability under the FCPA or local anticorruption laws even if we do not explicitly authorize or have actual knowledge of such activities In addition we cannot predict the nature scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted Compliance with the FCPA and these other laws is expensive and difficult particularly in countries in which corruption is a recognized problem In addition anticorruption laws present particular challenges in the medical device industry because in many countries hospitals are operated by the government and doctors and other hospital employees are considered foreign officials Certain payments to hospitals in connection with clinical trials and other work have been deemed to be improper payments to government officials and have led to enforcement actions We are also subject to other laws and regulations governing our international operations There is no assurance that we will be completely effective in ensuring our compliance with all applicable anticorruption laws including the FCPA or other legal requirements If we are not in compliance with the FCPA and other anticorruption laws we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties disgorgement and other sanctions and remedial measures and legal expenses which could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and liquidity Likewise any investigation of any potential violations of the FCPA and other anticorruption laws could also have an adverse impact on our reputation our business results of operations and financial condition Further the failure to comply with laws governing international business practices may result in civil and criminal penalties and suspension or debarment from government contracting 23 Our future success depends in part on the development of new circulatory assist products and our development efforts may not be successful We are devoting most of our research and development and regulatory efforts and significant financial resources to the development of our Impella devices and product extensions of existing commercial products and new products The development of new products and product extensions presents enormous challenges in a variety of areas including blood compatible surfaces blood compatible flow manufacturing techniques pumping mechanisms physiological control energy transfer anatomical fit and surgical techniques We may be unable to overcome all of these challenges which could adversely affect our results of operations and prospects and limit our ability to bring new products to market or make changes to enhance existing commercial products If we are unable to develop additional highquality manufacturing capacity our growth may be limited and our business could be seriously harmed To be successful in the longterm we will need to increase our manufacturing capacity to support continued demand for our products We may encounter difficulties in scaling up manufacturing of our products including problems related to product yields quality control and assurance component and service availability dependable sources of supply adequacy of internal control policies and procedures and lack of skilled personnel Our manufacturing output may also be decreased by social distancing measures we implement in an effort to contain outbreaks of COVID19 or similar infectious diseases For more information see A pandemic epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease such as COVID19 or coronavirus may materially and adversely impact our business our operations and our financial results If we cannot hire train and retain enough experienced and capable scientific technical and manufacturing employees we may not be able to manufacture sufficient quantities of our existing or future products on time and at an acceptable cost which could limit market acceptance of our products or otherwise damage our business In order to meet the expected demand for our Impella devices we have continued to implement process improvements on the Impella production line at our manufacturing facilities in Aachen Germany and Danvers Massachusetts to increase the output that we can produce at the facility In addition to programs designed to further increase yield and capacity levels we have expanded manufacturing employment in recent years and increased manufacturing floor space in Danvers and Aachen We continue to work on initiatives to expand our Impella manufacturing capacity in both Aachen and Danvers We are also working with our existing suppliers and new suppliers to ensure we are able to have sufficient inventory as we increase our manufacturing capability to support growing demand We are and will continue outsourcing certain sub assembly production to thirdparty suppliers We are also working on process improvements such as certain automation techniques to allow us to manufacture our products more efficiently If we are unable to implement these process improvements on a timely basis in order to meet customer demand it could inhibit our revenue growth If a natural or manmade disaster strikes our manufacturing facilities we will be unable to manufacture our products for a substantial amount of time and our sales and profitability will decline Our facilities and the manufacturing equipment we use to produce our products would be costly to replace and could require substantial lead time to repair or replace The facilities may be affected by natural or manmade disasters and in the event they were affected by a disaster we would be forced to rely on thirdparty manufacturers Although we believe we possess adequate insurance for the disruption of our business from causalities such insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms or at all Any failure to achieve and maintain the high manufacturing standards that our products require may seriously harm our business Our products require precise highquality manufacturing Achieving precision and quality control requires skill and diligence by our personnel as well as our vendors Any failure to achieve and maintain these high manufacturing standards including the incidence of manufacturing errors design defects or component failures could result in patient injury or death product recalls or withdrawals delays or failures in product testing or delivery cost overruns or other problems that could seriously hurt our business Despite our very high manufacturing standards we cannot completely eliminate the risk of errors defects or failures If we or our vendors are unable to manufacture our products in accordance with necessary quality standards or if we are unable to procure additional highquality manufacturing facilities our business and results of operations may be negatively affected 24 If we cannot attract and retain key management scientific sales and other personnel we need we will not be successful We depend heavily on the contributions of the principal members of our business such as financial technical sales and support regulatory and clinical operating manufacturing and administrative management and staff many of whom would be difficult to replace Our key personnel include our senior officers many of whom have very specialized scientific medical or operational knowledge The loss of the service of any of the key members of our senior management team whether due to dismissal resignation or illness may significantly delay or prevent our achievement of our business objectives and divert remaining managements attention to seeking qualified replacements Our ability to attract train and retain qualified personnel consultants and advisors is critical to our success For example many members of our clinical staff are registered nurses with experience in the surgery suite or cath lab of which only a limited number of whom seek employment with a company like ours Competition for skilled and experienced personnel in the medical device industry is intense We face competition for skilled and experienced management scientific clinical engineering and sales personnel from numerous medical device and life sciences companies universities governmental entities and other research institutions Hiring efforts may also be compounded by intensified restrictions on travel including during the COVID  19 pandemic If we lose the services of any of the principal members of our management and staff and have not developed adequate succession plans or if we are unable to attract train and retain qualified personnel in the future especially scientific clinical and sales personnel our business could be adversely affected If our suppliers cannot provide the components we require our ability to manufacture our products could be harmed We rely on thirdparty suppliers to provide us with many of the components used in our existing products and products in development For example we outsource the manufacturing of most of our consoles other than final assembly and testing and the sterilization process for our products Relying on thirdparty suppliers makes us vulnerable to component part failures or obsolescence and interruptions in supply either of which could impair our ability to conduct clinical tests or to ship our products to our customers on a timely basis Using thirdparty vendors makes it difficult and sometimes impossible for us to test fully certain components such as components on circuit boards maintain quality control manage inventory and production schedules and control production costs Manufacturers of our product components may be required to comply with the FDA or other regulatory manufacturing regulations and to satisfy regulatory inspections in connection with the manufacture of the components Any failure by a supplier to comply with applicable requirements could lead to a disruption in supply Vendor lead times to supply us with ordered components vary significantly and often can exceed six months or more Both now and as we expand our manufacturing capacity we cannot be sure that our suppliers will furnish us required components when we need them or be able to provide us with sufficient inventory to support our expected growth in demand for our products Outbreaks of COVID19 or similar infectious diseases may also create disruptions in our supply chain For more information see A pandemic epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease such as COVID19 or coronavirus may materially and adversely impact our business our operations and our financial results These factors could make it more difficult for us to manufacture our products effectively and efficiently and could adversely impact our results of operations Some of our suppliers may be the only source for a particular component which makes us vulnerable to significant cost increases or shortage of supply We have many foreign suppliers for some of our parts in which we are subject to currency exchange rate volatility Some of our vendors are small in size and may have difficulty supplying the quantity and quality of materials required for our products as our business grows Vendors that are the sole source of certain products may decide to limit or eliminate sales of certain components due to product liability or other concerns and we might not be able to find a suitable replacement for those products Our inventory may run out before we find alternative suppliers and we might be forced to purchase excess inventory if available to last until we are able to qualify an alternate supplier If we cannot obtain a necessary component we may need to find test and obtain regulatory approval or clearance for a replacement component produce the component ourselves or redesign the related product which would cause significant delay and could increase our manufacturing costs Any of these events could adversely impact our results of operations We may not be successful in expanding our direct sales activities into international markets We are seeking to expand our international sales of our products by recruiting direct sales and support teams outside the US Our international operations in Germany Japan France Canada the United Kingdom Singapore and Australia are or will be subject to a number of risks which may vary from the risks we experience in the US including  the need to obtain regulatory approvals in foreign countries before our products may be sold or used  the need to procure reimbursement for our products in each foreign market  the generally lower level of reimbursement available in foreign markets relative to the US  the requirement to work with distributors or other partners to sell our products  longer sales cycles 25  uncertainty with respect to enforcement of legal rights by local regulatory or judicial authorities  limited protection of intellectual property rights  difficulty and delays in collecting accounts receivable  different income tax and sales tax environments  difficulty in supporting patients using our products  difficulty in attracting employees in foreign countries who want to work for a smaller US based company  different payroll employee benefits and statutory requirements  the adoption and expansion of trade restrictions including the occurrence or escalation of a trade war the imposition or modification of sanctions or other governmental action related to tariffs or trade agreements or policies among the governments of the United States China and other countries  regulatory changes and economic conditions leading up to and following Brexit the United Kingdoms recent exit from the European Union including uncertainties as to its timing and its effect on trade laws tariffs and taxes  fluctuations in the values of foreign currencies and  political and economic instability If we are unable to effectively expand our sales activities in international markets our results of operations could be negatively impacted The economic effects of Brexit may affect relationships with existing and future customers and could have an adverse impact on our business and operating results In June 2016 the United Kingdom held a referendum in which voters approved Brexit and following protracted negotiations the United Kingdom left the European Union on January 31 2020 Although the United Kingdom has passed legislation regarding the immediate impact of the United Kingdoms withdrawal from the European Union it is still unclear what terms if any may be agreed within the United Kingdom and between the United Kingdom and other countries on many aspects of fiscal policy crossborder trade and international relations both in the final outcome and for any transitional period Additionally under the withdrawal agreement with the European Union there is a transitional period until December 31 2020 extendable up to two years with an offer to request an extension to be made by June 2020 As this is an unprecedented event it is unclear what longterm economic financial trade and legal implications the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union would have and how such withdrawal would affect the regulation applicable to our business globally and specifically in the region If the United Kingdom were to significantly alter its regulations affecting the medical device industry we could face significant new costs It may also be timeconsuming and expensive for us to alter our internal operations in order to comply with new regulations Additionally as a result of Brexit the global markets and currencies have been adversely impacted A potential devaluation of the local currencies of our international buyers relative to the US dollar may impair the purchasing power of our international buyers and could cause international buyers to decrease their participation in our marketplaces or use of our products Further volatility in exchange rates resulting from Brexit is expected to continue in the short term as the United Kingdom finalizing its exit from the European Union We translate sales and other results of our activities in the United Kingdom denominated in British pounds into US dollars for our financial statements During periods of a strengthening dollar our reported international sales and earnings could be reduced because foreign currencies may translate into fewer US dollars We incurred revenues in the United Kingdom of 15 million 18 million and 11 million for the fiscal years ended March 31 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively Finally Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the United Kingdom determines which EU laws to replace or replicate and those laws and regulations may be cumbersome difficult or costly in terms of compliance Any of these effects of Brexit among others could adversely affect our business financial condition operating results and cash flows 26 We rely on distributors to sell our products in some international markets and poor performance by a distributor could reduce our sales and harm our business We rely on distributors to market and sell our products in certain parts of Europe Asia South America and the Middle East Many of these distributors have the exclusive right to distribute our products in their territory We may hire distributors to market our products in additional international markets in the future Our success in these markets will depend almost entirely upon the efforts of our distributors over whom we have little or no control If a distributor does not market and sell our products effectively and maintain a continued focus on the sale distribution and support of our products up to our standards we could lose sales and impair our ability to compete and introduce our technology in that market From time to time these distributors could decide to reduce their levels of inventory with regard to certain of our products due to various factors which could have an adverse effect on our business depending on the extend of the distributors sales Outbreaks of infectious diseases such as COVID19 or similar diseases may also create disruptions in our distribution networks especially in foreign markets that are forced to implement extended quarantine measures due to a lack of treatment andor testing resources For more information see A pandemic epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease such as COVID19 or coronavirus may materially and adversely impact our business our operations and our financial results We are subject to credit risk and foreign currency risk associated with shipments to our distributors and this could negatively impact our financial condition and liquidity in the future The profitability we have achieved in recent years may not be indicative of our ability to sustain profitability and it is possible that we may incur losses from operations in future periods We recognized net income of 2030 million 2590 million and 1122 million for the fiscal years ended March 31 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively The profitability we achieved in recent years may not be indicative of our ability to sustain future profitability and it is possible that we may incur losses from operations or net losses in future periods Any losses incurred in the future may result primarily from among other things  changes in demand for our products  the recent expansion of our global distribution network  investments in new markets such as Japan  ongoing product and clinical development  costs related to new business development initiatives such as potential acquisitions of new businesses  legal expenses related to patent and other matters such as the Maquet dispute and shareholder actions  costs associated with hiring additional personnel performing clinical trials continuing our research and development relating to our products under development seeking regulatory approvals and if we receive these approvals commencing commercial manufacturing and marketing activities  expanded marketing initiatives particularly with recent PMAs in the US  income and other related taxes  increase in stockbased compensation as we hire new employees and our stock prices has continued or could expect to continue to increase in the future  significant disruption to and volatility in national regional and local economies and markets and our internal operations caused by pandemics  significant expenditures necessary to market and manufacture in commercial quantities our approved circulatory care products  difficulty in forecasting these expenditures  the scope scale and duration of the impact of the COVID19 pandemic and  a prolonged downturn in global economic conditions including as a result of the COVID19 pandemic Our operating results may fluctuate unpredictably Historically our annual and quarterly operating results have fluctuated widely and we expect these fluctuations to continue Among the factors that may cause our operating results to fluctuate are  timing of customer orders and deliveries 27  seasonality of sales in the US European and Japanese markets where summer vacation schedules normally result in fewer medical procedures during the first half of our fiscal year  competitive changes such as price changes or new product introductions that we or our competitors may make  announcements by the FDA relating to our products and their impact on market perception of our product including shortterm impact  reputational risk relating to customer reviews of our products  the impact of additional investments to expand manufacturing capacity on cost of product sales  the timing of regulatory actions such as product approvals or recalls  costs we incur in developing and testing our Impella heart pumps and other products  the impact of adverse data or the perception of adverse data relating to our products and technology among the medical community  costs we incur in anticipation of future sales such as inventory purchases expansion of manufacturing facilities or establishment of international sales offices  additional taxes  the impact and timing of equity awards on stockbased compensation  timing of certain marketing programs and events  availability of physicians to use our products as there are seasonal impacts due to physician vacations or training events that limit their ability to be in the hospital to perform procedures that involve our products  the impact of any businesses or technologies we may acquire in the future  economic conditions in the healthcare industry  gains or losses on our portfolio investments such as Shockwave Medical  efforts by governments insurance companies and others to contain healthcare costs including changes to reimbursement policies  the impact of the adoption of certain accounting standards  clinical trial results that reveal disadvantages of our products for various markets we address or otherwise unfavorable or inconsistent data about our products and  the impact of a pandemic epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease such as the ongoing COVID19 outbreak on our and our customers ability to operate to full capacity We believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our historical results are not necessarily meaningful and investors should not rely on them as an indication of our future performance To the extent we experience the factors described above our future operating results may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors which may cause the market price of our common stock to decline We may undergo an ownership change for US federal income tax purposes which would limit our ability to utilize net operating losses from prior tax years If we undergo an ownership change for US federal income tax purposes our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards from prior years to reduce taxable income in future tax years might be limited by the Internal Revenue Code either by limiting the amount of net operating losses that can be utilized to offset taxable income in a given year or in total over the entire carryforward period Certain changes in the ownership of our common stock may result in an ownership change sufficient to limit the availability of our net operating losses Net operating losses foreign tax credits and research and development credits have expiry dates in the US and the ability to fully utilize them will be dependent upon generating taxable income in the future The potential benefits of net operating losses and other carryforwards may be limited as a result of examinations and audits by the IRS and other taxing authorities We also have net operating loss carryforwards in other countries outside of the US and our ability to use those losses in the future to offset taxable income could be limited by tax regulations in those countries 28 Compliance with and changes in tax laws including recently enacted US Tax Reform legislation could materially and adversely impact our financial condition results of operations and cash flows On December 22 2017 the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act or Tax Reform Act was signed into law that significantly revises the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as amended The newly enacted federal income tax law among other things contains significant changes to corporate taxation including reduction of the corporate tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35 to a rate of 21 effective January 1 2018 limitation of the deduction for net operating losses to 80 of current year taxable income in respect of net operating losses generated during or after fiscal 2018 and elimination of net operating loss carrybacks revisions to the treatment for US federal income tax purposes of foreign earnings immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time and modifying or repealing many business deductions and credits Additionally the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD the European Commission EC and individual taxing jurisdictions where we and our affiliates do business have recently focused on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations The OECD has released its comprehensive plan to create an agreed set of international rules for fighting base erosion and profit shifting In addition the OECD the EC and individual countries are examining changes to how taxing rights should be allocated among countries considering the digital economy As a result the tax laws in the US and other countries in which we and our affiliates do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis and any such changes could materially adversely affect our business The US Treasury Department the Internal Revenue Service and other standardsetting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the Tax Reform Act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretation Foreign governments may enact tax laws in response to the Tax Reform Act that could result in further changes to global taxation and materially affect our financial position and results of operations The calculation of tax exposures involves the application of complex tax laws and regulations in many jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the ultimate outcomes of these tax estimates or that issues raised by tax authorities will be resolved at a financial cost that does not exceed our related estimates of our tax provision The uncertainty surrounding the effect of the reforms on our financial results and business could also weaken confidence among investors in our financial condition This could in turn have a materially adverse effect on the price of our common stock We may not have sufficient funds to develop and commercialize our new products or make acquisitions of desirable companies products or technologies The development manufacture and sale of any medical device is very expensive and we may require additional funds to make acquisitions of desirable companies products or technologies We cannot be sure that we will have the necessary funds to develop and commercialize our new products or acquire companies products or technologies or that additional funds will be available on commercially acceptable terms if at all We currently have no debt and new sources of capital may not be available to us when we need it or may be available only on terms we would find unacceptable If we are unable to obtain the necessary funding to support these efforts our business may be adversely affected We believe we have sufficient liquidity to finance our operations for at least the next fiscal year based on available working capital and cash from operations We also may evaluate from time to time other financing alternatives as necessary to fund operations and any equity or convertible debt financing may involve dilution to our existing stockholders 29 We own patents trademarks trade secrets copyrights and other intellectual property and knowhow that we believe give us a competitive advantage If we cannot protect our intellectual property both domestically and internationally and develop or otherwise acquire additional intellectual property competition could force us to lower our prices which could hurt our profitability Our intellectual property rights are and will continue to be a critical component of our success We rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of intellectual property including patent trademark copyright trade secret and domain name protection laws as well as confidentiality agreements with our employees and others to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights If we fail to obtain and maintain adequate intellectual property protection we may not be able to prevent third parties from using our proprietary technologies or from marketing products that are very similar or identical to ours A substantial portion of our intellectual property rights relating to the Impella devices and other products under development is in the form of trade secrets and patents Unlike patents trade secrets are only recognized under applicable law if they are kept secret by restricting their disclosure to third parties We protect our trade secrets and proprietary knowledge in part through confidentiality agreements with employees consultants and other parties However certain consultants and third parties with whom we have business relationships and to whom in some cases we have disclosed trade secrets and other proprietary knowledge may also provide services to other parties in the medical device industry including companies universities and research organizations that are developing or marketing competing products In addition some of our former employees who were aware of certain of our trade secrets and other proprietary knowledge in the course of their employment may seek employment with and become employed by our competitors We cannot be assured that consultants employees and other third parties with whom we have entered into confidentiality agreements will not breach the terms of such agreements by improperly using or disclosing our trade secrets or other proprietary knowledge that we will have adequate remedies for any such breach or that our trade secrets will not become known to or be independently developed by our competitors The loss of trade secret protection for technologies or knowhow relating to our product portfolio and products under development could adversely affect our business and our prospects Our business position also depends in part on our ability to maintain and defend our existing patents and obtain maintain and defend additional patents and other intellectual property rights We intend to seek additional patents but our pending and future patent applications may not result in issued patents or be granted on a timely basis In addition issued patents may not contain claims sufficiently broad to protect us against third parties with similar technologies or products or provide us with any competitive advantage including exclusivity in a particular product area The scope of our patent claims also may vary between countries as individual countries have distinctive patent laws We may be subject to challenges by third parties regarding our intellectual property including among others claims regarding validity enforceability scope and effective term Patent prosecution related proceedings and litigation in the US and in other countries may be expensive time consuming and ultimately unsuccessful In addition patents issued by foreign countries may afford less protection than is available under US patent law and may not adequately protect our proprietary information Our competitors may independently develop proprietary technologies and processes that are the same as or substantially equivalent to ours or design around our patents Our competition may also hold or obtain intellectual property rights that would threaten our ability to develop or commercialize our product offerings The expiration of patents on which we rely for protection of key products could diminish our competitive advantage and adversely affect our business and our prospects Companies in the medical device industry typically obtain patents and frequently engage in intellectual property litigation Our products and technologies could infringe on the rights of others If a third party successfully asserts a claim for infringement against us we may be liable for substantial damages be unable to sell products using that technology or have to seek a license or redesign the related product These alternatives may be uneconomical or impossible Intellectual property litigation could be costly result in product development delays and divert the efforts and attention of management from our business For a discussion of our material legal proceedings including those related to patent matters as of March 31 2020 see Note 13 Commitment and Contingencies  Contingencies  to our consolidated financial statements in this report which is incorporated by reference into this item 30 Product liability claims could damage our reputation and adversely affect our financial results The clinical use of medical products even after regulatory approval poses an inherent risk of product liability claims We maintain limited product liability insurance coverage subject to certain deductibles and exclusions We cannot be sure that product liability insurance will be available in the future or will be available on acceptable terms or at reasonable costs or that such insurance will provide us with adequate coverage against potential liabilities We have been and anticipate that as part of our ordinary course of business we may be subject to product liability claims alleging defects in the design manufacture or labeling of our products Claims against us regardless of their merit or potential outcome may also hurt our ability to obtain physician endorsement of our products or expand our business As we continue to expand use or our existing products and introduce more products we face an increased risk that a material product liability claim will be brought against us Some of our products are designed for patients who suffer from latestage or endstage heart failure and many of these patients do not survive even when supported by our products There are many factors beyond our control that could result in patient death including the condition of the patient prior to use of the product the skill and reliability of physicians and hospital personnel using and monitoring the product and product maintenance by customers However the failure of our products used for clinical testing or sale could give rise to product liability claims and negative publicity The risk of product liability claims is heightened when we sell products that are intended to support a patient until the end of life The finite life of our products as well as complications associated with their use could give rise to product liability claims whether or not the products have extended or improved the quality of a patients life If we have to pay product liability claims in excess of our insurance coverage our financial condition will be adversely affected Quality issues may result in inventory writedowns and other costs Government regulations require us to track materials used in the manufacture of our products so that if an issue is identified in one product it can be traced to other products that may have the same issue An identified quality issues may require reworking or scrapping related inventory andor recalling previous shipments Because a malfunction in our products can possibly be lifethreatening we may be required to recall and replace free of charge products already in the marketplace Any quality issue could cause us to incur significant expenses lead to significant writeoffs of inventory injure our reputation and harm our business and financial results If we are found to have violated laws protecting the confidentiality of patient health information we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties which could increase our liabilities and harm our reputation or our business Our business requires us to use and store personally identifiable information of our customers vendors employees and business partners and in certain instances patients treated with our products in the clinical setting We are subject to various domestic and international privacy and security regulations including but not limited to HIPAA and the GDPR HIPAA mandates among other things the adoption of uniform standards for the electronic exchange of information in common healthcare transactions as well as standards relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information which require the adoption of administrative physical and technical safeguards to protect such information In addition many states have enacted comparable laws addressing the privacy and security of health information some of which are more stringent than HIPAA For instance the California Consumer Privacy Act or the CCPA which grants expanded rights to access and delete personal information and opt out of certain personal information sharing among other things became effective on January 1 2020 The GDPR is a comprehensive update to the data protection regime in the European Economic Area that was effective beginning in fiscal 2019 The GDPR imposes new requirements relating to among other things consent to process personal data of individuals the information provided to individuals regarding the processing of their personal data the security and confidentiality of personal data and notifications in the event of data breaches and use of third party processors Penalties for violations of the GDPR can be as high as the greater of 20 million or 4 of worldwide gross revenue We are also subject to laws and regulations with respect to crossborder transfers of such data out of certain jurisdictions in which we operate including the EU If we are unable to transfer data between and among countries and regions in which we operate it could affect the manner in which we provide our services or adversely affect our financial results 31 Due to the geographic scope of our operations HIPAA the CCPA the GDPR and other privacy and securityrelated laws and regulations which are currently in effect or may come into effect may increase our responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process We may in turn be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with privacy laws and regulations If we or any of our service providers are found to be in violation of the promulgated patient privacy rules under various regimes we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties which could increase our liabilities harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results Disruptions of critical information systems or material breaches in the security of our systems could harm our business customer relations and financial condition We rely in part on information technology or IT to store information communicate with our business partners interface with customers maintain financial accuracy secure our data and accurately produce our financial statements If our information technology systems do not effectively and securely collect store process and report relevant data for the operation of our business whether due to equipment malfunction or constraints software deficiencies or human error our ability to effectively plan forecast and execute our business plan and comply with applicable laws and regulations would be materially impaired Any such impairment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and the timeliness with which we report our operating results In the current environment there are numerous and evolving risks to cybersecurity and privacy including criminal hackers hacktivists statesponsored intrusions industrial espionage employee malfeasance and human or technological error Highprofile security breaches at other companies and in government agencies have increased in recent years and security industry experts and government officials have warned about the risks of hackers and cyberattacks targeting businesses such as ours Cyberattacks are becoming more sophisticated and frequent and in some cases have caused significant harm Computer hackers and others routinely attempt to breach the security of technology products services and systems and to fraudulently induce employees customers or others to disclosure information or unwittingly provide access to systems or data We have experienced and expect to continue to experience actual or attempted cyberattacks of our IT systems or networks To date none of these actual or attempted cyberattacks has had a material effect on our operations or financial condition While we devote significant resources to network security data encryption and other security measures to protect our systems and data including our own proprietary information and the confidential and personally identifiable information of our customers employees business partners and patients these measures cannot provide absolute security The costs to eliminate or alleviate network security problems bugs viruses worms malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful resulting potentially in the theft loss destruction or corruption of information we store electronically as well as unexpected interruptions delays or cessation of service any of which could cause harm to our business operations Moreover if a computer security breach or cyberattack affects our systems or results in the unauthorized release of proprietary or personally identifiable information our reputation could be materially damaged our customer confidence could be diminished and our operations including technical support for our devices could be impaired We would also be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and potential liability which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition Any of these may contribute to the loss of customers and have a material adverse effect on our business If we acquire other companies or businesses we will be subject to risks that could hurt our business We may pursue acquisitions to obtain complementary businesses products or technologies Any such acquisition may not produce the revenues earnings or business synergies that we anticipate An acquired business product or technology might not perform as we expect Our management could spend a significant amount of time effort and money in identifying pursuing and completing the acquisition If we complete an acquisition we may encounter significant difficulties and incur sizable expenses in integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired company into our operations For more information on the acquisition agreement that we signed in April 2020 for the acquisition of Breethe Inc or Breethe see Part II Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsAcquisition of Breethe Inc We may lose the services of key employees of the acquired company and we may make changes in management that impair the acquired companys relationships with its legacy employees vendors and customers Furthermore we may acquire developmentstage companies that are not yet profitable that require continued investment or become subject to events that could impair the value of our investment which could decrease our future earnings We may also assume significant liabilities in such a transaction Any of these outcomes could prevent us from realizing the anticipated benefits of an acquisition To pay for an acquisition we might use stock or cash Alternatively we might borrow money from a bank or other lender If we use stock our stockholders would experience dilution of their ownership interests If we use cash or debt financing our financial liquidity would be reduced 32 If we include future milestones as part of the potential purchase price of an acquisition then we will have to estimate the value of these milestones each reporting period and any changes underlying these estimates with respect to expected timing or valuation of these milestones could have a volatile impact on our earnings See Part II Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation Acquisition of Breethe Inc  regarding the milestone payments under our signed with Breethe We periodically make investments in medical device companies that focus on heart failure and heart pump s and other medical device technologies The aggregate carrying amount of our portfolio of investments in medical device companies was 387 million and 246 million at March 31 2020 and 2019  respectively and is classified within other assets in the consolidated balance sheets Revisions to accounting standards tax laws and financial reporting requirements could result in changes to our standard practices and could require a significant expenditure of time attention and resources especially by senior management We must follow accounting standards tax laws and financial reporting requirements set by the governing bodies and lawmakers in the US and in other jurisdictions where we do business From time to time these governing bodies and lawmakers implement new and revised rules and laws which may require changes to our accounting policies financial reporting and the related information we file with governing bodies Implementing mandatory changes may require a significant expenditure of time attention and resources It is impossible to completely predict the impact if any of future changes to accounting standards and financial reporting requirements We use estimates make judgments and apply certain methods in measuring the progress of our business in determining our financial results and in applying our accounting policies As these estimates judgments and methods change our assessment of the progress of our business and our results of operations could vary The methods estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations Such methods estimates and judgments are by their nature subject to risks complexities uncertainties and assumptions and factors may arise over time that may lead us to change our methods estimates and judgments Changes in any of our assumptions may cause variation in our financial reporting and may adversely affect our reported financial results Environmental and health safety laws including recent environmental regulatory action regarding medical device sterilization facilities may result in liabilities expenses and restrictions on our operations Federal state local and foreign laws regarding environmental protection hazardous substances and human health and safety may adversely affect our business Using hazardous substances in our operations exposes us to the risk of accidental injury contamination or other liability from the use storage importation handling or disposal of hazardous materials If our or our suppliers operations result in pollution of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances we could be liable for damages expenses and fines and any liability could significantly exceed our insurance coverage and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition Additionally increased costs on our suppliers stemming from compliance with new or existing environmental or health safety laws and regulations may adversely affect us as such laws and regulations could result in operational impacts including facility shutdowns Suppliers may also choose to pass compliance costs to us in the form of adjusted pricing Recent environmental regulatory action regarding medical device sterilization may adversely impact us in the ways described above although the outcome of this action currently remains uncertain Many of our products require sterilization prior to sale and we contract with thirdparty sterilizers to perform this service including ethylene oxide sterilizers In November 2019 the US Environmental Protection Agency or the EPA proposed amendments to national emissions standards to reduce hazardous air pollutants including emissions of ethylene oxide by adding requirements for process vents storage tanks and equipment in ethylene oxide service Additional regulation to address ethylene oxide emissions at sterilization facilities is expected including revisions to the EPAs national emissions standards for such facilities In addition throughout the end of 2019 and the beginning of 2020 state agencies shut down andor temporarily suspended operations at ethylene oxide sterilization facilities in Illinois Michigan and Georgia During the ongoing COVID19 pandemic the EPA stated that it will continue to coordinate with state and local air agencies that have been working to reduce ethylene oxide emissions in their jurisdictions However certain of the previouslyshut down facilities have been permitted to resume certain operations due to increased emissions controls andor the need to sterilize protective equipment during the pandemic In addition although the EPAs Office of Inspector General released a report in March 2020 recommending that the EPA provide residents in all communities near 25 highpriority ethylene oxideemitting facilities with a forum with the EPA or state personnel regarding exposure to ethylene oxide the EPA Administrator immediately critiqued the report and requested that it be rescinded for appropriate revision The FDA has also voiced concerns that shutdowns may diminish the supply of available sterilization facilities and cause medical device shortages 33 It is currently uncertain to what extent facilities that resumed operations in response to the COVID19 pandemic will be shut down again for environmental concerns  or whether any shutdown facilities will reopen or other facilities will be required to shut down  While the sterilization facilities previously or currently shut down or suspended do not sterilize our products and are not otherwise in our supply chain and our suppliers are not affected directly by these recent regulatory actions increased scrutiny and regulation of ethylene oxide sterilization facilities in the US could create additional costs for our suppliers who may be required to take steps with respect to their sterilization processes These costs could in turn be passed on to us and adversely affect our business Also to the extent we or our contract sterilizers are unable to sterilize our products whether due to these regulatory or other constraints such as capacity or availability of materials for sterilization we may be unable to transition to other contract sterilizers sterilizer locations or sterilization methods in a timely or cost effective manner or at all This failure to transition our processes due to decreased thirdparty sterilization capacity could have a materially adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could result in declines in our reported sales and results of operations Because some of our international sales are denominated in local currencies and not in US dollars our reported sales and earnings are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily the Euro At present we do not hedge our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations As a result revenues and expenses occurring in the future that are denominated in foreign currencies may be translated into US dollars at less favorable rates resulting in reduced revenues and earnings Consolidation in the healthcare industry could lead to demands for price concessions which could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition Because healthcare costs have risen significantly over the past decade numerous initiatives and reforms initiated by legislators regulators and thirdparty payers to curb these costs have resulted in a consolidation trend in the healthcare industry to aggregate purchasing power As the healthcare industry consolidates competition to provide products and services to industry participants has become and will continue to become more intense This in turn has resulted and will likely continue to result in greater pricing pressures and the exclusion of certain suppliers from important market segments as group purchasing organizations independent delivery networks and large single accounts continue to use their market power to consolidate purchasing decisions for hospitals We expect that market demand government regulation thirdparty coverage and reimbursement policies and societal pressures will continue to change the worldwide healthcare industry resulting in further business consolidations and alliances among our customers which may reduce competition exert further downward pressure on the prices of our products and may adversely impact our business results of operations or financial condition Risks Related to Our Common Stock The market price of our common stock is volatile which has in the past led to and may in the future lead to securities litigation against us Such litigation may be costly and result in an adverse outcome The market price of our common stock has fluctuated widely and may continue to do so Many factors could cause the market price of our common stock to rise and fall Some of these factors are  variations in our quarterly results of operations  status of regulatory approvals for our products  announcements by the FDA relating to our products and their impact on market perception of our product including shortterm impact  reputational risk relating to customer reviews of our products  introduction of new products by us or our competitors  acquisitions or strategic alliances involving us or our competitors  changes in healthcare policy or thirdparty reimbursement practices  changes in estimates of our performance or recommendations by securities analysts  the hiring or departure of key personnel  results of clinical trials of our products  notice of a recall or other safety issue that impacts the ability for customers to use our products  future sales of shares of common stock in the public market 34  the outcome of currently pending litigation and governmental investigations or the initiation of additional litigation or government investigations against us   and market conditions in the industry particularly around reimbursement for our products and the economy as a whole In addition the stock market in general and the market for shares of medical device companies in particular have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years These fluctuations are often unrelated to the operating performance of individual companies These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock When the market price of a companys stock drops significantly stockholders often institute securities class action litigation against that company see Note 13 Commitment and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements in this report which is incorporated by reference into this item We are generally obliged under our bylaws to the extent permitted under Delaware law to indemnify our current and former officers who are named as defendants in these types of lawsuits While a certain amount of insurance coverage is available for expenses or losses associated with these lawsuits this coverage may not be sufficient Based on information currently available we are unable to estimate reasonably a possible loss or range of possible losses if any with regard to the securities class action and shareholder derivative litigation therefore no litigation reserve has been recorded in our consolidated balance sheet Although we plan to defend against the securities class action and shareholder derivative litigation vigorously there can be no assurances that a favorable final outcome will be obtained This litigation and other future litigation against us could cause us to incur substantial costs divert the time and attention of our management and other resources or otherwise harm our business The sale of additional shares of our common stock the issuance of restricted stock units or the exercise of outstanding options to purchase our common stock would dilute our stockholders ownership interest We have historically issued restricted stock units and stock options to acquire our common stock and we expect to continue to issue restricted stock units and stock options to our employees and others in the future If all outstanding stock options were exercised and all outstanding restricted stock units vested our stockholders would suffer dilution of their ownership interest In addition we have issued from time to time additional shares of our common stock in connection with acquisitions public offerings and other activities Future issuances of our common stock would also result in a dilution of our stockholders ownership interest Our certificate of incorporation and Delaware law could make it more difficult for a thirdparty to acquire us and may prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium on our stock Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and Delaware General Corporation Law may make it more difficult for a thirdparty to acquire us even if doing so would allow our stockholders to receive a premium over the prevailing market price of our stock Those provisions of our certificate of incorporation and Delaware law are intended to encourage potential acquirers to negotiate with us and allow our board of directors the opportunity to consider alternative proposals in the interest of maximizing stockholder value However such provisions may also discourage acquisition proposals or delay or prevent a change in control which could negatively affect our stock price The market value of our common stock could vary significantly based on market perceptions of the status of our product development efforts The perception of securities analysts regarding our product development efforts could significantly affect our stock price As a result the market price of our common stock has and could in the future change substantially when we or our competitors make product announcements Many factors affecting our stock price are industry related and beyond our control We have not paid and do not expect to pay dividends and any return on our stockholders investment will likely be limited to gains realized based on the value of our common stock We have never paid dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future The payment of dividends on our common stock will depend on our earnings financial condition and other business and economic factors affecting us at such time as our board of directors may consider relevant If we do not pay dividends our common stock may be less valuable because a return on our stockholders investment will only occur if our stock price appreciates ITEM 1B
