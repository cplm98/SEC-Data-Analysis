world at the millions of merchants that accept cards bearing our logo Our business as a whole has not experienced significant seasonal fluctuations although card billed business tends to be moderately higher in the fourth quarter than in other quarters As a result the amount of Card Member loans and receivables outstanding tend to be moderately higher during that quarter The average discount rate also tends to be slightly lower during the fourth quarter due to a higher level of retailrelated billed business volumes 1 Table of Contents The American Express Brand Our brand and its attributes  trust security and service  are key assets We continue to focus on our brand and our products and services are evidence of our commitment to its attributes Our brand has consistently been rated one of the most valuable brands in the world and we believe it provides us with a significant competitive advantage We believe our brand is critical to our success and we invest heavily in managing marketing promoting and protecting it We also place significant importance on trademarks service marks and patents and seek to secure our intellectual property rights around the world Our ClosedLoop Network and SpendCentric Model Wherever we manage both the cardissuing activities of the business and the acquiring relationship with merchants there is a closed loop which distinguishes our network from the bankcard networks in that we have access to information at both ends of the card transaction We maintain direct relationships with both our Card Members as a card issuer and merchants as an acquirer and we handle all key aspects of those relationships Through contractual relationships we also obtain data from thirdparty card issuers merchant acquirers and processors with whom we do business Our closed loop allows us to analyze information on Card Member spending and build algorithms and other analytical tools that we use to underwrite risk reduce fraud and provide targeted marketing and other information services for merchants and special offers and services to Card Members through a variety of channels all while respecting Card Member preferences and protecting Card Member and merchant data in compliance with applicable policies and legal requirements Our spendcentric business model focuses on generating revenues primarily by driving spending on our cards and secondarily by finance charges and fees Spending on our cards which is higher on average on a percard basis versus our competitors offers superior value to merchants in the form of loyal customers and larger transactions Because of the revenues generated from having highspending Card Members we have the flexibility to invest in attractive rewards and other benefits for Card Members as well as targeted marketing and other programs and investments for merchants This creates incentives for Card Members to spend more on their cards and positively differentiates American Express cards We believe our closedloop network and spendcentric business model continue to be competitive advantages by giving us the ability to provide differentiated value to Card Members merchants and our cardissuing partners  BUSINESS OPERATIONS Consumer Services We offer a wide range of charge cards and revolving credit cards to consumers in the United States and internationally through our US Consumer Services USCS and International Consumer  Network Services ICNS segments In addition to our proprietary cards we partner with banks and other organizations to issue American Expressbranded products Moreover we offer several services that complement our core business including consumer travel services and deposit and noncard financing products Our global proprietary card business offers a broad set of card products rewards and services to acquire and retain highspending creditworthy Card Members Core elements of our strategy are  Designing card products with features that appeal to our target customer base  Using incentives to drive spending on our various card products and generate loyal Card Members including our Membership Rewards  program cashback reward features and participation in loyalty programs sponsored by our cobrand and other partners  Providing exceptional customer service digital resources and an array of benefits across card products to address travel and other needs  Developing a wide range of partner relationships including with other corporations and institutions that sponsor certain of our cards under cobrand arrangements Our charge cards are designed primarily as a method of payment with Card Members generally paying the full amount billed each month Charges are approved based on a variety of factors including a Card Members current spending patterns payment history credit record and financial resources Revolving credit card products and features provide Card Members with the flexibility to pay their bill in full each month or carry a monthly balance on their cards to finance the purchase of goods or services  The use of the term partner or partnering does not mean or imply a formal legal partnership and is not meant in any way to alter the terms of American Express relationship with thirdparty issuers and merchant acquirers 2 Table of Contents Our Global Network Services GNS business which is under our ICNS segment establishes and maintains relationships with banks and other institutions around the world that issue cards and in certain countries acquire local merchants onto the American Express network In assessing whether we should pursue a proprietary or GNS strategy in a given country or some combination thereof we consider a wide range of countryspecific factors including the stability and attractiveness of financial returns the size of the potential Card Member base the strength of available marketing and credit data the size of cobrand opportunities and how we can best create strong merchant value Our GNS arrangements are categorized as follows  Independent Operator Arrangements in which partners can be licensed to issue local currency cards in their countries and serve as the merchant acquirer and processor for local merchants  Network Card License Arrangements in which partners can be licensed to issue American Expressbranded cards primarily in countries where we have a proprietary cardissuing andor merchant acquiring business  Joint Venture Arrangements in which we join with a third party to establish a separate business to sign new merchants and issue American Expressbranded cards The GNS business has established 150 cardissuing andor merchantacquiring arrangements with banks and other institutions in more than 130 countries and territories GNS strengthens our brand visibility around the world drives more transaction volume on the American Express network and increases the number of merchants choosing to accept the American Express card generally without assuming additional Card Member credit risk or having to invest a large amount of resources as our GNS partners already have established attractive customer bases and are responsible for most of the operating costs as well as for managing the credit risk associated with the cards they issue Global Commercial Services In our Global Commercial Services GCS segment we offer a wide range of payment and expense management solutions to companies and organizations of all sizes including card and other payment solutions cross border payment services and commercial financing solutions We have a suite of businesstobusiness

businesses in our communities and continued to lead Small Business Saturday  in 2016 Global Merchant Services Our Global Merchant Services GMS business builds and maintains relationships with merchants merchant acquirers and processors processes card transactions and settles with merchants that choose to accept our cards for purchases We sign merchants to accept our cards and provide marketing information and other programs and services to merchants leveraging the capabilities provided by our closedloop network We also offer support for card acceptance fraud prevention and other valueadded services Through our direct and inbound channels we contract with merchants agree on the discount rate a fee charged to the merchant for accepting our cards and handle servicing We also work with third parties to acquire small and mediumsized merchants For example through our OptBlue  merchantacquiring program thirdparty processors contract directly with small merchants for card acceptance and determine merchant pricing The OptBlue program provides an alternative for eligible small merchants who may prefer to deal with one acquirer for all their card acceptance needs OptBlue processors provide relevant merchant data back to us so we can maintain our closed loop of transaction data Globally as acceptance of generalpurpose cards continues to increase we continue to grow merchant acceptance of American Express cards around the world as well as refine our approach to calculating merchant coverage We estimate that as of the end of 2016 our merchant network in the United States could accommodate more than 90 percent of generalpurpose card spending Our international spend coverage is more limited although we continue to expand our merchant network in locations outside the United States We estimate that our international merchant network as a whole could accommodate approximately 80 percent of generalpurpose card spending These percentages are based on comparing spending on all networks generalpurpose credit and charge cards at merchants that accept American Express cards with total generalpurpose credit and charge card spending at all merchants 3 Table of Contents GMS also builds loyalty coalition programs such as the Payback  program in Germany India Italy Mexico and Poland and the Plenti  program in the United States Our loyalty coalition programs enable consumers to earn rewards points and use them to save on purchases from a variety of participating merchants through multicategory rewards platforms Merchants generally fund the consumer offers and are responsible to us for the cost of loyalty points we earn revenue from operating the loyalty platform and by providing marketing support Corporate  Other Corporate  Other consists of corporate functions and certain other businesses including our prepaid services business that offers stored valueprepaid products such as American Express Serve   Bluebird   the American Express  Gift Card and Travelers Cheques Our support functions including servicing credit insurance and technology are organized by process rather than business unit which we believe serves to streamline costs reduce duplication of work better integrate skills and expertise and improve customer service COMPETITION We compete in the global payments industry with charge credit and debit card networks issuers and acquirers paperbased transactions eg cash and checks bank transfer models eg wire transfers and Automated Clearing House or ACH as well as evolving and growing alternative payment and financing providers As the payments industry continues to evolve we face increasing competition from nontraditional players that leverage new technologies and customer relationships to create payment or financing solutions As a card issuer we compete with financial institutions that issue generalpurpose charge and revolving credit cards and debit cards We also encounter competition from businesses that issue their own private label cards or extend credit to their customers such as retailers and online lenders We face increasing competition for cobrand relationships as both card issuer and network competitors have targeted key business partners with attractive value propositions Our global card network competes in the global payments industry with other card networks including among others Visa MasterCard Discover primarily in the United States Diners Club International which is owned by Discover Financial Services and JCB and China UnionPay primarily in Asia We are the fourth largest generalpurpose card network on a global basis based on purchase volume behind China UnionPay Visa and MasterCard In addition to such networks a range of companies globally including merchant acquirers and processors as well as regional payment networks such as the National Payments Corporation of India carry out some activities similar to those performed by our GMS and GNS businesses The principal competitive factors that affect the cardissuing network and merchant service businesses include  The features value and quality of the products and services including customer care rewards programs partnerships benefits and digital resources and the costs associated with providing such features and services  The number spending characteristics and credit performance of customers  The quantity diversity and quality of the establishments where the cards can be used  The attractiveness of the value proposition to card issuers cardholders and merchants including the relative cost of using or accepting the products and services and capabilities such as fraud prevention and data analytics  The number and quality of other payment cards and other forms of payment available to customers  The success of marketing and promotional campaigns  Reputation and brand recognition  Innovation and investment in systems technologies and product and service offerings  The nature and quality of expense management tools electronic payment methods and data capture and reporting capabilities particularly for business customers  The security of cardholder and merchant information Another aspect of competition is the dynamic and rapid growth of alternative payment mechanisms systems and products which include aggregators eg PayPal Square and Amazon marketplace lenders wireless payment technologies including using mobile telephone networks to carry out transactions web and mobilebased payment platforms eg PayPal and Venmo electronic wallet providers including handset manufacturers telecommunication providers retailers retail coalitions banks and technology companies prepaid systems virtual currencies gift cards blockchain and similar distributed ledger technologies and systems linked to payment cards or that provide payment solutions Partnerships have been formed by various competitors to integrate more financial services into their product offerings and competitors are attempting to replicate our closedloop functionality such as the merchantprocessing platform ChaseNet New payments competitors continue to emerge in response to evolving technologies consumer habits and merchant needs 4 Table of Contents In addition to the discussion in this section see  Our operating results may suffer because of substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the payments industry  in Risk Factors for further discussion of the potential impact of competition on our business and  Ongoing legal proceedings regarding provisions in our merchant contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business result in additional litigation andor arbitrations subject us to substantial monetary damages and damage to our reputation and brand  in Risk Factors for a discussion of the potential impact on our ability to compete effectively if ongoing legal proceedings limit our ability to prevent merchants from engaging in various actions to discriminate against our card products SUPERVISION AND REGULATION Overview As a participant in the financial services industry we are subject to substantial regulation in the United States and in other jurisdictions and the costs of compliance are substantial In recent years the financial services industry has been subject to rigorous scrutiny high regulatory expectations and a stringent and unpredictable regulatory enforcement environment In addition legislators and regulators in various countries in which we operate have focused on the operation of card networks including through antitrust actions legislation and regulations to change certain practices or pricing of card issuers merchant acquirers and payment networks and in some cases to establish broad and ongoing regulatory oversight regimes for payment systems See Risk FactorsLegal Regulatory and Compliance Risks for a discussion of the potential impact legislative and regulatory changes may have on our results of operations and financial condition Banking Regulation Federal and state banking laws regulations and policies extensively regulate the Company TRS and our two US bank subsidiaries American Express Centurion Bank Centurion Bank and American Express Bank FSB American Express Bank Both the Company and TRS are subject to comprehensive consolidated supervision regulation and examination by the Federal Reserve under the BHC Act Centurion Bank a Utahchartered industrial bank is regulated supervised and examined by the Utah Department of Financial Institutions and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC American Express Bank a federal savings bank is regulated supervised and examined by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency OCC The Company and its subsidiaries are also subject to the rulemaking enforcement and examination authority of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau CFPB Banking regulators have broad examination and enforcement power including the power to impose substantial fines limit dividends and other capital distributions restrict operations and acquisitions and require divestitures Many aspects of our business also are subject to rigorous regulation by other US federal and state regulatory agencies and by nonUS government agencies and regulatory bodies Activities The BHC Act generally limits bank holding companies to activities that are considered to be banking activities and certain closely related activities Each of the Company and TRS is a bank holding company and each has elected to become a financial holding company which is authorized to engage in a broader range of financial and related activities In order to remain eligible for financial holding company status we must meet certain eligibility requirements Those requirements include that the Company and each of its subsidiary US depository institutions must be well capitalized and well managed and each of its subsidiary US depository institutions must have received at least a satisfactory rating on its most recent assessment under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 the CRA The Company and TRS engage in various activities permissible only for financial holding companies including in particular providing travel agency services acting as a finder and engaging in certain insurance underwriting and agency services If the Company fails to meet eligibility requirements for financial holding company status it is likely to be barred from engaging in new types of financial activities or making certain types of acquisitions or investments in reliance on its status as a financial holding company and ultimately could be required to either discontinue the broader range of activities permitted to financial holding companies or divest its subsidiary US depository institutions In addition the Company and its subsidiaries are prohibited by law from engaging in practices that the relevant regulatory authority deems unsafe or unsound which such authorities generally interpret broadly Acquisitions and Investments Applicable federal and state laws place limitations on the ability of persons to invest in or acquire control of us without providing notice to or obtaining the approval of one or more of our regulators In addition we are subject to banking laws and regulations that limit our investments and acquisitions and in some cases subject them to the prior review and approval of our regulators including the Federal Reserve the OCC and the FDIC The banking agencies have broad discretion in evaluating proposed acquisitions and investments that are subject to their prior review or approval 5 Table of Contents Stress Testing and Capital Planning The DoddFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act imposes heightened prudential requirements on bank holding companies with at least 50 billion in total consolidated assets such as the Company and requires the Federal Reserve to establish prudential standards that are more stringent than those applicable to smaller bank holding companies Under the Federal Reserves regulations the Company is subject to annual supervisory and semiannual companyrun stress testing requirements that are designed to evaluate whether a bank holding company has sufficient capital on a total consolidated basis to absorb losses and support operations under adverse economic conditions The FDIC and the OCC have also issued rules to implement annual stress testing requirements that are applicable to Centurion Bank and American Express Bank We publish the stress test results for the Company Centurion Bank and American Express Bank on our Investor Relations website The results of the Companys annual stress test are incorporated into our annual capital plan which must cover a planning horizon of at least nine quarters and which we are required to submit to the Federal Reserve for review under its Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review CCAR process As part of CCAR the Federal Reserve evaluates whether the Company has sufficient capital to continue operations under various scenarios of economic and financial market stress developed by both the Company and the Federal Reserve including after taking into account planned capital distributions such as dividend payments and common stock repurchases Sufficient capital for these purposes is likely to require us to maintain capital ratios appreciably above applicable minimum requirements The scenarios are designed to stress our risks and vulnerabilities and assess our proforma capital position and ratios under hypothetical stress environments The Federal Reserve has broad authority to object to capital plans and to require bank holding companies to revise and resubmit their capital plans We are also subject to an ongoing requirement to revise and resubmit our capital plans upon the occurrence of certain events specified by rule In addition to other limitations our ability to make any capital distributions including dividends and share repurchases is contingent on the Federal Reserves nonobjection to our capital plan We are required to submit our capital plans and stress testing results to the Federal Reserve on or before April 5 of each year The Federal Reserve is expected to publish the decisions for all the bank holding companies participating in CCAR 2017 including the reasons for any objection to capital plans by June 30 2017 In addition the Federal Reserve will publish separately the results of its supervisory stress test under both the supervisory severely adverse and adverse scenarios The information to be released will include among other things the Federal Reserves projection of companyspecific information including poststress capital ratio information over the planning horizon Dividends and Other Capital Distributions The Company and TRS as well as Centurion Bank American Express Bank and the Companys insurance subsidiaries are limited in their ability to pay dividends by banking statutes regulations and supervisory policy Dividend payments by the Company to shareholders are subject to the oversight of the Federal Reserve As discussed in Stress Testing and Capital Planning the Company may only make capital distributions that have been included in a capital plan to which the Federal Reserve has issued a nonobjection Even if the Federal Reserve has not objected to a distribution the Company may still not make a distribution without Federal Reserve approval if among other things the Company will not meet a minimum regulatory capital ratio after giving effect to the capital distribution or if changes in facts would result in a requirement to resubmit our capital plan or the Companys earnings are materially underperforming its projections in the capital plan In general federal and applicable state banking laws prohibit without first obtaining regulatory approval insured depository institutions such as Centurion Bank and American Express Bank from making dividend distributions to in our case TRS if such distributions are not paid out of available recent earnings or would cause the institution to fail to meet capital adequacy standards In addition to specific limitations on the dividends the Companys bank subsidiaries can pay to TRS federal banking regulators have authority to prohibit or limit the payment of a dividend if in the banking regulators opinion payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the institution Capital Leverage and Liquidity Regulation Capital Rules The Company Centurion Bank and American Express Bank are required to comply with the applicable capital adequacy rules established by federal banking regulators These rules are intended to ensure that bank holding companies and depository institutions collectively banking organizations have adequate capital given the level of assets and offbalance sheet obligations The federal banking regulators current capital rules which subject to phasein provisions generally became applicable to the Company Centurion Bank and American Express Bank in 2014 the Capital Rules largely implement the Basel Committee on Banking Supervisions the Basel Committee framework for strengthening international capital regulation known as Basel III The minimum capital and buffer requirements under the Capital Rules will be fully phased in by January 1 2019 For additional information regarding our capital ratios see Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity under MDA 6 Table of Contents Under the Capital Rules banking organizations are required to maintain minimum ratios for Common Equity Tier 1 CET1 Tier 1 and Total capital to riskweighted assets In addition all banking organizations remain subject to a minimum leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital to average total consolidated assets as defined for regulatory purposes The Company as an advanced approaches institution will also become subject to a supplementary leverage ratio on January 1 2018 In addition the Company Centurion Bank and American Express Bank are required to calculate riskbased capital ratios under both the generally applicable standardized approach and the advanced approaches capital rule and then use the lower of each capital ratio to determine whether each meets its minimum riskbased capital requirements Since 2014 we have reported our capital adequacy ratios on a parallel basis to federal banking regulators using both riskweighted assets calculated under the Basel III standardized approach as adjusted for certain items and the requirements for an advanced approaches institution During this parallel period federal banking regulators assess our compliance with the advanced approaches requirements The parallel period will continue until we receive regulatory notification to exit parallel reporting at which point we will begin publicly reporting regulatory riskbased capital ratios calculated under both the advanced approaches and the standardized approach under the Capital Rules and will be required to use the lower of these ratios in order to determine whether we are in compliance with minimum capital requirements Depending on how the advanced approaches are ultimately implemented for our asset types our capital ratios calculated under the advanced approaches may be lower than under the standardized approach The Federal Reserve has indefinitely delayed use of the advanced approaches in CCAR and therefore the standardized approach will remain the applicable measurement for such purposes The Company Centurion Bank and American Express Bank must each maintain CET1 Tier 1 capital that is CET1 plus additional Tier 1 capital and Total capital that is Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital ratios of at least 45 percent 60 percent and 80 percent respectively The Capital Rules also implement a 25 percent capital conservation buffer composed entirely of CET1 on top of these minimum riskweighted asset ratios As a result the minimum ratios are effectively 70 percent 85 percent and 105 percent for the CET1 Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios respectively on a fully phasedin basis Implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on January 1 2016 at the 0625 percent level and will increase in equal increments at the beginning of each year ie 125 percent as of January 1 2017 until it is fully implemented on January 1 2019 The required minimum capital ratios for the Company may be further increased by a countercyclical capital buffer composed entirely of CET1 up to 25 percent which may be assessed when federal banking regulators determine that such a buffer is necessary to protect the banking system from disorderly downturns associated with excessively expansionary periods As of October 2016 the Federal Reserve set the countercyclical capital buffer to zero percent Assuming full phase in of the capital conservation buffer and the maximum countercyclical capital buffer were in place the Companys effective minimum CET1 Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios could be 95 percent 110 percent and 130 percent respectively Banking institutions whose ratio of CET1 Tier 1 Capital or Total capital to riskweighted assets is above the minimum but below the capital conservation buffer or below the combined capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer when the latter is applied will face constraints on discretionary distributions such as dividends repurchases and redemptions of capital securities and executive compensation based on the amount of the shortfall In December 2015 and March 2016 the Basel Committee proposed a series of revisions to the standardized approach to calculating regulatory capital requirements including new rules that would create additional capital requirements for certain unconditionally cancellable commitments such as unused credit card lines of credit If adopted in the United States as proposed by the Basel Committee this change would increase the capital requirements for card issuers like us In addition the Basel Committee has proposed adjustments to the standardized calculation of operational risk capital requirements If adopted in the United States as proposed by the Basel Committee the changes could create additional capital requirements for banking organizations like us that are highly specialized in feebased businesses and conduct significant feebased activities Leverage Requirements We are also required to comply with minimum leverage ratio requirements The leverage ratio is the ratio of a banking organizations Tier 1 capital to its average total consolidated assets as defined for regulatory purposes All banking organizations are required to maintain a leverage ratio of at least 40 percent The Capital Rules also establish a supplementary leverage ratio requirement for advanced approaches banking organizations such as the Company The supplementary leverage ratio is the ratio of Tier 1 capital to an expanded concept of leverage exposure that includes both onbalance sheet and certain offbalance sheet exposures The Capital Rules require a minimum supplementary leverage ratio of 30 percent beginning January 1 2018 The supplemental leverage ratio will be factored into our 2017 CCAR submission and evaluation of our capital plan by the Federal Reserve Liquidity Regulation The Federal Reserves enhanced prudential standards rule includes heightened liquidity and overall risk management requirements The rule requires the maintenance of a liquidity buffer consisting of highly liquid assets that is sufficient to meet projected net outflows for 30 days over a range of liquidity stress scenarios 7 Table of Contents In addition the Company Centurion Bank and American Express Bank are subject to a liquidity coverage ratio LCR requirement which is designed to ensure that a banking entity maintains an adequate level of unencumbered highquality liquid assets that can be converted into cash to meet its liquidity needs for a 30day time horizon under an acute liquidity stress scenario specified by supervisors The LCR measures the ratio of a firms highquality liquid assets to its projected net outflows Starting July 1 2016 the Company Centurion Bank and American Express Bank were required to calculate the LCR each business day and maintain a minimum ratio of 90 percent increasing to 100 percent on January 1 2017 As of December 31 2016 the Company Centurion Bank and American Express Bank were in compliance with the requirements of the LCR rule Beginning in April 2018 we will be required to disclose certain LCR calculation data and other information on a quarterly basis A second standard provided for in the Basel III liquidity framework referred to as the net stable funding ratio NSFR requires a minimum amount of longerterm funding based on the assets and activities of banking entities The LCR and NSFR requirements may cause banking entities generally to increase their holdings of cash US Treasury securities and other sovereign debt as a proportion of total assets andor increase the proportion of longerterm debt Federal banking regulators issued a proposed rule in May 2016 that is scheduled to become effective on January 1 2018 to implement the NSFR for advanced approaches banking organizations such as the Company The NSFR would also apply to Centurion Bank and American Express Bank The proposed rule requires that available stable funding be no less than required stable funding for the Company Centurion Bank and American Express Bank as each such measure is calculated under the proposed rule We would be required to regularly monitor the NSFR and correct any shortfalls as well as publicly report certain information related to the NSFR Prompt Corrective Action The Federal Deposit Insurance Act FDIA requires among other things that federal banking regulators take prompt corrective action in respect of FDICinsured depository institutions such as Centurion Bank and American Express Bank that do not meet minimum capital requirements The FDIA establishes five capital categories for FDICinsured banks well capitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized The FDIA imposes progressively more restrictive constraints on operations management and capital distributions depending on the capital category in which an institution is classified In order to be considered well capitalized Centurion Bank and American Express Bank must maintain CET1 Tier 1 capital Total capital and Tier 1 leverage ratios of 65 percent 80 percent 100 percent and 50 percent respectively Under the FDIA each of Centurion Bank and American Express Bank could be prohibited from accepting brokered deposits ie deposits raised through thirdparty brokerage networks or offering interest rates on any deposits significantly higher than the prevailing rate in its normal market area or nationally depending upon where the deposits are solicited unless 1 it is well capitalized or 2 it is adequately capitalized and receives a waiver from the FDIC A significant amount of our outstanding US retail deposits have been raised through thirdparty brokerage networks and such deposits are considered brokered deposits for bank regulatory purposes If a federal regulator determines that we are in an unsafe or unsound condition or that we are engaging in unsafe or unsound banking practices the regulator may reclassify our capital category or otherwise place restrictions on our ability to accept or solicit brokered deposits Resolution Planning We are required to prepare and provide to regulators a plan for the rapid and orderly resolution of the Company under the US Bankruptcy Code in the event of material distress or failure This resolution planning requirement may as a practical matter present additional constraints on our structure operations and business strategy and on transactions and business arrangements between our bank and nonbank subsidiaries because we must consider the impact of these matters on our ability to prepare and submit a resolution plan that demonstrates that we may be resolved under the Bankruptcy Code in a rapid and orderly manner If the Federal Reserve and the FDIC determine that our plan is not credible and we fail to cure the deficiencies we may be subject to more stringent capital leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on our growth activities or operations or may ultimately be required to divest certain assets or operations to facilitate an orderly resolution Orderly Liquidation Authority The Company could become subject to the Orderly Liquidation Authority OLA a resolution regime under which the Treasury Secretary may appoint the FDIC as receiver to liquidate a systemically important financial company if the Company is in danger of default and is determined to present a systemic risk to US financial stability As under the FDIC resolution model under the OLA the FDIC has broad power as receiver Substantial differences exist however between the OLA and the FDIC resolution model for depository institutions including the right of the FDIC under the OLA to disregard the strict priority of creditor claims in limited circumstances the use of an administrative claims procedure to determine creditor claims as opposed to the judicial procedure used in bankruptcy proceedings and the right of the FDIC to transfer claims to a bridge entity The OLA is separate from the Companys resolution plan discussed in Resolution Planning 8 Table of Contents The FDIC has developed a strategy under OLA referred to as the single point of entry or SPOE strategy under which the FDIC would resolve a failed financial holding company by transferring its assets including shares of its operating subsidiaries and potentially very limited liabilities to a bridge holding company utilize the resources of the failed financial holding company to recapitalize the operating subsidiaries and satisfy the claims of unsecured creditors of the failed financial holding company and other claimants in the receivership by delivering securities of one or more new financial companies that would emerge from the bridge holding company Under this strategy management of the failed financial holding company would be replaced and its shareholders and creditors would bear the losses resulting from the failure FDIC Powers upon Insolvency of Insured Depository Institutions If the FDIC is appointed the conservator or receiver of Centurion Bank or American Express Bank the FDIC has the power 1 to transfer any of the depository institutions assets and liabilities to a new obligor without the approval of the depository institutions creditors 2 to enforce the terms of the depository institutions contracts pursuant to their terms or 3 to repudiate or disaffirm any contract or lease to which the depository institution is a party the performance of which is determined by the FDIC to be burdensome and the disaffirmation or repudiation of which is determined by the FDIC to promote the orderly administration of the depository institution In addition the claims of holders of US deposit liabilities and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC against an insured depository institution would be afforded priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution including claims of debt holders of the institution and depositors in nonUS offices in the liquidation or other resolution of the institution by a receiver As a result whether or not the FDIC ever sought to repudiate any debt obligations of Centurion Bank or American Express Bank the debt holders and depositors in nonUS offices would be treated differently from and could receive substantially less if anything than the depositors in US offices of the depository institution Other Banking Regulations Source of Strength The Company is required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks and may be required to commit capital and financial resources to support Centurion Bank andor American Express Bank Such support may be required at times when absent this requirement the Company otherwise might determine not to provide it Capital loans by the Company to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary banks In the event of the Companys bankruptcy any commitment by the Company to a federal banking regulator to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment CrossGuarantee Liability Under the crossguarantee provision of the Financial Institutions Reform Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 FIRREA Centurion Bank and American Express Bank may be liable to the FDIC with respect to any loss incurred or reasonably anticipated to be incurred by the FDIC in connection with the default of or FDIC assistance to any commonly controlled insured depository institution Centurion Bank and American Express Bank are commonly controlled within the meaning of the FIRREA crossguarantee provision A depository institutions liability for a crossguarantee claim of the FDIC generally has priority in right of payment to any obligation of the depository institution to its holding company or other affiliates Transactions Between Centurion Bank or American Express Bank and Their Respective Affiliates Certain transactions including loans and credit extensions from Centurion Bank and American Express Bank between Centurion Bank and American Express Bank on the one hand and their affiliates including the Company TRS and their nonbank subsidiaries on the other hand are subject to quantitative and qualitative limitations collateral requirements and other restrictions imposed by statute and regulation Transactions subject to these restrictions are generally required to be made on an armslength basis FDIC Deposit Insurance and Insurance Assessments Centurion Bank and American Express Bank accept deposits that are insured by the FDIC up to the applicable limits Under the FDIA the FDIC may terminate the insurance of an institutions deposits upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law regulation rule order or condition imposed by the FDIC We do not know of any practice condition or violation that might lead to termination of deposit insurance at either of our insured depository institution subsidiaries The FDICs deposit insurance fund is funded by assessments on insured depository institutions which are subject to adjustment by the FDIC 9 Table of Contents Community Reinvestment Act Centurion Bank and American Express Bank are subject to the CRA which imposes affirmative ongoing obligations on depository institutions to meet the credit needs of their local communities including low and moderateincome neighborhoods consistent with the safe and sound operation of the institution Other Enhanced Prudential Standards The Federal Reserve has not yet finalized prudential requirements mandated by DoddFrank regarding early remediation requirements for large bank holding companies experiencing financial distress and single counterparty credit limits similar to banklevel lending limits but as proposed applicable to bank holding companies and controlled subsidiaries on a combined basis for large bank holding companies Consumer Financial Products Regulation In the United States our marketing and sale of consumer financial products and our compliance with certain federal consumer financial laws are supervised and examined by the CFPB which has broad rulemaking and enforcement authority over providers of credit savings and payment services and products and authority to prevent unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices In addition a number of US states have significant consumer credit protection and disclosure laws in certain cases more stringent than US federal laws US federal law also regulates abusive debt collection practices Bankruptcy and debtor relief laws can affect our ability to collect amounts owed to us The review of products and practices to assess compliance and prevent unfair deceptive or abusive conduct will be a continuing focus of the CFPB and regulators more broadly as well as our own internal reviews For example federal banking regulators have recently announced they are conducting horizontal reviews of banking sales practices and we are cooperating with regulators in those reviews In October 2012 the Company TRS Centurion Bank and American Express Bank reached settlements with several bank regulators relating to certain aspects of our US consumer card practices In December 2013 TRS Centurion Bank and American Express Bank reached settlements with the FDIC OCC and CFPB to resolve regulatory reviews of marketing and billing practices related to several credit card addon products Internal and regulatory reviews have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in changes to our practices products and procedures substantial restitution to our Card Members and increased costs related to regulatory oversight supervision and examination Such reviews may also result in additional regulatory actions including civil money penalties On May 5 2016 the CFPB issued a proposed rule that if enacted would among other changes require that our consumer arbitration clause not apply to cases filed in court as class actions unless and until class certification is denied or the class claims are dismissed The CFPB set a 90day period for comment and the rule would become effective 211 days after publication in the Federal Register and apply to all agreements entered into after that date On July 28 2016 the CFPB outlined proposals that would set forth additional requirements for thirdparty debt collection agencies which we use in the ordinary course of business This proposal is part of a rulemaking process that is not expected to result in a final rule if any becoming effective before 2018 In 2003 the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council issued guidance on credit card account management and loss allowance practices Centurion Bank and American Express Bank regularly evaluate and discuss the guidance with their respective regulators and as a result may refine their practices from time to time based on regulatory input The guidance has not had nor do we expect it to have any material impact on our businesses or practices As an issuer of stored valueprepaid products we are regulated in the United States under the money transmitter or sale of check laws in effect in most states We are also required by the laws of many states to comply with unclaimed and abandoned property laws under which we must pay to states the face amount of any Travelers Cheque or prepaid card that is uncashed or unredeemed after a period of time depending on the type of product In October 2016 the CFPB finalized regulatory standards for prepaid cards including uniform disclosures certain protections for consumers and other requirements In countries outside the United States we have seen an increase in regulatory focus in relation to a number of key areas impacting our cardissuing businesses particularly consumer protection such as the EU the United Kingdom and Canada responsible lending such as Australia Mexico New Zealand and Singapore and privacy and data protection such as Europe Australia Canada Mexico and Singapore Regulators in a number of countries are shifting their focus from just ensuring compliance with local rules and regulations toward paying greater attention to the product design and operation with a focus on customers and outcomes Regulators expectations of firms in relation to their compliance risk and control frameworks continue to increase and regulators are placing significant emphasis on a firms systems and controls relating to the identification and resolution of issues 10 Table of Contents Payments Regulation The operation of card networks is subject to increasing focus in various countries in which we operate Legislators and regulators have focused on the fees merchants pay to accept cards including the way bankcard network members collectively set the interchange that is the fee paid by the bankcard merchant acquirer to the card issuer in payment networks like Visa and MasterCard as well as the rules contract terms and practices governing merchant card acceptance Although unlike the Visa and MasterCard networks the American Express network does not have interchange fees or collectively set fees or rules antitrust actions and government regulation relating to merchant pricing or terms of merchant rules and contracts could affect all networks directly or indirectly as well as adversely impact consumers and merchants Among other things lower interchange andor merchant discount revenue can be expected to lead card issuers either to look to reduce costs by scaling back or eliminating rewards services or benefits to cardholders and other customers or to look for other sources of revenue from consumers such as higher annual card fees or interest charges In certain countries such as certain Member States in the EU and Australia merchants are permitted by law to surcharge card purchases While surcharging continues to be actively considered in certain jurisdictions the benefits to customers have not been apparent in countries that have allowed it and in some cases regulators are addressing concerns about excessive surcharging by merchants Surcharging particularly where it disproportionately impacts American Express Card Members which is known as differential surcharging as well as other steering practices that are permitted by regulation in some countries could have a material adverse effect on us if it becomes widespread In addition to the EU payments legislation and the Australia payments regulation discussed below we see regulation of the payments industry in other countries For example in Mexico the central bank adopted rules for the regulation of payment instruments and the authorization of payment clearinghouses including requirements on nondiscrimination and access however closedloop networks such as American Express are exempt as are our licensing arrangements provided that volumes under these arrangements fall below a certain sector share as do currently our GNS volumes in Mexico In Canada regulators have prompted the major international card networks to make voluntary commitments on pricing specifically interchange fee levels in the case of American Express our commitment extends to maintaining current pricing practices whereby issuer rates received by GNS partners are agreed to bilaterally with each partner rather than multilaterally and merchant pricing is simple transparent and valuebased with the same rate for the acquiring of credit and charge card transactions for a particular merchant regardless of the type of card that is presented In Malaysia the central bank introduced rules that impose caps on interchange fees permit steering by merchants and cobadging of debit cards with other card networks and require issuers to offer cardholders the option of taking up a basic card product with minimal or no cardholder incentives or rewards and at zero or nominal cost to the cardholder In some countries governments have established regulatory regimes that require international card networks to be locally licensed andor to localize aspects of their operations For example card network operators in India must obtain authorization from the Reserve Bank of India which has broad power under the Payment and Settlement Systems Act 2007 to regulate the membership and operations of card networks In Hong Kong the local monetary authority is implementing a new regulatory framework under which it is considering which card payment systems to designate for supervision In Russia card network operators must be authorized by the central bank and newly enacted regulation requires networks to place security deposits with the central bank process all local transactions using governmentowned infrastructure and ensure that local transaction data remains within the country Governments in some countries also provide resources or protection to select domestic payment card networks For example China recently adopted new regulation that will permit foreign card networks to operate domestically in the country for the first time subject to licensing capital and other requirements The development and enforcement of these and other similar laws regulations and policies in international markets may adversely affect our ability to compete effectively in such countries and maintain and extend our global network European Union Payments Legislation In the EU the Payment Services Directive PSD adopted in 2007 and subsequently implemented by EU Member States prescribes common rules across the EU for licensing and supervision of payment services providers including card issuers and merchant acquirers and for their conduct of business with customers The objective of the PSD is to facilitate the operation of a single internal payments market in the EU through harmonization of EU Member State laws governing payment services One provision of the PSD permits merchants to surcharge subject to disclosure requirements but also allows individual Member States to override this rule by prohibiting or limiting surcharging To date the Member States are split on whether they prohibit or permit surcharging with countries such as the United Kingdom which for a number of years has permitted it for credit card purchases the Netherlands and Spain permitting it and other countries such as France Italy and Sweden prohibiting it All Member States permit merchants to offer discounts for particular forms of payment The Consumer Rights Directive CRD prohibits merchants from surcharging card purchases more than the merchants cost of acceptance in those Member States that permit surcharging pursuant to the PSD The CRD provides no guidance to merchants on how to assess the cost of acceptance or take into account the relative value of different payment methods A costbased limit on surcharging could result in merchants imposing higher surcharges on American Express transactions if in the absence of clear guidance a surcharging merchant took the position that the cost of American Express acceptance is higher than other payment cards 11 Table of Contents In 2015 the EU adopted legislation in two parts covering a wide range of topics across the payments industry The first part was an EUwide regulation on interchange fees the Interchange Fee Regulation the second consisted of revisions to the PSD the PSD2 The Interchange Fee Regulation was formally adopted in April 2015 The substantive terms as adopted include the following  Price caps  Interchange fees on consumer card transactions in the EU are capped as of December 2015 generally at 20 basis points for debit and prepaid cards and 30 basis points for credit and charge cards with the possibility of lower caps in some instances Although we do not have interchange fees and three party networks such as American Express are exempt from the application of the caps the regulation provides that three party networks should be treated as four party networks such as Visa and MasterCard which have interchange fees when they license thirdparty providers to issue cards andor acquire merchants or when they issue cards with a cobrand partner or through an agent This means for example the caps could be interpreted to apply to elements of the financial arrangements agreed to between us and each of our GNS partners in the EU which may undermine our ability to attract and retain GNS partners While the discount rates we agree to with merchants are not capped the interchange caps have exerted and will likely continue to exert downward pressure on merchant fees across the industry including our discount rates We have brought a legal challenge and seek a ruling from the EU Court of Justice to clarify the interpretation and validity of the application of price caps as well as other regulatory measures in circumstances where three party networks issue cards with a cobrand partner or through an agent The Interchange Fee Regulation excludes commercial card transactions from the scope of the caps  Card acceptance terms  Antisteering and honorallcards rules across all card networks including nondiscrimination and honorallcards provisions in our card acceptance agreements are prohibited with some exceptions Removal of these provisions creates significant risk of customer confusion and Card Member dissatisfaction which would result in harm to the American Express brand The prohibition on antisteering rules took effect immediately upon effectiveness of the regulation the prohibition on honorallcards rules took effect in June 2016  Network licensing  In December 2015 the geographic scope of the network licenses that we agree to with our GNS partners in the EU was amended to cover the entire EU in order to meet the requirements of the regulation This allows GNS partners to actively pursue their American Express business throughout the EU including countries where we or other GNS partners are present and may undermine the value of licenses granted to some GNS partners to date which have been subject to varying levels of exclusivity to incentivize development of the American Express business in relation to a particular country  Separation of network processing  From June 2016 card networks are required to separate their network processing functions in which transactions between different issuers and acquirers are processed for authorization clearing and settlement This provision does not generally apply to three party payment networks such as American Express but may be deemed applicable for example where a different GNS issuer and acquirer is involved in a transaction which represents a very small percentage of transactions on our network  Cobadging of cards  From June 2016 a single card may bear the brand of multiple networks and be used to process transactions on any of those networks Merchants may install automatic mechanisms in pointofsale equipment to prioritize selection of a particular network subject to override by the cardholder These provisions may harm the American Express brand insofar as GNS issuing partners will be able to offer multiple networks on a single card and merchants may program their pointofsale equipment to prioritize selection of another network on such cards The PSD2 was adopted on November 25 2015 and was published in the Official Journal of the European Union on December 23 2015 Each Member State has until January 2018 to transpose the PSD2 into national law Among other terms the published text of PSD2 includes provisions that will i further regulate surcharging so that transactions falling in scope of the interchange caps could not be surcharged but transactions falling outside the scope of the caps could be surcharged up to cost subject potentially to the decision of an individual Member State to prohibit surcharging altogether and ii require all networks including three party payment networks that operate with licensing arrangements such as our GNS business to establish objective proportionate and nondiscriminatory criteria under which a financial institution may access the network for example as a licensed issuer or acquirer The revised surcharging regulation may increase instances of differential surcharging of our cards prompt customer and merchant confusion as to which transactions may be surcharged and lead to Card Member dissatisfaction The access requirements will undermine the flexibility and discretion we have had to date in deciding with whom to partner and together with requirements in the Interchange Fee Regulation significantly impact the value and sustainability of our GNS business in Europe We have brought a legal challenge and seek a ruling from the EU Court of Justice to clarify the interpretation and validity of the application of access requirements in circumstances where three party networks rely on a cobrand partner or through an agent 12 Table of Contents Australia Payments Regulation Following a formal review of the regulatory framework for card payments in Australia the Reserve Bank of Australia adopted new regulations on May 26 2016 including the following  Interchange caps  As of July 1 2017 the interchange fee paid on Visa and MasterCard credit transactions must not exceed a weightedaverage benchmark of 050 percent across all transactions with a maximum interchange fee cap of 080 percent for each individual credit card transaction  The inclusion of our GNS business in Australia under interchange regulation which subjects GNS payments to bank partners to the same interchange caps and regulations that apply to Visa and MasterCard credit card transactions in Australia effective July 1 2017  Broadening the definition of interchange fees to include any fees paid by networks to cardissuing banks as incentives to issue cards as well as any other net payments made to card issuers  Increasing the frequency of periodic weightedaverage benchmark calculations from every three years to quarterly to confirm compliance with the interchange caps In determining compliance all transactions at Australian merchants including commercial card transactions but excluding those on foreignissued cards will be taken into consideration  Changing the rules on merchant surcharging to limit surcharging to the actual cost of card acceptance paid to the merchant acquirer as recorded on the merchant statement issued by the merchant acquirer the changes took effect as of September 1 2016 for large merchants and will take effect September 1 2017 for other merchants The inclusion of our GNS business under interchange regulation may undermine our ability to attract and retain GNS partners While the discount rates we agree to with merchants are not capped the interchange caps once effective will likely exert downward pressure on merchant fees across the industry including our discount rates Privacy and Data Protection Regulatory and legislative activity in the areas of privacy data protection and information security continues to increase worldwide We have established and continue to maintain policies that provide a framework for compliance with applicable privacy data protection and information security laws meet evolving customer privacy expectations and support and enable business innovation and growth Our regulators including regulatory examiners are increasingly focused on ensuring that our privacy data protection and information securityrelated policies and practices are adequate to inform customers of our data collection use sharing andor security practices to provide them with choices if required about how we use and share their information and to appropriately safeguard their personal information In the United States certain of our businesses are subject to the privacy disclosure and information security provisions of the GrammLeachBliley Act GLBA and its implementing regulations and guidance Among other things the GLBA imposes certain limitations on our ability to share consumers nonpublic personal information with nonaffiliated third parties requires us to provide certain disclosures to consumers about our data collection sharing and security practices and affords customers the right to opt out of disclosure of their personal financial information to nonaffiliated third parties with limited exceptions and requires us to develop implement and maintain a written comprehensive information security program containing safeguards that are appropriate to the size and complexity of our business the nature and scope of our activities and the sensitivity of customer information that we process The GLBA does not preempt state laws that afford greater privacy protections to consumers Various states also have adopted laws rules andor regulations pertaining to privacy andor information security including certain potentially applicable financial privacy laws such as a law in effect in California data security andor data disposal requirements including potentially applicable requirements adopted in states such as Massachusetts and Nevada online privacy laws such as a law in effect in California and laws relating to the confidentiality of certain types of data such as laws governing certain healthrelated information andor Social Security numbers for which there are also potentially applicable federal laws rules regulations andor guidance as well Certain of these requirements may apply to the personal information of our employees andor contractors as well as our customers Various US federal banking regulators and 47 US states the District of Columbia Guam Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands have enacted data security breach notification requirements with varying levels of individual consumer regulator andor law enforcement notification in certain circumstances in the event of a data security breach Data breach notification laws are also becoming more prevalent in other parts of the world where we operate including Germany Japan Mexico South Korea and Taiwan In many countries that have yet to impose data breach notification requirements regulators have increasingly used the threat of significant sanctions and penalties by data protection authorities to encourage voluntary breach notification 13 Table of Contents We are also subject to certain privacy data protection and information security laws in other countries in which we operate including countries in the EU Australia Canada Japan Hong Kong Mexico and Singapore some of which are more stringent than those in the United States We have also seen some countries institute laws requiring incountry data processing andor incountry storage of the personal data of its citizens Compliance with such laws could result in higher technology administrative and other costs for us and could limit our ability to optimize the use of our closedloop data In Europe the European Directive 9546EC the Data Protection Directive providing for the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data will be replaced by the EU General Data Protection Regulation EU GDPR as of May 2018 The EU GDPR includes among other things a requirement for prompt notice of data breaches in certain circumstances to data subjects and supervisory authorities applying uniformly across sectors and the EU with significant fines for noncompliance The EU GDPR also requires companies processing personal data of individuals residing in the EU regardless of the location of the company to comply with EU privacy and data protection rules We generally rely on our binding corporate rules as the primary method for lawfully transferring data from our European affiliates to our affiliates in the United States and elsewhere globally In addition the European Directive 200258EC the ePrivacy Directive will continue to set out requirements for the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector The ePrivacy Directive places restrictions on among other things the sending of unsolicited marketing communications as well as on the collection and use of data about internet users In 2015 the European Central Bank and the European Banking Authority enacted secondary legislation focused on security breaches strong customer authentication and information securityrelated policies Likewise the Commission adopted a network information security directive to be implemented into national laws by the Member States PSD2 also contains regulatory requirements on strong customer authentication and measures to prevent security incidents AntiMoney Laundering Sanctions and AntiCorruption Compliance We are subject to significant supervision and regulation and an increasingly stringent enforcement environment with respect to compliance with antimoney laundering AML sanctions and anticorruption laws and regulations in the United States and in other jurisdictions in which we operate Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs and policies and procedures for AML sanctions and anticorruption compliance could have serious financial legal and reputational consequences AntiMoney Laundering American Express is subject to a significant number of AML laws and regulations as a result of being a financial company headquartered in the United States as well as having a global presence In the United States the majority of AML requirements are derived from the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act and the accompanying regulations issued by the US Department of the Treasury collectively referred to as the Bank Secrecy Act as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 the Patriot Act In Europe AML requirements are largely the result of countries transposing the 3rd EU AntiMoney Laundering Directive and preceding EU AntiMoney Laundering Directives into local laws and regulations The 4th EU AntiMoney Laundering Directive was published in June 2015 and required each Member State to transpose the new Directive into national law within two years Numerous other countries such as Argentina Australia Canada and Mexico have also enacted or proposed new or enhanced AML legislation and regulations applicable to American Express Among other things these laws and regulations require us to establish AML programs that meet certain standards including in some instances expanded reporting particularly in the area of suspicious transactions and enhanced information gathering and recordkeeping requirements Any errors failures or delays in complying with federal state or foreign AML and counterterrorist financing laws could result in significant criminal and civil lawsuits penalties and forfeiture of significant assets or other enforcement actions Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation The United States has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries nationals and others The United States prohibits US persons from engaging with individuals and entities identified as Specially Designated Nationals such as terrorists and narcotics traffickers These prohibitions are administered by the US Department of the Treasurys Office of Foreign Assets Control OFAC and are typically known as the OFAC rules The OFAC rules prohibit US persons from engaging in financial transactions with or relating to the prohibited individual entity or country require the blocking of assets in which the individual entity or country has an interest and prohibit transfers of property subject to US jurisdiction including property in the possession or control of US persons to such individual entity or country Blocked assets eg property or bank deposits cannot be paid out withdrawn set off or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC We maintain a global sanctions program designed to ensure compliance with OFAC requirements Failure to comply with such requirements could subject us to serious legal and reputational consequences including criminal penalties 14 Table of Contents Pursuant to Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 which added Section 13r to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended the Exchange Act an issuer is required to disclose in its annual or quarterly reports as applicable whether it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities transactions or dealings relating to Iran or with individuals or entities designated pursuant to certain Executive Orders Disclosure is generally required even where the activities transactions or dealings were conducted outside the United States by nonUS affiliates in compliance with applicable law and whether or not the activities are sanctionable under US law During the year ended December 31 2016 American Express Travel  Lifestyle Services obtained two visas from Iranian embassies in connection with certain travel arrangements on behalf of clients In addition American Express Global Business Travel GBT and certain entities that may be considered affiliates of GBT have informed us that during the year ended December 31 2016 they obtained approximately 300 visas from Iranian embassies and consulates around the world in connection with certain travel arrangements on behalf of clients and booked 10 reservations at hotels that may be owned directly or indirectly or may otherwise affiliated with the Government of Iran We had negligible gross revenues and net profits attributable to these transactions and intend to continue to engage in these activities on a limited basis so long as such activities are permitted under US law AntiCorruption We are subject to complex international and US anticorruption laws and regulations including the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act the FCPA the UK Bribery Act and other laws that prohibit the making or offering of improper payments The FCPA makes it illegal to corruptly offer or provide anything of value to foreign government officials political parties or political party officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or an improper advantage The FCPA also requires us to strictly comply with certain accounting and internal controls standards In recent years enforcement of the FCPA has become more intense The UK Bribery Act also prohibits commercial bribery and the receipt of a bribe and makes it a corporate offense to fail to prevent bribery by an associated person in addition to prohibiting improper payments to foreign government officials Failure of the Company our subsidiaries employees contractors or agents to comply with the FCPA the UK Bribery Act and other laws can expose us andor individual employees to investigation prosecution and to potentially severe criminal and civil penalties Compensation Practices Our compensation practices are subject to oversight by the Federal Reserve The federal banking regulators guidance on sound incentive compensation practices sets forth three key principles for incentive compensation arrangements that are designed to help ensure that incentive compensation plans do not encourage imprudent risktaking and are consistent with the safety and soundness of banking organizations The three principles provide that a banking organizations incentive compensation arrangements should 1 provide incentives that appropriately balance risk and financial results in a manner that does not encourage employees to expose their organizations to imprudent risks 2 be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management and 3 be supported by strong corporate governance including active and effective oversight by the organizations board of directors Any deficiencies in our compensation practices that are identified by the Federal Reserve or other banking regulators in connection with its review of our compensation practices may be incorporated into our supervisory ratings which can affect our ability to make acquisitions or perform other actions Enforcement actions may be taken against us if our incentive compensation arrangements or related riskmanagement control or governance processes are determined to pose a risk to our safety and soundness and we have not taken prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies In May 2016 the federal banking regulators the SEC the Federal Housing Finance Agency and the National Credit Union Administration reproposed a rule originally proposed in 2011 pursuant to DoddFrank on incentivebased compensation practices The reproposed rule would apply deferral downward adjustment and forfeiture and clawback requirements to incentivebased compensation arrangements granted to senior executive officers and significant risktakers of covered institutions with specific requirements varying based on the asset size of the covered institution and the category of employee Under the reproposed rule we would be required to defer at least 50 percent of a senior executives qualifying incentivebased compensation and 40 percent of a significant risktakers qualifying incentivebased compensation for at least three years Further we would be required to make subject to forfeiture all unvested deferred incentivebased compensation of any senior executive officer or significant risktaker including unvested deferred amounts awarded under longterm incentive plans The reproposed rule would also require clawback provisions that at a minimum allow the covered institution to recover incentivebased compensation from a current or former senior executive officer or significant risktaker for seven years following the date on which compensation vests if the covered institution determines the senior executive officer or significant risktaker engaged in misconduct that resulted in significant financial or reputational harm fraud or intentional misrepresentation of information used to determine incentive compensation If these or other regulations are adopted in a form similar to what has been proposed they will impose limitations on the manner in which we may structure compensation for our employees which is likely to adversely affect our ability to hire retain and motivate key employees 15 Table of Contents EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE COMPANY Set forth below in alphabetical order is a list of all our executive officers as of February 17 2017 including

You should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10K Based on the information currently known to us we believe the following information identifies the most significant risk factors affecting us However the risks and uncertainties we face are not limited to those described below Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business If any of the following risks and uncertainties develop into actual events or if the circumstances described in the risks and uncertainties occur or continue to occur these events or circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations These events could also have a negative effect on the trading price of our securities Strategic Business and Competitive Risks Difficult conditions in the business and economic environment as well as political conditions in the United States and elsewhere may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations Our results of operations are materially affected by economic market political and social conditions in the United States and abroad Uneven global economic growth has had and may continue to have an adverse effect on us in part because we are very dependent upon the level of consumer and business activity and the demand for payment and financing products A prolonged period of slow economic growth or deterioration in economic conditions could change customer behaviors including spending on our cards and the ability and willingness of Card Members to pay amounts owed to us Travel and entertainment expenditures which comprised approximately 25 percent of our US billed business during 2016 for example are sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending levels and also tend to decline during general economic downturns Geopolitical trends toward nationalism and protectionism and the weakening or dissolution of international trade pacts may increase the cost of or otherwise interfere with conducting business Further economic or political instability in certain regions or countries could negatively affect consumer and business spending including in other parts of the world Factors such as consumer spending business investment government spending interest rates tax rates fuel and other energy costs the volatility and strength of the capital markets inflation and deflation all affect the economic environment and ultimately our profitability An economic downturn characterized by higher unemployment lower family income lower consumer spending lower demand for credit lower corporate earnings or lower business investment is likely to materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition Furthermore such factors may cause our earnings credit metrics and margins to fluctuate and diverge from expectations of analysts and investors who may have differing assumptions regarding their impact on our business adversely affecting andor increasing the volatility of the trading price of our common shares 17 Table of Contents Our operating results may suffer because of substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the payments industry The payments industry is highly competitive and we compete with charge credit and debit card networks issuers and acquirers paperbased transactions eg cash and checks bank transfer models eg wire transfers and ACH as well as evolving and growing alternative payment and financing providers We believe Visa and MasterCard are larger than we are in most countries As a result card issuers and acquirers on the Visa and MasterCard networks may be able to benefit from the dominant position scale resources marketing and pricing of those networks Some of our competitors have developed or may develop substantially greater financial and other resources than we have including larger cash reserves may offer richer value propositions or a wider range of programs and services than we offer or may use more effective advertising marketing or crossselling strategies to acquire and retain more customers capture a greater share of spending and borrowings attain and develop more attractive cobrand card programs and maintain greater merchant acceptance than we have We may not be able to compete effectively against these threats or respond or adapt to changes in consumer spending habits as effectively as our competitors We expect expenses such as Card Member rewards and Card Member services expenses to continue to increase as we improve our value propositions for Card Members including in response to increased competition Spending on our cards could continue to be impacted by increasing consumer usage of charge credit and debit cards issued on other networks as well as adoption of payment systems based on ACH or other payment mechanisms To the extent other payment mechanisms systems and products continue to successfully expand our discount revenues and our ability to access transaction data through our closedloop network could be negatively impacted If we are not able to differentiate ourselves from our competitors drive value for our customers andor effectively grow in areas such as mobile and online payments and emerging technologies we may not be able to compete effectively against these threats To the extent we expand into new business areas and new geographic regions we may face competitors with more experience and more established relationships with relevant customers regulators and industry participants which could adversely affect our ability to compete We may face additional compliance and regulatory risk to the extent that we expand into new business areas and we may need to dedicate more expense time and resources to comply with regulatory requirements than our competitors particularly those that are not regulated financial institutions In addition companies that control access to consumer and merchant payment method choices through digital wallets mobile applications or at the point of sale could choose not to accept or could suppress use of our products or could restrict our access to our customers and transaction data Such companies could also require payments from us to participate in such digital wallets and applications impacting our profitability on transactions Laws and business practices that favor local competitors require card transactions to be routed over domestic networks or prohibit or limit foreign ownership of certain businesses could slow our growth in international regions Further expanding our service offerings adding customer acquisition channels and forming new partnerships could have higher cost structures than our current arrangements and could adversely impact our average discount rate or dilute our brand Many of our competitors are subject to different and in some cases less stringent legislative and regulatory regimes More restrictive laws and regulations that do not apply to all of our competitors can put us at a competitive disadvantage including prohibiting us from engaging in certain transactions regulating our contract terms and practices governing merchant card acceptance or adversely affecting our cost structure See  Ongoing legal proceedings regarding provisions in our merchant contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business result in additional litigation andor arbitrations subject us to substantial monetary damages and damage our reputation and brand  for a discussion of the potential impact on our ability to compete effectively if ongoing legal proceedings limit our ability to prevent merchants from engaging in various actions to discriminate against our card products We face substantial and increasingly intense competition for partner relationships which could result in a loss or renegotiation of these arrangements that could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations In the ordinary course of our business we enter into different types of contractual arrangements with business partners in a variety of industries For example we have partnered with Delta Air Lines as well as many others globally to offer cobranded cards for consumers and small businesses and through our Membership Rewards program we have partnered with businesses in many industries including the airline industry to offer benefits to Card Member participants Competition for relationships with key business partners is very intense and there can be no assurance we will be able to grow or maintain these partner relationships Establishing and retaining attractive cobrand card partnerships is particularly competitive among card issuers and networks as these partnerships typically have highspending loyal customers Our entire cobrand portfolio accounted for approximately 18 percent of our worldwide billed business for the year ended December 31 2016 Card Member loans related to our cobrand portfolio accounted for approximately 34 percent of our worldwide Card Member loans as of December 31 2016 18 Table of Contents Cobrand arrangements are entered into for a fixed period generally ranging from five to eight years and will terminate in accordance with their terms including at the end of the fixed period unless extended or renewed at the option of the parties or upon early termination as a result of an event of default or otherwise We face the risk that we could lose partner relationships even after we have invested significant resources time and expense in acquiring and developing the relationships The volume of billed business could decline and Card Member attrition could increase in each case significantly as a result of the termination of one or more cobrand partnership relationships In addition some of our cobrand arrangements provide that upon expiration or termination the cobrand partner may purchase or designate a third party to purchase the loans generated with respect to its program which could result in a significant decline in our Card Member loans outstanding For example our US cobrand relationship with Costco ended in 2016 and we sold the outstanding Card Member loans associated with the Costco portfolio In 2016 Starwood Hotels  Resorts Worldwide with which we have a cobrand partnership was acquired by Marriott International which has a cobrand partnership with a competing card issuer We also face the risk that existing relationships will be renegotiated with less favorable terms for us as competition for such relationships continues to increase We make payments to our cobrand partners which can be significant based primarily on the amount of Card Member spending and corresponding rewards earned on such spending and under certain arrangements on the number of accounts acquired and retained The amount we pay to our cobrand partners has increased particularly in the United States and may continue to increase as arrangements are renegotiated due to increasingly intense competition for cobrand partners among card issuers and networks We may also choose to not continue certain cobrand relationships The loss of business partners whether by nonrenewal at the end of the contract period such as the end of our relationship with Costco in the United States in 2016 or early termination as the result of a merger or otherwise such as the withdrawal of American Airlines in 2014 from our Airport Club Access program for Centurion  and Platinum Card  Members or the renegotiation of existing partnerships with terms that are significantly worse for us could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations In addition any publicity associated with the loss of any of our key business partners could harm our reputation making it more difficult to attract and retain Card Members and merchants and could weaken our negotiating position with our remaining and prospective business partners We face continued intense competitive pressure that may impact the prices we charge merchants that accept our cards for payment for goods and services Unlike our competitors in the payments industry that rely on revolving credit balances to drive profits our business model is focused on Card Member spending Discount revenue which represents fees generally charged to merchants when Card Members use their cards to purchase goods and services on our network is primarily driven by billed business volumes and is our largest single revenue source In recent years we experienced some reduction in our global weighted average merchant discount rate and have been under increasing pressure including as a result of regulatorymandated reductions to competitors pricing to reduce merchant discount rates and undertake other repricing initiatives We also face pressure from competitors that have other sources of income or lower expense bases that can make their pricing more attractive to key business partners and merchants Merchants are also able to negotiate incentives and pricing concessions from us as a condition to accepting our cards As merchants consolidate and become even larger we may have to increase the amount of incentives andor concessions we provide to certain merchants which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations Competitive and regulatory pressures on pricing could make it difficult to offset the costs of these incentives We further expect some erosion of our average merchant discount rate as we seek to increase merchant acceptance We may not be successful in significantly expanding merchant acceptance or offsetting rate erosion with volumes at new merchants In addition differentiated payment models and technologies from nontraditional players in the alternative payments space and the regulatory and litigation environment could pose challenges to our traditional payment model and adversely impact our average discount rate Some merchants also continue to invest in their own payment solutions such as proprietarybranded mobile wallets using both traditional and new technology platforms If merchants are able to drive broad consumer adoption and usage it could adversely impact our merchant discount rate and billed business volumes A continuing priority of ours is to drive greater and differentiated value to our merchants which if not successful could negatively impact our discount revenue and financial results If the average merchant discount rate declines more than expected we will need to find ways to offset the financial impact by increasing billed business volumes increasing other sources of revenue such as feebased revenue or interest income or both We may not succeed in maintaining merchant discount rates or offsetting the impact of declining merchant discount rates particularly in the current regulatory environment which could materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability and therefore our ability to invest in innovation and in valueadded services for merchants and Card Members 19 Table of Contents Surcharging or steering by merchants could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations In certain countries such as Australia and certain Member States in the EU merchants are expressly permitted by law to surcharge card purchases The number of countries in the EU that permit surcharging and the potential for selective surcharging of American Express cards could increase following adoption of new EUwide regulation as discussed in Supervision and Regulation  Payments Regulation In Australia we have seen merchant surcharging on American Express cards in certain merchant categories and in some cases the surcharge is greater than that applied to Visa and MasterCard cards a practice that is known as differential surcharging We also encounter merchants that accept our cards but tell their customers that they prefer to accept another type of payment or otherwise seek to suppress use of our cards Our Card Members value the ability to use their cards where and when they want to and we therefore take steps to meet our Card Members expectations and to protect the American Express brand by prohibiting this form of discrimination subject to local legal requirements If surcharging steering or other forms of discrimination become widespread American Express cards and credit and charge cards generally could become less desirable to consumers which could result in a decrease in cardsinforce and transaction volumes The impact could vary depending on such factors as the manner in which a surcharge is levied how Card Members are steered to other card products or payment forms at the point of sale and whether and to what extent these actions are applied to other payment cards including whether it varies depending on the type of card network acquirer or issuer Discrimination against American Express cards could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations particularly to the extent it disproportionately impacts our Card Members If we are not able to invest successfully in and compete at the leading edge of technological developments across all our businesses our revenue and profitability could be negatively affected Our industry is subject to rapid and significant technological changes In order to compete in our industry we need to continue to invest across all areas of our business including in transaction processing data management and analytics customer interactions and communications alternative payment mechanisms and risk management and compliance systems Incorporating new technologies into our products and services may require substantial expenditures and take considerable time and ultimately may not be successful We expect that new technologies in the payments industry will continue to emerge and these new technologies may be superior to or render obsolete the technologies we currently use in our products and services The process of developing new products and services enhancing existing products and services and adapting to technological changes and evolving industry standards is complex costly and uncertain and any failure by us to anticipate customers changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly impede our ability to compete effectively Consumer and merchant adoption is a key competitive factor and our competitors may develop products platforms or technologies that become more widely adopted than ours In addition we may underestimate the time and expense we must invest in new products and services before they generate material revenues if at all Our ability to develop acquire or access competitive technologies or business processes on acceptable terms may also be limited by intellectual property rights that third parties including competitors and potential competitors may assert In addition our ability to adopt new technologies may be inhibited by a need for industrywide standards a changing legislative and regulatory environment the need for internal product and engineering expertise resistance to change from Card Members or merchants or the complexity of our systems We may not be successful in our efforts to promote card usage through marketing and promotion merchant acceptance and Card Member rewards and services or to effectively control the costs of such investments both of which may impact our profitability Revenue growth is dependent on increasing consumer and business spending on our cards and growing card lending balances We have been spending at elevated levels on a number of growth initiatives over the past several years including to attract new Card Members reduce Card Member attrition and capture a greater share of customers total spending and borrowings There can be no assurance that our investments to acquire Card Members and increase usage of our cards will be effective For example we may not be successful in developing and issuing new and enhanced cards or customers may not accept our new products and services which would negatively impact our results of operations Increasing spending on our cards also depends on our continued expansion of merchant acceptance of our cards If the rate of merchant acceptance growth slows or reverses itself our business could suffer Another way we invest in customer value is through our Membership Rewards program as well as other Card Member benefits Any significant change in or failure by management to reasonably estimate actual redemptions of Membership Rewards points and associated redemption costs could adversely affect our profitability In addition many credit card issuers have instituted rewards and cobrand programs and may introduce programs and services that are similar to or more attractive than ours 20 Table of Contents We may not be able to costeffectively manage and expand Card Member benefits including containing the growth of marketing promotion rewards and Card Member services expenses in the future If such expenses continue to increase beyond our expectations we will need to find ways to offset the financial impact by increasing payments volume increasing other areas of revenues such as feebased revenues or both We may not succeed in doing so particularly in the current regulatory environment Our brand and reputation are key assets of our Company and our business may be affected by how we are perceived in the marketplace Our brand and its attributes are key assets of ours and we believe our continued success depends on our ability to preserve grow and leverage the value of our brand Our ability to attract and retain consumer and small business Card Members and corporate clients is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our level of service trustworthiness business practices merchant acceptance financial condition and other subjective qualities Negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters  even if related to seemingly isolated incidents and whether or not factually correct  could erode trust and confidence and damage our reputation among existing and potential Card Members and corporate clients which could make it difficult for us to attract new Card Members and customers and maintain existing ones Negative public opinion could result from actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities or circumstances including card practices regulatory compliance and the use and protection of customer information and from actions taken by regulators or others in response to such conduct Social media channels can also cause rapid widespread reputational harm to our brand Our brand and reputation may also be harmed by actions taken by third parties that are outside our control For example any shortcoming of a thirdparty vendor merchant acquirer or GNS partner may be attributed by Card Members and merchants to us thus damaging our reputation and brand value The lack of acceptance or suppression of card usage by merchants can also negatively impact perceptions of our brand and our products lower overall transaction volume and increase the attractiveness of other payment products or systems Adverse developments with respect to our industry may also by association negatively impact our reputation or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny or litigation against us Furthermore as a corporation with headquarters and operations located in the United States a negative perception of the United States arising from its political or other positions could harm the perception of our company and our brand Although we monitor developments for areas of potential risk to our reputation and brand negative perceptions or publicity could materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability A significant operating disruption a major information security incident or an increase in fraudulent activity using our cards could lead to reputational damage to our brand and significant legal regulatory and financial exposure and could reduce the use and acceptance of our charge and credit cards We and other third parties process transmit and store account information in connection with our charge and credit cards and prepaid products and in the normal course of our business we collect analyze and retain significant volumes of certain types of personally identifiable and other information pertaining to our customers and employees Global financial institutions like us have experienced a significant increase in information security risk in recent years and will likely continue to be the target of increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks including computer viruses malicious or destructive code social engineering attacks including phishing and impersonation denial of service and security attacks For example we and other US financial services providers have been the targets of distributed denialofservice attacks from sophisticated third parties Our networks and systems are subject to constant attempts to identify and exploit potential vulnerabilities in our operating environment with intent to disrupt our business operations and capture destroy or manipulate various types of information relating to corporate trade secrets customer information including Card Member and loyalty program account information employee information and other sensitive business information including acquisition activity financial results and intellectual property There are a number of motivations for cyber threat actors including criminal activities such as fraud identity theft and ransom corporate or nationstate espionage political agendas public embarrassment with the intent to cause financial or reputational harm intent to disrupt information technology systems and to expose and exploit potential security and privacy vulnerabilities in corporate systems and websites As outsourcing specialization of functions and technology innovation within the payments industry increase more third parties are involved in processing transactions using our cards and there is a risk the confidentiality integrity privacy andor security of data held by third parties or to which they have access including merchants that accept our cards and our business partners may be compromised which could lead to unauthorized transactions on our cards and costs associated with responding to such an incident 21 Table of Contents We develop and maintain systems and processes aimed at detecting and preventing information security incidents and fraudulent activity which require significant investment maintenance and ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies and regulatory requirements change and as efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated Despite our efforts the possibility of information security incidents malicious social engineering fraudulent or other malicious activities and human error or malfeasance cannot be eliminated entirely Risks associated with each of these remain including the unauthorized disclosure release gathering monitoring misuse modification loss or destruction of confidential proprietary and other information including account data information or negative impact to online accounts and systems These risks will likely evolve as new technology is deployed For example with the increased use of EMV technology we may see a decrease in traditional fraud risk but sophisticated fraudsters may develop new ways to commit fraud and we may see an increase in online fraud and impersonation and identity takeover attempts Our information technology systems including our transaction authorization clearing and settlement systems and data centers may experience service disruptions or degradation because of technology malfunction sudden increases in customer transaction volume natural disasters accidents power outages internet outages telecommunications failures fraud denialofservice and other cyberattacks terrorism computer viruses physical or electronic breakins or similar events Service disruptions could prevent access to our online services and account information compromise Company or customer data and impede transaction processing and financial reporting Inadequate infrastructure in lesserdeveloped countries could also result in service disruptions which could impact our ability to do business in those countries If our information technology systems experience a significant disruption or breach or if actual or perceived fraud levels or other illegal activities involving our cards or customer online accounts were to rise due to an information security incident at a business partner merchant or other market participant employee error malfeasance or otherwise it could lead to the loss of data or data integrity regulatory investigations and intervention such as mandatory card reissuance increased litigation including class action litigation remediation and response costs greater concerns of customers andor business partners relating to the privacy and security of their data and reputational and financial damage to our brand which could reduce the use and acceptance of our cards and have a material adverse impact on our business If such disruptions or breaches are not detected quickly their effect could be compounded Information security incidents and other actual or perceived failures to maintain confidentiality integrity privacy andor data protection including leaked business data may also disrupt our operations undermine our competitive advantage through the disclosure of sensitive company information divert management attention and resources and negatively impact the assessment of us and our subsidiaries by banking regulators and rating agencies Successful cyberattacks or data breaches at other large financial institutions large retailers or other market participants whether or not we are impacted could lead to a general loss of customer confidence that could negatively affect us including harming the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures or harming the reputation of the financial system in general which could result in reduced use of our products and services Although we have insurance for losses related to cyber risks and attacks and information security and privacy liability it may not be sufficient to offset the impact of a material loss event We have agreements with business partners in a variety of industries including the airline industry that represent a significant portion of our business We are exposed to risks associated with these industries including bankruptcies liquidations restructurings consolidations and alliances of our partners and the possible obligation to make payments to our partners We may be obligated to make or accelerate payments to certain business partners such as cobrand partners and merchants upon the occurrence of certain triggering events such as i our economic condition deteriorating such that our senior unsecured debt rating is downgraded significantly below investment grade by SP and Moodys ii our ceasing to have a public debt rating or iii a shortfall in certain performance levels If we are not able to effectively manage these triggering events we could unexpectedly have to make payments to these partners which could have a negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations We are also exposed to risk from bankruptcies liquidations insolvencies financial distress restructurings consolidations and other similar events that may occur in any industry representing a significant portion of our billed business which could negatively impact particular card products and services and billed business generally and our financial condition and results of operations For example we could be materially impacted if we were obligated to or elected to reimburse Card Members for products and services purchased from merchants that have ceased operations or stopped accepting our cards The airline industry which represents a significant portion of our billed business has undergone bankruptcies restructurings consolidations and other similar events in the past The airline industry accounted for approximately 8 percent of our worldwide billed business for the year ended December 31 2016 Our largest airline cobrand portfolio American Express Delta SkyMiles accounted for approximately 7 percent of our worldwide billed business for the year ended December 31 2016 and approximately 20 percent of worldwide Card Member loans as of December 31 2016 We have credit risk to the airline industry to the extent we protect Card Members against nondelivery of goods and services such as where we have remitted payment to an airline for a Card Member purchase of tickets that have not yet been used or flown If we are unable to collect the amount from the airline we may bear the loss for the amount credited to the Card Member 22 Table of Contents For additional information relating to the general risks related to the airline industry see Risk Management  Institutional Credit Risk  Exposure to the Airline Industry under MDA We may not be successful in realizing the benefits associated with our acquisitions strategic alliances joint ventures and investment activity and our business and reputation could be negatively impacted We have acquired a number of businesses and have made a number of strategic investments and continue to evaluate potential transactions These transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully identify and secure future acquisition candidates on terms and conditions that are acceptable to us or complete proposed acquisitions and investments which could impair our growth Our failure to successfully integrate acquired companies businesses or technologies into our existing operations could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition or investment incur unanticipated liabilities and harm our business generally Joint ventures including our GBT JV and minority investments inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations thereby potentially increasing the financial legal operational andor compliance risks associated with the joint venture or minority investment In addition we may be dependent on joint venture partners controlling shareholders or management who may have business interests strategies or goals that are inconsistent with ours Business decisions or other actions or omissions of the joint venture partner controlling shareholders or management may adversely affect the value of our investment result in litigation or regulatory action against us and otherwise damage our reputation and brand We rely on thirdparty providers of various computer systems platforms and other services integral to the operations of our businesses These third parties may act in ways that could harm our business We rely on thirdparty service providers merchants processors aggregators GNS partners and other third parties for services that are integral to our operations including the timely transmission of accurate information across our global network If a service provider or other third party fails to provide the data quality communications capacity or services we require as a result of natural disaster operational disruptions terrorism hacking or other cybersecurity incidents or any other reason the failure could interrupt or compromise the quality of our services to customers We are subject to the risk that activities of our thirdparty service providers may adversely affect our business A failure to exercise adequate oversight over thirdparty service providers including compliance with service level agreements or regulatory or legal requirements could result in regulatory actions fines sanctions or economic and reputational harm to us There is also a risk the confidentiality integrity privacy andor security of data held by third parties or communicated over thirdparty networks or platforms could become compromised which could significantly harm our business even if the attack or breach does not impact our systems In addition the management of multiple thirdparty vendors increases our operational complexity and decreases our control Our business is subject to the effects of geopolitical events weather natural disasters and other conditions Geopolitical events terrorist attacks natural disasters severe weather conditions floods health pandemics intrusion into or degradation of our infrastructure by hackers and other catastrophic events can have a negative effect on our business Because of our proximity to the World Trade Center our headquarters were damaged as a result of the terrorist attacks of September 11 2001 Similar events or other disasters or catastrophic events in the future and events impacting other sectors of the economy including the telecommunications and energy sectors could have a negative effect on our businesses and infrastructure including our information technology systems Because we derive a portion of our revenues from travelrelated spending our business is sensitive to safety concerns related to travel and tourism limitations on travel and mobility and healthrelated risks In addition disruptions in air travel and other forms of travel can result in the payment of claims under travel interruption insurance policies that we offer and if such disruptions to travel are prolonged they can materially adversely affect overall travelrelated spending If the conditions described above or similar ones result in widespread or lengthy disruptions to travel they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations Card Member spending may also be negatively impacted in areas affected by natural disasters or other catastrophic events The impact of such events on the overall economy may also adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 23 Table of Contents The exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union could adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition Our business in the United Kingdom and elsewhere may be negatively impacted by the uncertainty regarding the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union commonly referred to as Brexit including from a deterioration of consumer and business activity in the United Kingdom and other countries and general uncertainty in the overall business environment in which we operate We may experience increased volatility in the value of the pound sterling and the euro further strengthening the US dollar which could continue to adversely impact our results of operations from our international activities The exit itself could also have a negative impact on the United Kingdom and other European economies which could adversely affect spending on our cards and the ability and willingness of Card Members to pay amounts owed to us As of December 31 2016 the EMEA region constituted approximately 10 percent of our worldwide billed business It is unclear at this stage the financial trade and legal implications of Brexit For example we may no longer be able to provide payment services from the United Kingdom to EU Member States which may require changes to the structure of our business operations in Europe Our success is dependent in part upon our executive officers and other key personnel and the loss of key personnel could materially adversely affect our business Our success depends in part on our executive officers and other key personnel Our senior management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace The market for qualified individuals is highly competitive and we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel or candidates to replace or succeed members of our senior management team or other key personnel Changes in immigration and work permit laws and regulations or the administration or enforcement of such laws or regulations can also impair our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel As further described in Supervision and Regulation  Compensation Practices our compensation practices are subject to review and oversight by the Federal Reserve and the compensation practices of our US bank subsidiaries are subject to review and oversight by the FDIC and the OCC This regulatory review and oversight could further affect our ability to attract and retain our executive officers and other key personnel The loss of key personnel could materially adversely affect our business Legal Regulatory and Compliance Risks Ongoing legal proceedings regarding provisions in our merchant contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business result in additional litigation andor arbitrations subject us to substantial monetary damages and damage our reputation and brand The US Department of Justice DOJ and certain states attorneys general brought an action against us alleging that the provisions in our card acceptance agreements with merchants that prohibit merchants from discriminating against our card products at the point of sale violate the US antitrust laws Visa and MasterCard which were also defendants in the DOJ and state action entered into a settlement agreement and have been dismissed as parties pursuant to that agreement which was approved by the court The settlement enjoins Visa and MasterCard from entering into contracts that prohibit merchants from engaging in various actions to steer cardholders to other card products or payment forms at the point of sale Following a nonjury trial in the DOJ case the trial court found that the challenged provisions were anticompetitive and on April 30 2015 the court issued a final judgment entering a permanent injunction Following our appeal of this judgment on September 26 2016 the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the trial court decision and directed the trial court to enter a judgment for American Express which occurred on January 25 2017 The DOJ and states may seek further review of this ruling We are also a defendant in a number of actions and arbitration proceedings including proposed class actions filed by merchants that challenge the nondiscrimination and honorallcards provisions in our card acceptance agreements and seek damages A description of these legal proceedings is contained in Legal Proceedings An adverse outcome in these proceedings against us could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations require us to change our merchant agreements in a way that could expose our cards to increased merchant steering and other forms of discrimination that could impair the Card Member experience result in additional litigation andor arbitrations impose substantial monetary damages and damage our reputation and brand Even if we were not required to change our merchant agreements changes in Visas and MasterCards policies or practices as a result of legal proceedings lawsuit settlements or regulatory actions could result in changes to our business practices and materially and adversely impact our profitability Our business is subject to comprehensive government regulation and supervision which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition We are subject to comprehensive government regulation and supervision in jurisdictions around the world which significantly affects our business and has the potential to restrict the scope of our existing businesses increase our costs of doing business limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities or make our products and services more expensive for customers Regulatory oversight and supervision of our businesses are generally designed to protect consumers and enhance financial stability and are not designed to protect our security holders 24 Table of Contents The current environment of additional regulation enhanced supervision efforts and increased and unpredictable regulatory investigations and enforcement is likely to continue to result in changes to our business practices products and procedures and potentially additional penalties andor restitution payments to Card Members In addition new laws or regulations or changes in the enforcement of existing laws or regulations applicable to our businesses could impact the profitability of our business activities limit our ability to pursue business opportunities or adopt new technologies require us to change certain of our business practices or alter our relationships with partners merchants and Card Members or affect retention of our key personnel Such changes also may require us to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition To the extent that different regulatory systems impose overlapping or inconsistent requirements on the conduct of our business we face complexity and additional costs in our compliance efforts If we fail to satisfy regulatory requirements or maintain our financial holding company status our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected and we may be restricted in our ability to take certain capital actions such as declaring dividends or repurchasing outstanding shares or engage in certain activities or acquisitions Additionally our banking regulators have wide discretion in the examination and the enforcement of applicable banking statutes and regulations and may restrict our ability to engage in certain activities or acquisitions or require us to maintain more capital In recent years legislators and regulators have focused on the operation of card networks including interchange fees paid to card issuers in payment networks such as Visa and MasterCard and the fees merchants are charged to accept cards Even where we are not directly regulated regulation of bankcard fees can significantly negatively impact the discount revenue derived from our business including as a result of downward pressure on our discount rate from decreases in competitor pricing in connection with caps on interchange fees In some cases such regulation extends to certain aspects of our business for example GNS arrangements or terms of card acceptance for merchants including terms relating to nondiscrimination and honorallcards We have brought a legal challenge and seek a ruling from the EU Court of Justice to clarify the interpretation and validity of the application of price caps as well as other regulatory measures in circumstances where threeparty networks issue cards with a cobrand partner or through an agent There can be no assurance that our legal challenge will be successful For a description of certain regulations and their impact on us see Supervision and Regulation  Payments Regulation Legislators and regulators around the world are aware of each others approaches to the regulation of the payments industry Consequently a development in one country state or region may influence regulatory approaches in another We are subject to certain provisions of the Bank Secrecy Act as amended by the Patriot Act with regard to maintaining effective AML programs Similar AML requirements apply under the laws of most jurisdictions where we operate Increased regulatory focus in this area could result in additional obligations or restrictions with respect to the types of products and services we may offer to consumers the countries in which our cards may be used and the types of customers and merchants who can obtain or accept our cards Activity such as money laundering or terrorist financing involving our cards could result in enforcement action and our reputation may suffer due to our customers association with certain countries persons or entities or the existence of any such transactions Various regulatory agencies and legislatures are also considering regulations and legislation covering identity theft account management guidelines credit bureau reporting disclosure rules security and marketing that would impact us directly in part due to increased scrutiny of our underwriting and account management standards These new requirements may restrict our ability to issue charge and credit cards or partner with other financial institutions which could adversely affect our revenue growth See Supervision and Regulation for more information about certain laws and regulations to which we are subject Litigation and regulatory actions could subject us to significant fines penalties judgments andor requirements resulting in significantly increased expenses damage to our reputation andor a material adverse effect on our business Businesses in the financial services and payments industries have historically been subject to significant legal actions including class action lawsuits Many of these actions have included claims for substantial compensatory or punitive damages While we have historically relied on our arbitration clause in agreements with customers to limit our exposure to class action litigation there can be no assurance that we will continue to be successful in enforcing our arbitration clause in the future The CFPB issued a proposed rule that if enacted would among other changes require that our consumer arbitration clause not apply to cases filed in court as class actions unless and until class certification is denied or the class claims are dismissed As a result claims of the type we previously arbitrated could be subject to the complexities and costs associated with class action cases The continued focus of merchants on issues relating to the acceptance of various forms of payment may lead to additional litigation and other legal actions Given the inherent uncertainties involved in litigation and the very large or indeterminate damages sought in some matters asserted against us there is significant uncertainty as to the ultimate liability we may incur from litigation matters 25 Table of Contents We have been subject to regulatory actions by the CFPB and other regulators and may continue to be subject to such actions including governmental inquiries investigations and enforcement proceedings in the event of noncompliance or alleged noncompliance with laws or regulations Regulatory action could subject us to significant fines penalties or other requirements resulting in increased expenses limitations or conditions on our business activities and damage to our reputation and our brand which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition We expect that regulators will continue taking formal enforcement actions against financial institutions in addition to addressing supervisory concerns through nonpublic supervisory actions or findings which could involve restrictions on our activities among other limitations that could adversely affect our business We are subject to capital adequacy and liquidity rules and if we fail to meet these rules our business would be adversely affected Failure to meet current or future capital or liquidity requirements including those imposed by the Capital Rules the LCR the NSFR or by regulators in implementing other portions of the Basel III framework and the enhanced supervision requirements of DoddFrank could compromise our competitive position and could result in restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve including limiting our ability to pay dividends repurchase our capital stock invest in our business expand our business or engage in acquisitions There continues to be substantial uncertainty regarding significant portions of the capital and liquidity regime that will apply to us and our US bank subsidiaries As a result the ultimate impact on our longterm capital and liquidity planning and our results of operations is not certain although an increase in our capital and liquid asset levels could lower our return on equity The capital requirements applicable to the Company as a bank holding company and our US bank subsidiaries have been substantially revised to implement the international Basel III framework and are in the process of being phased in These requirements particularly once they are fully phased in require the Company and our US bank subsidiaries to satisfy more stringent capital adequacy standards than in the past As part of our required stress testing both internally and by the Federal Reserve we must continue to comply with applicable capital standards in the adverse and severely adverse economic scenarios published by the Federal Reserve each year To satisfy these requirements it may be necessary for us to hold additional capital in excess of that required by the Capital Rules as they are phased in Compliance with capital adequacy and liquidity rules including the Capital Rules and the LCR requires a material investment of resources An inability to meet regulatory expectations regarding our compliance with applicable capital adequacy and liquidity rules may also negatively impact the assessment of the Company and our US bank subsidiaries by federal banking regulators We continue to progress through the parallel run phase of Basel III advanced approaches implementation Depending on how the advanced approaches are ultimately implemented for our asset types our capital ratios calculated under the advanced approaches may be lower than under the standardized approach In such a case we may need to hold significantly more regulatory capital in order to maintain a given capital ratio There are several recent proposals or potential proposals that could significantly impact the regulatory capital standards and requirements applicable to financial institutions such as the Company and our US bank subsidiaries as well as our ability to meet these requirements The Basel Committee has adopted a framework that would impose a capital buffer on certain banks that may have an important impact on their domestic economies socalled domestic systemically important banks or DSIBs The US banking regulators have not designated any DSIBs in the United States Additionally the Basel Committee has proposed a series of revisions to the standardized approach for credit and operational risk capital requirements If these or other proposals are adopted in the United States and applied to advanced approaches institutions or if we are designated as a DSIB we could be required to hold significantly more capital For more information on capital adequacy requirements see Capital Leverage and Liquidity Regulation under Supervision and Regulation We are subject to restrictions that limit our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our capital stock Our subsidiaries are also subject to restrictions that limit their ability to pay dividends to us which may adversely affect our liquidity We are limited in our ability to pay dividends and repurchase capital stock by our regulators who have broad authority to prohibit any action that would be considered an unsafe or unsound banking practice For example we are subject to a requirement to submit capital plans that include among other things projected dividend payments and repurchases of capital stock to the Federal Reserve for review As part of the capital planning and stress testing process our proposed capital actions are assessed against our ability to satisfy applicable capital requirements in the event of a stressed market environment If the Federal Reserve objects to our capital plan or if we fail to satisfy applicable capital requirements our ability to undertake capital actions may be restricted 26 Table of Contents In addition the Capital Rules include a capital conservation buffer which is being phased in from January 1 2016 through January 1 2019 The Capital Rules also include a countercyclical capital buffer which is currently set at zero but which could be increased by the Federal Reserve in the future These buffers can be satisfied only with CET1 capital If our riskbased capital ratios were to fall below the applicable buffer levels we would face graduated constraints on dividends stock repurchases and other capital distributions based on the amount of the shortfall A failure to increase dividends along with our competitors or any reduction of or elimination of our common stock dividend or share repurchase program would likely adversely affect the market price of our common stock and market perceptions of American Express Our ability to declare or pay dividends on or to purchase redeem or otherwise acquire shares of our common stock will be prohibited subject to certain exceptions in the event that we do not declare and pay in full dividends for the last preceding dividend period of our Series B and Series C preferred stock American Express Company relies on dividends from its subsidiaries for liquidity and federal and state laws limit the amount of dividends that our subsidiaries may pay to the parent company In particular our US bank subsidiaries are subject to various statutory and regulatory limitations on their declaration and payment of dividends These limitations may hinder our ability to access funds we may need to make payments on our obligations make dividend payments on outstanding American Express Company capital stock or otherwise achieve strategic objectives For more information on bank holding company and depository institution dividend restrictions see Dividends and Other Capital Distributions under Supervision and Regulation as well as Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity  Share Repurchases and Dividends under MDA and Note 23 to our Consolidated Financial Statements Regulation in the areas of privacy data protection and information security could increase our costs and affect or limit our business opportunities and how we collect andor use personal information As privacy data protection and information security laws including data localization laws are interpreted and applied compliance costs may increase particularly in the context of ensuring that adequate data protection and data transfer mechanisms are in place In recent years there has been increasing regulatory enforcement and litigation activity in the areas of privacy data protection and information security in the United States and in various countries in which we operate In addition state and federal legislators andor regulators in the United States and other countries in which we operate are increasingly adopting or revising privacy data protection and information security laws that potentially could have significant impact on our current and planned privacy data protection and information securityrelated practices our collection use sharing retention and safeguarding of consumer andor employee information and some of our current or planned business activities New legislation or regulation could increase our costs of compliance and business operations and could reduce revenues from certain business initiatives Moreover the application of existing or new laws to existing technology and practices can be uncertain and may lead to additional compliance risk and cost Compliance with current or future privacy data protection and information security laws relating to consumer andor employee data could result in higher compliance and technology costs and could restrict our ability to fully maximize our closedloop capability or provide certain products and services which could materially and adversely affect our profitability Our failure to comply with privacy data protection and information security laws could result in potentially significant regulatory andor governmental investigations andor actions litigation fines sanctions ongoing regulatory monitoring customer attrition decreases in the use or acceptance of our cards and damage to our reputation and our brand We may not be able to effectively manage the operational and compliance risks to which we are exposed We consider operational risk to be the risk of not achieving business objectives due to inadequate or failed processes or information systems poor data quality human error or the external environment eg natural disasters Operational risk includes among others the risk that employee error or intentional misconduct could result in a material financial misstatement a failure to monitor a third partys compliance with a service level agreement or regulatory or legal requirements or a failure to adequately monitor and control access to data in our systems we grant to thirdparty service providers As processes are changed or new products and services are introduced we may not fully appreciate or identify new operational risks that may arise from such changes Compliance risk arises from the failure to adhere to applicable laws rules regulations and internal policies and procedures Operational and compliance risks can expose us to reputational risks as well as fines civil money penalties or payment of damages and can lead to diminished business opportunities and diminished ability to expand key operations 27 Table of Contents If we are not able to protect our intellectual property our revenue and profitability could be negatively affected We rely on a variety of measures to protect our intellectual property and proprietary information including copyrights trademarks patents and controls on access and distribution These measures may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information or infringement of our intellectual property rights and a resulting loss of competitive advantage In addition competitors or other third parties may allege that our systems processes or technologies infringe on their intellectual property rights Given the complex rapidly changing and competitive technological and business environments in which we operate and the potential risks and uncertainties of intellectual propertyrelated litigation a future assertion of an infringement claim against us could cause us to lose significant revenues incur significant license royalty or technology development expenses or pay significant monetary damages Tax legislative initiatives or assessments by governmental authorities could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition We are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and in various foreign jurisdictions The laws and regulations related to tax matters are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations Although management believes our positions are reasonable we are subject to audit by the Internal Revenue Service in the United States and by tax authorities in all the jurisdictions in which we conduct business operations We are being challenged in a number of countries regarding our application of valueadded taxes VAT to certain transactions While we believe we comply with all applicable VAT and other tax laws rules and regulations in the relevant jurisdictions the tax authorities may determine that we owe additional taxes or apply existing laws and regulations more broadly which could result in a significant increase in liabilities for taxes and interest in excess of accrued liabilities New tax legislative initiatives may be proposed from time to time such as proposals for comprehensive tax reform in the United States which may impact our effective tax rate and could adversely affect our tax positions or tax liabilities In addition unilateral or multijurisdictional actions by various tax authorities including an increase in tax audit activity to address base erosion and profit shifting by multinational companies could also have an adverse impact on our tax liabilities Changes in accounting principles or standards could adversely affect our reported financial results in a particular period even if there are no underlying changes in the economics of the business We are subject to changes in and interpretations of financial accounting matters that govern the measurement of our performance which could change the way we account for certain of our transactions even if we do not change the way in which we transact A change in accounting guidance can have a significant effect on our reported results may retroactively affect previously reported results and could cause fluctuations in our reported results For more information on recently issued accounting standards see Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements Credit Liquidity and Market Risks Our risk management policies and procedures may not be effective Our risk management framework seeks to identify and mitigate risk and appropriately balance risk and return We have established policies and procedures intended to identify monitor and manage the types of risk to which we are subject including credit risk market risk asset liability risk liquidity risk operational risk compliance risk model risk strategic and business risk and reputational risk See Risk Management under MDA for a discussion of the policies and procedures we use to identify monitor and manage the risks we assume in conducting our businesses Although we have devoted significant resources to develop our risk management policies and procedures and expect to continue to do so in the future these policies and procedures as well as our risk management techniques such as our hedging strategies may not be fully effective There may also be risks that exist or develop in the future that we have not appropriately anticipated identified or mitigated As regulations and markets in which we operate continue to evolve our risk management framework may not always keep sufficient pace with those changes If our risk management framework does not effectively identify or mitigate our risks we could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected Management of our risks in some cases depends upon the use of analytical andor forecasting models Although we have a governance framework for model development and independent model validation the modeling methodology could be erroneous or the models could be misused If our decisions are based on incorrect or misused model outputs and reports we may face adverse consequences such as financial loss poor business and strategic decisionmaking or damage to our reputation In addition some decisions our regulators make including those related to our capital distribution plans may be adversely impacted if they perceive the quality of our models to be insufficient 28 Table of Contents We may not be able to effectively manage individual or institutional credit risk or credit trends that can affect spending on card products and the ability of customers and partners to pay us which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition We are exposed to both individual credit risk principally from consumer and small business Card Member receivables and loans and institutional credit risk from merchants GNS partners GCS clients loyalty coalition partners and treasury and investment counterparties Third parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons Country regional and political risks can contribute to credit risk Our ability to assess creditworthiness may be impaired if the criteria or models we use to manage our credit risk become less predictive of future losses which could cause our losses to rise and have a negative impact on our results of operations Rising delinquencies and rising rates of bankruptcy are often precursors of future writeoffs and may require us to increase our reserve for loan losses We expect that some modest gradual upward pressure on our writeoff rates will cause provisions to grow faster than loans in 2017 Higher writeoff rates and the resulting increase in our reserve for loan losses adversely affect our profitability and the performance of our securitizations and may increase our cost of funds Although we make estimates to provide for credit losses in our outstanding portfolio of loans and receivables these estimates may not be accurate In addition the information we use in managing our credit risk may be inaccurate or incomplete Although we regularly review our credit exposure to specific clients and counterparties and to specific industries countries and regions that we believe may present credit concerns default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to foresee or detect such as fraud In addition our ability to manage credit risk may be adversely affected by legal or regulatory changes such as bankruptcy laws and minimum payment regulations Increased credit risk whether resulting from underestimating the credit losses inherent in our portfolio of loans and receivables deteriorating economic conditions particularly in the United States where approximately 75 percent of our revenues are generated changes in our mix of business or otherwise could require us to increase our provisions for losses and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition Adverse financial market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs access to capital and cost of capital We need liquidity to pay merchants operating and other expenses interest on debt and dividends on capital stock and to repay maturing liabilities The principal sources of our liquidity are payments from Card Members cash flows from our investment portfolio cash and cash equivalents proceeds from the issuance of unsecured medium and longterm notes and asset securitizations and direct and thirdparty sourced deposits securitized borrowings through our secured financing facilities a committed bank borrowing facility and the Federal Reserve discount window Our ability to obtain financing in the debt capital markets for unsecured term debt and asset securitizations is dependent on market conditions Disruptions uncertainty or volatility across the financial markets as well as adverse developments affecting our competitors and the financial industry generally could negatively impact market liquidity and limit our access to funding required to operate our business Such market conditions may also limit our ability to replace in a timely manner maturing liabilities satisfy regulatory capital requirements and access the funding necessary to grow our business In some circumstances we may incur an unattractive cost to raise capital which could decrease profitability and significantly reduce financial flexibility For a further discussion of our liquidity and funding needs see Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity  Funding Programs and Activities under MDA Any reduction in our and our subsidiaries credit ratings could increase the cost of our funding from and restrict our access to the capital markets and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition Rating agencies regularly evaluate us and our subsidiaries and their ratings of our and our subsidiaries longterm and shortterm debt are based on a number of factors including financial strength as well as factors not within our control including conditions affecting the financial services industry generally and the wider state of the economy Our and our subsidiaries ratings could be downgraded at any time and without any notice by any of the rating agencies which could among other things adversely limit our access to the capital markets and adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we and our subsidiaries are able to obtain funding Adverse currency fluctuations and foreign exchange controls could decrease earnings we receive from our international operations and impact our capital During 2016 approximately 25 percent of our total revenues net of interest expense were generated from activities outside the United States We are exposed to foreign exchange risk from our international operations and accordingly the revenue we generate outside the United States is subject to unpredictable fluctuations if the values of other currencies change relative to the US dollar which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations For the year ended December 31 2016 foreign currency movements relative to the US dollar negatively impacted our net revenues of 321 billion by approximately 04 billion as the US dollar strengthened against many currencies 29 Table of Contents Foreign exchange regulations or capital controls might restrict or prohibit the conversion of other currencies into US dollars or our ability to transfer them Political and economic conditions in other countries could also impact the availability of foreign exchange for the payment by the local card issuer of obligations arising out of local Card Members spending outside such country and for the payment of card bills by Card Members who are billed in a currency other than their local currency Substantial and sudden devaluation of local Card Members currency can also affect their ability to make payments to the local issuer of the card in connection with spending outside the local country The occurrence of any of these circumstances could further impact our results of operations Continuing concerns regarding the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political circumstances in individual Eurozone countries may cause the value of the euro to fluctuate more widely than in the past and could lead to the reintroduction of individual currencies in one or more Eurozone countries or in more extreme circumstances the possible dissolution of the euro currency entirely If there is a significant devaluation of the euro and we are unable to hedge our foreign exchange exposure to the euro the value of our eurodenominated assets and liabilities would be correspondingly reduced when translated into US dollars for inclusion in our financial statements Similarly the reintroduction of certain individual country currencies or the complete dissolution of the euro could adversely affect the value of our eurodenominated assets and liabilities The reintroduction of individual country currencies would require us to reconfigure our billing and other systems to reflect individual country currencies in place of the euro Implementing such changes could be costly and failures in the currency reconfiguration could cause disruptions in our normal business operations In addition foreign currency derivative instruments to hedge our market exposure to reintroduced currencies may not be immediately available or may not be available on terms that are acceptable to us The potential developments regarding Europe and the euro or market perceptions concerning these and related issues could continue to have an adverse impact on consumer and business behavior in Europe and globally which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations Interest rate increases could materially adversely affect our earnings If the rate of interest we pay on our borrowings increases more than the rate of interest we earn on our loans our net interest yield and consequently our net income could fall Our interest expense was approximately 17 billion for the year ended December 31 2016 A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would have resulted in a decrease to our annual net interest income of approximately 193 million as of December 31 2016 In addition interest rate changes may affect customer behavior such as impacting the loan balances Card Members carry on their credit cards or their ability to make payments as higher interest rates lead to higher payment requirements further impacting our results of operations For a further discussion of our interest rate risk see Risk Management  Market Risk Management Process under MDA The value of our assets or liabilities may be adversely impacted by economic political or market conditions Market risk includes the loss in value of portfolios and financial instruments due to adverse changes in market variables which could negatively impact our financial condition We held approximately 32 billion of investment securities as of December 31 2016 In the event that actual default rates of these investment securities were to significantly change from historical patterns due to challenges in the economy or otherwise it could have a material adverse impact on the value of our investment portfolio Defaults or economic disruptions even in countries or territories in which we do not have material investment exposure conduct business or have operations could adversely affect us An inability to accept or maintain deposits due to market demand or regulatory constraints could materially adversely affect our liquidity position and our ability to fund our business Our US bank subsidiaries accept deposits from individuals through thirdparty brokerage networks as well as directly from consumers through American Express Personal Savings and use the proceeds as a source of funding As of December 31 2016 we had approximately 523 billion in total US retail deposits of which a significant amount had been raised through thirdparty brokerage networks We face strong competition with regard to deposits and pricing and product changes may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain costeffective deposit balances If we are required to offer higher interest rates to attract or maintain deposits our funding costs will be adversely impacted Our ability to obtain deposit funding and offer competitive interest rates on deposits is also dependent on capital levels of our US bank subsidiaries The FDIAs brokered deposit provisions and related FDIC rules in certain circumstances prohibit banks from accepting or renewing brokered deposits and apply other restrictions such as a cap on interest rates that can be paid See Prompt Corrective Action under Supervision and Regulation for additional information 30 Table of Contents While Centurion Bank and American Express Bank were considered well capitalized as of December 31 2016 and had no restrictions regarding acceptance of brokered deposits or setting of interest rates there can be no assurance they will continue to meet this definition The Capital Rules particularly when fully phased in require bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries to maintain substantially more capital with a greater emphasis on common equity Additionally our regulators can adjust the requirements to be well capitalized at any time and have authority to place limitations on our deposit businesses including the interest rates we pay on deposits An inability to attract or maintain deposits in the future could materially adversely affect our liquidity position and our ability to fund our business ITEM 1B UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS Not applicable ITEM 2 PROPERTIES Our principal executive offices are in a 22 million square foot building located in lower Manhattan on land leased from the Battery Park City Authority for a term expiring in 2069 We have an approximately 49 percent ownership interest in the building and an affiliate of Brookfield Financial Properties owns the remaining approximately 51 percent interest in the building We also lease space in the building from Brookfields affiliate Other owned or leased principal locations include American Express offices in Sunrise and Fort Lauderdale Florida Phoenix Arizona Salt Lake City Utah Mexico City Mexico Sydney Australia Singapore Gurgaon India Manila Philippines and Brighton England the American Express data centers in Phoenix Arizona and Greensboro North Carolina the headquarters for American Express Services Europe Limited in London England and the Amex Bank of Canada and Amex Canada Inc headquarters in Toronto Ontario Canada Generally we lease the premises we occupy in other locations We believe the facilities we own or occupy suit our needs and are well maintained ITEM 3 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS In the ordinary course of business we are subject to various pending and potential legal actions arbitration proceedings claims investigations examinations information gathering requests subpoenas inquiries and matters relating to compliance with laws and regulations collectively legal proceedings We do not believe we are a party to nor are any of our properties the subject of any legal proceeding that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or liquidity However in light of the uncertainties involved in such matters including the fact that some pending legal proceedings are at preliminary stages and seek an indeterminate amount of damages it is possible that the outcome of legal proceedings could have a material impact on our results of operations In addition it is possible that significantly increased merchant steering or other actions impairing the Card Member experience as a result of the DOJ or merchant cases described later in this section could have a material adverse effect on our business Certain legal proceedings involving us or our subsidiaries are described below For additional information see Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements Antitrust Matters In 2010 the DOJ along with Attorneys General from Arizona Connecticut Hawaii Hawaii has since withdrawn its claim Idaho Illinois Iowa Maryland Michigan Missouri Montana Nebraska New Hampshire Ohio Rhode Island Tennessee Texas Utah and Vermont filed a complaint in the US District Court for the Eastern District of New York against us MasterCard International Incorporated and Visa Inc alleging a violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act the DOJ case The complaint included allegations that provisions in our merchant agreements prohibiting merchants from steering a customer to use another networks card or another type of generalpurpose card antisteering and nondiscrimination contractual provisions violate the antitrust laws The complaint sought a judgment permanently enjoining us from enforcing our nondiscrimination contractual provisions The complaint did not seek monetary damages 31 Table of Contents Following a nonjury trial in the DOJ case the trial court found that the challenged provisions were anticompetitive and on April 30 2015 the court issued a final judgment entering a permanent injunction Following our appeal of this judgment on September 26 2016 the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the trial court decision and directed the trial court to enter a judgment for American Express Following denial of rehearing en banc by the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit the trial court entered judgment for American Express on January 25 2017 The DOJ and states may seek further review by the US Supreme Court In addition to the DOJ case individual merchant cases and a putative class action collectively captioned In re American Express AntiSteering Rules Antitrust Litigation II  are pending in the Eastern District of New York against us alleging that our antisteering provisions in merchant card acceptance agreements violate US antitrust laws The individual merchant cases seek damages in unspecified amounts and injunctive relief These matters including a trial previously scheduled in the individual merchant cases had been stayed pending resolution of the appeal in the DOJ case Further proceedings are anticipated Individual merchants have initiated arbitration proceedings raising similar claims concerning the antisteering provisions in our card acceptance agreements and seeking damages We are vigorously defending against those claims In July 2004 we were named as a defendant in another putative class action filed in the Southern District of New York and subsequently transferred to the Eastern District of New York captioned The Marcus Corporation v American Express Company et al  in which the plaintiffs allege an unlawful antitrust tying arrangement between certain of our charge cards and credit cards in violation of various state and federal laws The plaintiffs in this action seek injunctive relief and an unspecified amount of damages In December 2013 we announced a proposed settlement of the Marcus case and the putative class action challenging our antisteering provisions The settlement which provides for certain injunctive relief for the proposed classes received preliminary approval in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York On August 4 2015 the court denied final approval of the settlement further proceedings are anticipated On March 8 2016 plaintiffs BR Supermarket Inc dba Milams Market and Grove Liquors LLC on behalf of themselves and others filed a suit captioned BR Supermarket Inc dba Milams Market et al v Visa Inc et al  for violations of the Sherman Antitrust Act the Clayton

networks other issuing banks and EMVCo LLC Plaintiffs allege that the defendants through EMVCo conspired to shift liability for fraudulent faulty and otherwise rejected consumer credit card transactions from themselves to merchants after the implementation of EMV chip payment terminals Plaintiffs seek damages and injunctive relief On June 24 2016 the court granted our motion to transfer to the Southern District of New York the claims brought against us by merchants who accept American Express cards The court also granted plaintiffs leave to file an amended complaint and on September 30 2016 denied our motion to dismiss as to claims brought by merchants who do not accept American Express cards Corporate Matters On July 30 2015 plaintiff Plumbers and Steamfitters Local 137 Pension Fund on behalf of themselves and other purchasers of American Express stock filed a suit captioned Plumbers and Steamfitters Local 137 Pension Fund v American Express Co Kenneth I Chenault and Jeffrey
