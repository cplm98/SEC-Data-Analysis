industry with card networks issuers and acquirers paperbased transactions eg cash and checks bank transfer models eg wire transfers and Automated Clearing House or ACH as well as evolving and growing alternative mechanisms systems and products that leverage new technologies business models and customer relationships to create payment or financing solutions The payments industry continues to undergo dynamic changes in response to evolving technologies consumer habits and merchant needs some of which have accelerated as a result of the pandemic such as an increased shift to ecommerce and demand for contactless payments As a card issuer we compete with financial institutions that issue generalpurpose credit and debit cards We also encounter competition from businesses that issue private label cards operate mobile wallets or extend credit We face intense competition for cobrand relationships as both card issuer and network competitors have targeted key business partners with attractive value propositions Our global card network competes in the global payments industry with other card networks including among others China UnionPay Visa Mastercard JCB Discover and Diners Club International which is owned by Discover We are the fourth largest generalpurpose card network globally based on purchase volume behind China UnionPay Visa and Mastercard In addition to such networks a range of companies globally including merchant acquirers processors and web and mobilebased payment platforms eg Alipay PayPal and Venmo as well as regional payment networks such as the National Payments Corporation of India carry out some activities similar to those performed by our GMNS business The principal competitive factors that affect the cardissuing merchant and network businesses include  The features value and quality of the products and services including customer care rewards programs partnerships benefits and digital and mobile services and the costs associated with providing such features and services  Reputation and brand recognition  The number spending characteristics and credit performance of customers  The quantity diversity and quality of the establishments where the cards can be used  The attractiveness of the value proposition to card issuers merchant acquirers cardholders corporate clients and merchants including the relative cost of using or accepting the products and services and capabilities such as fraud prevention and data analytics  The number and quality of other cards and other forms of payment and financing available to customers  The success of marketing and promotional campaigns  The speed of innovation and investment in systems technologies and product and service offerings  The nature and quality of expense management tools electronic payment methods and data capture and reporting capabilities particularly for business customers  The security of cardholder merchant and network partner information Another aspect of competition is the dynamic and rapid growth of alternative payment and financing mechanisms systems and products which include payment aggregators digital payment and electronic wallet platforms pointofsale lenders realtime settlement and processing systems financial technology companies digital currencies developed by both governments and the private sector blockchain and similar distributed ledger technologies prepaid systems and gift cards and systems linked to customer accounts or that provide payment solutions Various competitors are integrating more financial services into their product offerings and competitors are seeking to attain the benefits of closedloop loyalty and rewards functionalities such as ours 9 Table of Contents In addition to the discussion in this

products 10 Table of Contents SUPERVISION AND REGULATION Overview We are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision in jurisdictions around the world and the costs of compliance are substantial The financial services industry is subject to rigorous scrutiny high regulatory expectations a range of regulations and a stringent and unpredictable enforcement environment Governmental authorities have focused and we believe will continue to focus considerable attention on reviewing compliance by financial services firms with laws and regulations and as a result we continually work to evolve and improve our risk management framework governance structures practices and procedures Reviews to assess compliance with laws and regulations by governmental authorities as well as our own internal reviews have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in changes to our products practices and procedures restitution to our customers and increased costs related to regulatory oversight supervision and examination We have also been subject to regulatory actions and may continue to be the subject of such actions including governmental inquiries investigations enforcement proceedings and the imposition of fines or civil money penalties in the event of noncompliance or alleged noncompliance with laws or regulations In addition legislators and regulators in various countries in which we operate have focused on the offering of consumer financial products and the operation of payment networks resulting in changes to certain practices or pricing of card issuers merchant acquirers and payment networks and in some cases the establishment of broad and ongoing regulatory oversight regimes See Risk FactorsLegal Regulatory and Compliance Risks for a discussion of the potential impact legislative and regulatory changes may have on our results of operations and financial condition Banking Regulation Federal and state banking laws regulations and policies extensively regulate the Company which for purposes of this section refers to American Express Company as a bank holding company TRS and our US bank subsidiary American Express National Bank AENB Both the Company and TRS are subject to comprehensive consolidated supervision regulation and examination by the Federal Reserve and AENB is supervised regulated and examined by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency OCC The Company and its subsidiaries are also subject to the rulemaking enforcement and examination authority of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau CFPB Banking regulators have broad examination and enforcement power including the power to impose substantial fines limit dividends and other capital distributions restrict operations and acquisitions and require divestitures any of which could compromise our competitive position Many aspects of our business also are subject to rigorous regulation by other US federal and state regulatory agencies and by nonUS government agencies and regulatory bodies Activities The BHC Act generally limits bank holding companies to activities that are considered to be banking activities and certain closely related activities As noted above each of the Company and TRS is a bank holding company and each has elected to become a financial holding company which is authorized to engage in a broader range of financial and related activities In order to remain eligible for financial holding company status we must meet certain eligibility requirements Those requirements include that each of the Company and AENB must be well capitalized and well managed and AENB must have received at least a satisfactory rating on its most recent assessment under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 the CRA The Company and TRS engage in various activities permissible only for financial holding companies including in particular providing travel agency services acting as a finder and engaging in certain insurance underwriting and agency services If the Company fails to meet eligibility requirements for financial holding company status it and its subsidiaries are likely to be barred from engaging in new types of financial activities or making certain types of acquisitions or investments in reliance on its status as a financial holding company and ultimately could be required to either discontinue the broader range of activities permitted to financial holding companies or divest AENB In addition the Company and its subsidiaries are prohibited by law from engaging in practices that the relevant regulatory authority deems unsafe or unsound which such authorities generally interpret broadly 11 Table of Contents Acquisitions and Investments Applicable federal and state laws place limitations on the ability of persons to invest in or acquire control of us without providing notice to or obtaining the approval of one or more of our regulators In addition we are subject to banking laws and regulations that limit our investments and acquisitions and in some cases subject them to the prior review and approval of our regulators including the Federal Reserve and the OCC Federal banking regulators have broad discretion in evaluating proposed acquisitions and investments that are subject to their prior review or approval Financial Regulatory Reform In October 2019 the US federal bank regulatory agencies finalized rules that tailor the application of the enhanced prudential standards to bank holding companies and depository institutions the Tailoring Rules pursuant to the amendments to the DoddFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 Dodd Frank introduced by the Economic Growth Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act The Tailoring Rules assign each US bank holding company with 100 billion or more in total consolidated assets as well as its bank subsidiaries to one of four categories based on its status as a US global systemically important banking organization and five other riskbased indicators i size ii crossjurisdictional activity iii nonbank assets iv offbalance sheet exposure and v weighted shortterm wholesale funding Under the Tailoring Rules the Company and pursuant to the Tailoring Rules its depository institution subsidiary AENB is subject to Category IV standards Because a firms categorization under the Tailoring Rules is determined by and can change over time dependent upon how the firm measures against the riskbased indicator thresholds we are required to monitor and periodically report these riskbased indicators and there can be no assurance that the Company will continue to be a Category IV firm in the future Capital and Liquidity Regulation Capital Rules The Company and AENB are required to comply with the applicable capital adequacy rules established by federal banking regulators These rules are intended to ensure that bank holding companies and depository institutions collectively banking organizations have adequate capital given their level of assets and offbalance sheet obligations The federal banking regulators current capital rules the Capital Rules implement the Basel Committee on Banking Supervisions the Basel Committee framework for strengthening international capital regulation known as Basel III For additional information regarding our capital ratios see Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity under MDA Under the Capital Rules banking organizations are required to maintain minimum ratios for Common Equity Tier 1 CET1 Tier 1 capital that is CET1 plus additional Tier 1 capital and Total capital that is Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital to riskweighted assets We report our capital adequacy ratios using riskweighted assets calculated under the standardized approach As a Category IV firm we are not subject to the advanced approaches capital requirements In December 2017 the Basel Committee published standards that among other things revise the standardized approach for credit risk including by recalibrating risk weights and introducing additional capital requirements for certain unconditionally cancellable commitments such as unused credit card lines of credit and provide a new standardized calculation for operational risk capital requirements If adopted in the United States as issued by the Basel Committee and applicable to us the new standards could result in higher capital requirements for us In December 2018 federal banking regulators issued a final rule that provides an optional threeyear phasein period for the adverse regulatory capital effects of adopting the Current Expected Credit Loss CECL methodology pursuant to new accounting guidance for the recognition of credit losses on certain financial instruments which became effective January 1 2020 In August 2020 federal banking regulators issued a final rule that provides an option to delay the estimated impact of the adoption of the CECL methodology on regulatory capital for up to two years followed by the threeyear phasein period We elected to adopt the twoyear delay followed by the threeyear phasein period Therefore the Company will begin phasing in the cumulative amount that is not recognized in regulatory capital at 25 percent per year beginning January 1 2022 See Critical Accounting Estimates under MDA for additional information on CECL 12 Table of Contents The Company and AENB must each maintain CET1 Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios of at least 45 percent 60 percent and 80 percent respectively On top of these minimum capital ratios the Company is subject to a dynamic stress capital buffer SCB composed entirely of CET1 with a floor of 25 percent and AENB is subject to a static 25 percent capital conservation buffer CCB The SCB equals i the difference between a bank holding companys starting and minimum projected CET1 capital ratios under the supervisory severely adverse scenario under the Federal Reserves stress tests described below plus ii one year of planned common stock dividends as a percentage of riskweighted assets In August 2020 the SCB requirement for the Company was set at 25 percent A bank holding companys SCB requirement is generally effective on October 1 of each year and will remain in effect through September 30 of the following year unless it is reset in connection with resubmission of a capital plan as discussed below As a result the effective minimum ratios for the Company taking into account the SCB requirement and AENB taking into account the CCB requirement are 70 percent 85 percent and 105 percent for the CET1 Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios respectively Banking organizations whose ratios of CET1 Tier 1 Capital or Total capital to riskweighted assets are below these effective minimum ratios face constraints on discretionary distributions such as dividends repurchases and redemptions of capital securities and executive compensation The capital distribution restrictions for the first quarter of 2021 discussed under Stress Testing and Capital Planning below are in addition to the SCB distribution constraints for bank holding companies at least through March 31 2021 The Federal Reserve is expected to announce by March 31 2021 any recalibration of the SCB requirements announced in August 2020 We are also required to comply with minimum leverage ratio requirements The leverage ratio is the ratio of a banking organizations Tier 1 capital to its average total consolidated assets as defined for regulatory purposes All banking organizations are required to maintain a leverage ratio of at least 40 percent Liquidity Regulation The Federal Reserves enhanced prudential standards rule includes heightened liquidity and overall risk management requirements The rule requires the maintenance of a liquidity buffer consisting of highly liquid assets that is sufficient to meet projected net outflows for 30 days over a range of liquidity stress scenarios and a minimum liquidity coverage ratio LCR that measures a firms highquality liquid assets to its projected net outflows Under the Tailoring Rules Category IV firms with less than 50 billion in weighted shortterm wholesale funding such as the Company are not subject to any LCR requirement A second standard provided for in the Basel III liquidity framework referred to as the net stable funding ratio NSFR requires a minimum amount of longerterm funding based on the assets and activities of banking entities Under the final NSFR rule published in October 2020 Category IV firms with less than 50 billion in weighted shortterm wholesale funding such as the Company are not subject to any NSFR requirement Stress Testing and Capital Planning Under the Federal Reserves regulations the Company is subject to supervisory stress testing requirements that are designed to evaluate whether a bank holding company has sufficient capital on a total consolidated basis to absorb losses and support operations under adverse economic conditions As a Category IV firm the Company was subject to the Federal Reserves supervisory stress tests in 2020 and will be required to participate in the supervisory stress tests every other year thereafter We are required to develop and submit to the Federal Reserve an annual capital plan In January 2021 the Federal Reserve finalized changes to the capital plan rule which will among other things provide firms subject to Category IV standards additional flexibility to develop their capital plans In addition these changes provide that for Category IV firms such as the Company the portion of the SCB based on the Federal Reserves supervisory stress tests will be calculated every other year During a year in which a Category IV firm does not undergo a supervisory stress test the firm will receive an updated SCB that reflects the firms updated planned common stock dividends A Category IV firm will also be able to elect to participate in the supervisory stress test and consequently receive an updated SCB The Company must notify the Federal Reserve by April 5 2021 if it elects to participate in the 2021 supervisory stress test As part of the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review CCAR the Federal Reserve evaluates whether the Company has sufficient capital to continue operations by assessing our proforma capital position and ratios under a scenario of economic and financial market stress and uses that information to determine the size of the SCB for each CCAR participating firm 13 Table of Contents Due to the continued economic uncertainty from the coronavirus pandemic in June 2020 the Federal Reserve required all bank holding companies participating in CCAR to resubmit their capital plans in November 2020 In addition the Federal Reserve prohibited share repurchases in the third and fourth quarters of 2020 for all bank holding companies participating in CCAR and allowed them to pay common stock dividends provided a they did not increase the amount of the dividend and b the dividends did not exceed the average of a firms net income for the four preceding calendar quarters On December 18 2020 the Federal Reserve released the results of its second round of supervisory stress tests for all bank holding companies participating in CCAR based on economic scenarios reflecting changes in financial markets and the macroeconomic outlook The Federal Reserve announced that it would allow bank holding companies participating in CCAR to pay common stock dividends and repurchase common stock in the first quarter of 2021 provided a the dividends and repurchases in the aggregate do not exceed the average of a firms net income for the four preceding calendar quarters and b the firm does not increase the amount of its common stock dividends beyond the level paid in the second quarter of 2020 The Federal Reserve also announced that it would permit stock repurchases equal to the amount of share issuances related to expensed employee compensation For additional information regarding our capital distributions see Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity under MDA We may be required to revise and resubmit our capital plan following certain events or developments such as a significant acquisition or an event that could result in a material change in our risk profile or financial condition If we are required to resubmit our capital plan we must receive prior approval from the Federal Reserve for any capital distributions including common stock dividend payments and share repurchases other than a capital distribution on a newly issued capital instrument Dividends and Other Capital Distributions The Company and TRS as well as AENB and the Companys insurance and other regulated subsidiaries are limited in their ability to pay dividends by statutes regulations and supervisory policy Common stock dividend payments and share repurchases by the Company are subject to the oversight of the Federal Reserve as described above The Company will be subject to limitations and restrictions on capital distributions if among other things i the Companys regulatory capital ratios do not satisfy applicable minimum requirements and buffers or ii the Company is required to resubmit its capital plan In general federal laws and regulations prohibit without first obtaining the OCCs approval AENB from making dividend distributions to TRS if such distributions are not paid out of available recent earnings or would cause AENB to fail to meet capital adequacy standards In addition to specific limitations on the dividends AENB can pay to TRS federal banking regulators have authority to prohibit or limit the payment of a dividend if in the banking regulators opinion payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the institution Prompt Corrective Action The Federal Deposit Insurance Act FDIA requires among other things that federal banking regulators take prompt corrective action in respect of depository institutions insured by the FDIC such as AENB that do not meet minimum capital requirements The FDIA establishes five capital categories for FDICinsured banks well capitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized The FDIA imposes progressively more restrictive constraints on operations management and capital distributions depending on the capital category in which an institution is classified In order to be considered well capitalized AENB must maintain CET1 Tier 1 capital Total capital and Tier 1 leverage ratios of 65 percent 80 percent 100 percent and 50 percent respectively Under the FDIA AENB could be prohibited from accepting brokered deposits ie deposits raised through thirdparty brokerage networks or offering interest rates on any deposits significantly higher than the prevailing rate in its normal market area or nationally depending upon where the deposits are solicited unless 1 it is well capitalized or 2 it is adequately capitalized and receives a waiver from the FDIC A portion of our outstanding US retail deposits are considered brokered deposits for bank regulatory purposes If a federal regulator determines that we are in an unsafe or unsound condition or that we are engaging in unsafe or unsound banking practices the regulator may reclassify our capital category or otherwise place restrictions on our ability to accept or solicit brokered deposits On December 15 2020 the FDIC finalized a rule intended to update and modernize the FDICs brokered deposit regulations The final rule among other things expands the definition of deposit broker and updates the interest rate restrictions for less than well capitalized banks The final rule is expected to become effective on April 1 2021 14 Table of Contents Resolution Planning Pursuant to Dodd Frank certain bank holding companies are required to submit resolution plans to the Federal Reserve and FDIC providing for the companys strategy for rapid and orderly resolution in the event of its material financial distress or failure However in connection with the release of the Tailoring Rules the Federal Reserve and FDIC finalized rules in October 2019 which among other things adjust the review cycles and applicability of the agencies resolution planning requirements Under these rules Category IV firms such as the Company are not required to submit a holding company resolution plan AENB continues to be required to prepare and provide a separate resolution plan to the FDIC that would enable the FDIC as receiver to effectively resolve AENB under the FDIA in the event of failure The FDIC issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on potential revisions to this separate resolution plan requirement for insured depository institutions in April 2019 and temporarily suspended resolution planning requirements for insured depository institutions In January 2021 the FDIC lifted the moratorium on resolution plan submissions for insured depository institutions with 100 billion or more in assets including AENB and will provide at least 12months advance notice to firms required to submit resolution plans Orderly Liquidation Authority The Company could become subject to the Orderly Liquidation Authority OLA a resolution regime under which the Treasury Secretary may appoint the FDIC as receiver to liquidate a systemically important financial institution if the Company is in danger of default and is determined to present a systemic risk to US financial stability As under the FDIC resolution model under the OLA the FDIC has broad power as receiver Substantial differences exist however between the OLA and the FDIC resolution model for depository institutions including the right of the FDIC under the OLA to disregard the strict priority of creditor claims in limited circumstances the use of an administrative claims procedure to determine creditor claims as opposed to the judicial procedure used in bankruptcy proceedings and the right of the FDIC to transfer claims to a bridge entity The FDIC has developed a strategy under OLA referred to as the single point of entry or SPOE strategy under which the FDIC would resolve a failed financial holding company by transferring its assets including shares of its operating subsidiaries and potentially very limited liabilities to a bridge holding company utilize the resources of the failed financial holding company to recapitalize the operating subsidiaries and satisfy the claims of unsecured creditors of the failed financial holding company and other claimants in the receivership by delivering securities of one or more new financial companies that would emerge from the bridge holding company Under this strategy management of the failed financial holding company would be replaced and its shareholders and creditors would bear the losses resulting from the failure FDIC Powers upon Insolvency of AENB If the FDIC is appointed the conservator or receiver of AENB the FDIC has the power 1 to transfer any of AENBs assets and liabilities to a new obligor without the approval of AENBs creditors 2 to enforce the terms of AENBs contracts pursuant to their terms or 3 to repudiate or disaffirm any contract or lease to which AENB is a party the performance of which is determined by the FDIC to be burdensome and the disaffirmation or repudiation of which is determined by the FDIC to promote the orderly administration of AENB In addition the claims of holders of US deposit liabilities and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC against AENB would be afforded priority over other general unsecured claims against AENB including claims of debt holders and depositors in nonUS offices in the liquidation or other resolution of AENB As a result whether or not the FDIC ever sought to repudiate any debt obligations of AENB the debt holders and depositors in nonUS offices would be treated differently from and could receive substantially less if anything than the depositors in the US offices of AENB 15 Table of Contents Other Banking Regulations Source of Strength The Company is required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to its US bank subsidiary AENB and may be required to commit capital and financial resources to support AENB Such support may be required at times when absent this requirement the Company otherwise might determine not to provide it Capital loans by the Company to AENB are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of AENB In the event of the Companys bankruptcy any commitment by the Company to a federal banking regulator to maintain the capital of AENB will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment Transactions Between AENB and its Affiliates Certain transactions including loans and credit extensions from AENB between AENB and its affiliates including the Company TRS and their other subsidiaries are subject to quantitative and qualitative limitations collateral requirements and other restrictions imposed by statute and regulation Transactions subject to these restrictions are generally required to be made on an armslength basis FDIC Deposit Insurance and Insurance Assessments AENB accepts deposits that are insured by the FDIC up to the applicable limits Under the FDIA the FDIC may terminate the insurance of an institutions deposits upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law regulation rule order or condition imposed by the FDIC We do not know of any practice condition or violation that would lead to termination of deposit insurance at AENB The FDICs deposit insurance fund is funded by assessments on insured depository institutions including AENB which are subject to adjustment by the FDIC Community Reinvestment Act AENB is subject to the CRA which imposes affirmative ongoing obligations on depository institutions to meet the credit needs of their local communities including low and moderateincome neighborhoods consistent with the safe and sound operation of the institution In May 2020 the OCC issued a final rule intended to i clarify which activities qualify for CRA credit ii update where activities count for CRA credit and iii change the methods for CRA measurement data collection recordkeeping and reporting for national banks and federal savings associations The final rule retains the current community development test for limited purpose banks such as AENB which evaluates a banks community development performance through its community development loans investments and services The final rule requires institutions like AENB to designate additional geographic assessment areas where CRA activities will be measured for significant concentrations of retail domestic deposits AENB must comply with the final rule by January 1 2023 Consumer Financial Products Regulation In the United States our marketing sale and servicing of consumer financial products and our compliance with certain federal consumer financial laws are supervised and examined by the CFPB which has broad rulemaking and enforcement authority over providers of credit savings and payment services and products and authority to prevent unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices In addition a number of US states have significant consumer credit protection disclosure and other laws in certain cases more stringent than US federal laws US federal law also regulates abusive debt collection practices which along with bankruptcy and debtor relief laws can affect our ability to collect amounts owed to us or subject us to regulatory scrutiny On October 30 2020 the CFPB issued a final rule that sets forth additional requirements for thirdparty debt collection agencies which we use in the ordinary course of business See  We are exposed to credit risk and trends that affect Card Member spending and the ability of customers and partners to pay us which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition  under Risk Factors for potential impacts related to legal and regulatory changes on our ability to collect amounts owed to us We are also regulated in the United States under the money transmitter or sale of check laws in effect in most states In addition we are required by the laws of many states to comply with unclaimed and abandoned property laws under which we must pay to states the face amount of any Travelers Cheque or prepaid card that is uncashed or unredeemed after a period of time depending on the type of product 16 Table of Contents In countries outside the United States regulators continue to focus on a number of key areas impacting our cardissuing businesses particularly consumer protection such as in the European Union EU the United Kingdom and Canada and responsible lending such as in Australia Mexico New Zealand and Singapore with increasing importance on and attention to customers and outcomes rather than just ensuring compliance with local rules and regulations Regulators expectations of firms in relation to their compliance risk and control frameworks continue to increase and regulators are placing significant emphasis on a firms systems and controls relating to the identification and resolution of issues Payments Regulation Legislators and regulators in various countries in which we operate have focused on the operation of card networks including through enforcement actions legislation and regulations to change certain practices or pricing of card issuers merchant acquirers and payment networks and in some cases to establish broad and ongoing regulatory oversight regimes for payment systems The EU Australia and other jurisdictions have focused on interchange fees that is the fee paid by the bankcard merchant acquirer to the card issuer in payment networks like Visa and Mastercard as well as the rules contract terms and practices governing merchant card acceptance Regulation and other governmental actions relating to pricing or practices could affect all networks directly or indirectly as well as adversely impact consumers and merchants Among other things regulation of bankcard fees has negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact the discount revenue we earn including as a result of downward pressure on our discount rate from decreases in competitor pricing in connection with caps on interchange fees In some cases regulations also extend to certain aspects of our business such as network and cobrand arrangements or the terms of card acceptance for merchants and we have exited our network businesses in the EU and Australia as a result of regulation in those jurisdictions for example In addition there is uncertainty as to when or how interchange fee caps and other provisions of the EU payments legislation might apply when we work with cobrand partners and agents in the EU Given differing interpretations by regulators and participants in cobrand arrangements we are subject to regulatory action penalties and the possibility we will not be able to maintain our existing cobrand and agent relationships in the EU In various countries such as certain Member States in the EU and Australia merchants are permitted by law to surcharge card purchases In addition the laws of a number of states in the United States that prohibit surcharging have been challenged in litigation brought by merchant groups and some such laws have been overturned Surcharging is an adverse customer experience and could have a material adverse effect on us if it becomes widespread particularly where it only or disproportionately impacts credit card usage our Card Members or our business In addition other steering or differential acceptance practices that are permitted by regulation in some countries could also have a material adverse effect on us if they become widespread See  Surcharging or steering by merchants could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations  under Risk Factors In some countries governments have established regulatory regimes that require international card networks to be locally licensed andor to localize aspects of their operations For example the Reserve Bank of India which has broad power under the Payment and Settlement Systems Act 2007 to regulate the membership and operations of card networks has issued a mandate requiring payment systems operators in India to store certain payments data locally Governments in some countries also provide resources or protection to select domestic payment card networks The development and enforcement of these and other similar laws regulations and policies may adversely affect our ability to compete effectively and maintain and extend our global network Privacy Data Protection Data Governance Information and Cyber Security Regulatory and legislative activity in the areas of privacy data protection data governance and information and cyber security continues to increase worldwide We have established and continue to maintain policies and a governance framework to comply with applicable privacy data protection data governance and information and cyber security laws and requirements meet evolving customer and industry expectations and support and enable business innovation and growth Our regulators are increasingly focused on ensuring that our privacy data protection data governance and information and cyber securityrelated policies and practices are adequate to inform customers of our data collection use sharing andor security practices to provide them with choices if required about how we use and share their information and to appropriately safeguard their personal information and account access Regulators are also focused on data management data governance and our thirdparty risk management policies and practices 17 Table of Contents In the United States certain of our businesses are subject to the privacy disclosure and safeguarding provisions of the GrammLeachBliley Act GLBA and its implementing regulations and guidance Among other things GLBA imposes certain limitations on our ability to share consumers nonpublic personal information with nonaffiliated third parties and requires us to develop implement and maintain a written comprehensive information security program containing safeguards that are appropriate to the size and complexity of our business the nature and scope of our activities and the sensitivity of customer information that we process We are required to offer expanded privacy rights to California residents who are not covered by GLBA pursuant to the California Consumer Privacy Act Various regulators US states and territories are considering similar requirements or have adopted laws rules and regulations pertaining to privacy andor information and cyber security that may be more stringent andor expansive than federal requirements We are also subject to certain privacy data protection data governance and information and cyber security laws in other countries in which we operate including countries in the EU Australia Canada China Japan Hong Kong India Mexico Singapore and the United Kingdom some of which are more stringent andor expansive than those in the United States Some countries have also instituted laws requiring incountry data processing andor incountry storage of data Compliance with such laws could result in higher technology administrative and other costs for us could limit our ability to optimize the use of our closedloop data and could require use of local technology services Certain laws also require us to provide foreign governments and other third parties broader access to our data and intellectual property Data breach and operational outage notification laws or regulatory activities to encourage such notifications are also becoming more prevalent in jurisdictions outside the United States in which we operate In Europe the EU General Data Protection Regulation GDPR imposes legal and compliance obligations on companies that process personal data of individuals in the EU irrespective of the geographical location of the company with significant fines for noncompliance up to 4 percent of total annual worldwide revenue We continue to rely on our binding corporate rules as the primary method for lawfully transferring data from our European affiliates to our affiliates in the United States and elsewhere globally The GDPR includes among other things a requirement for prompt notice of data breaches in certain circumstances to affected individuals and supervisory authorities The GDPR was transposed into UK domestic law in January 2021 following the United Kingdoms exit from the EU This is known as the UK GDPR and it supplements the United Kingdoms Data Protection Act of 2018 The UK GDPR mirrors the compliance requirements and fine structure of the GDPR In addition the European Directive 200258EC the ePrivacy Directive will continue to set out requirements for the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector until the approval of the forthcoming ePrivacy Regulation The ePrivacy Directive places restrictions on among other things the sending of unsolicited marketing communications as well as on the collection and use of data about internet users The European Central Bank and the European Banking Authority have enacted or are considering secondary legislation focused on security breaches outsourcing resiliency strong customer authentication and information securityrelated policies Likewise a network and information security directive has been implemented into national laws by Member States in the EU The Revised Payment Services Directive PSD2 also contains regulatory requirements on strong customer authentication open access to customer data and payment capabilities and measures to prevent security incidents 18 Table of Contents AntiMoney Laundering Sanctions and AntiCorruption Compliance We are subject to significant supervision and regulation and an increasingly stringent enforcement environment with respect to compliance with antimoney laundering AML sanctions and anticorruption laws and regulations in the United States and in other jurisdictions in which we operate Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs and policies and procedures for AML sanctions and anticorruption compliance could have material financial legal and reputational consequences AntiMoney Laundering American Express is subject to a significant number of AML laws and regulations as a result of being a financial company headquartered in the United States as well as having a global presence In the United States the majority of AML requirements are derived from the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act and the accompanying regulations issued by the US Department of the Treasury collectively referred to as the Bank Secrecy Act as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 the Patriot Act The AntiMoney Laundering Act of 2020 the AMLA enacted in January 2021 amended the Bank Secrecy Act and is intended to comprehensively reform and modernize US AML laws Many of the statutory provisions in the AMLA will require additional rulemakings reports and other measures the effects of which are not known at this time In Europe AML requirements are largely the result of countries transposing the 5th and 6th EU AntiMoney Laundering Directives and preceding EU AntiMoney Laundering Directives into local laws and regulations Numerous other countries such as Argentina Australia Canada India Mexico New Zealand and Russia have also enacted or proposed new or enhanced AML legislation and regulations applicable to American Express Among other things these laws and regulations require us to establish AML programs that meet certain standards including in some instances expanded reporting particularly in the area of suspicious transactions and enhanced information gathering and recordkeeping requirements Our AML programs have become the subject of heightened scrutiny in some countries Any errors failures or delays in complying with federal state or foreign AML and counterterrorist financing laws or perceived deficiencies in our AML programs could result in significant criminal and civil lawsuits penalties and forfeiture of significant assets or other enforcement actions 19 Table of Contents Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation The United States has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries nationals and others The United States prohibits US persons from engaging with individuals and entities identified as Specially Designated Nationals such as terrorists and narcotics traffickers These prohibitions are administered by the US Department of the Treasurys Office of Foreign Assets Control OFAC and are typically known as the OFAC rules The OFAC rules prohibit US persons from engaging in financial transactions with or relating to the prohibited individual entity or country require the blocking of assets in which the individual entity or country has an interest and prohibit transfers of property subject to US jurisdiction including property in the possession or control of US persons to such individual entity or country Blocked assets eg property or bank deposits cannot be paid out withdrawn set off or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC We maintain a global sanctions program designed to ensure compliance with OFAC requirements Failure to comply with such requirements could subject us to serious legal and reputational consequences including criminal penalties Pursuant to Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 which added Section 13r to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended the Exchange Act an issuer is required to disclose in its annual or quarterly reports as applicable whether it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities transactions or dealings relating to Iran or with individuals or entities designated pursuant to certain Executive Orders Disclosure is generally required even where the activities transactions or dealings were conducted outside the United States by nonUS affiliates in compliance with applicable law and whether or not the activities are sanctionable under US law In 2020 we became aware of credit card accounts opened with American Express International Inc Hong Kong branch by the Acting Consul General of the Iranian Consulate in Hong Kong and his predecessor the nowformer Consul General We believe these cards were used only for personal expenses The Acting Consul General had two cards both of which were opened in 2018 and one of which was closed by client request on or about April 3 2019 and the other of which was cancelled by us on or about June 16 2020 The former Consul Generals card was issued in January 2019 and cancelled by us on or about March 13 2019 We had negligible gross revenues and net profits attributable to these accounts As all of the accounts were cancelled we do not intend to continue to engage in this activity 20 Table of Contents AntiCorruption We are subject to complex international and US anticorruption laws and regulations including the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act the FCPA the UK Bribery Act and other laws that prohibit the making or offering of improper payments The FCPA makes it illegal to corruptly offer or provide anything of value to foreign government officials political parties or political party officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or an improper advantage The FCPA also requires us to strictly comply with certain accounting and internal controls standards The UK Bribery Act also prohibits commercial bribery and the receipt of a bribe and makes it a corporate offense to fail to prevent bribery by an associated person in addition to prohibiting improper payments to foreign government officials Failure of the Company our subsidiaries colleagues contractors or agents to comply with the FCPA the UK Bribery Act and other similar laws can expose us andor individual colleagues to investigation prosecution and potentially severe criminal and civil penalties Compensation Practices Our compensation practices are subject to oversight by the Federal Reserve The federal banking regulators guidance on sound incentive compensation practices sets forth three key principles for incentive compensation arrangements that are designed to help ensure that incentive compensation plans do not encourage imprudent risktaking and are consistent with the safety and soundness of banking organizations The three principles provide that a banking organizations incentive compensation arrangements should 1 provide incentives that appropriately balance risk and financial results in a manner that does not encourage employees to expose their organizations to imprudent risks 2 be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management and 3 be supported by strong corporate governance including active and effective oversight by the organizations board of directors Any deficiencies in our compensation practices that are identified by the Federal Reserve or other banking regulators in connection with their review of our compensation practices may be incorporated into our supervisory ratings which can affect our ability to make acquisitions or perform other actions Enforcement actions may be taken against us if our incentive compensation arrangements or related riskmanagement control or governance processes are determined to pose a risk to our safety and soundness and we have not taken prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies In May 2016 the federal banking regulators the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC the Federal Housing Finance Agency and the National Credit Union Administration reproposed a rule originally proposed in 2011 on incentivebased compensation practices The reproposed rule would apply deferral downward adjustment and forfeiture and clawback requirements to incentivebased compensation arrangements granted to senior executive officers and significant risktakers of covered institutions with specific requirements varying based on the asset size of the covered institution and the category of employee If these or other regulations are adopted in a form similar to what has been proposed they will impose limitations on the manner in which we may structure compensation for our colleagues which could adversely affect our ability to hire retain and motivate key colleagues 21 Table of Contents ADDITIONAL INFORMATION We maintain an Investor Relations website at httpiramericanexpresscom We make available free of charge on or through this website our annual quarterly and current reports and any amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable following the time they are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC In addition we routinely post financial and other information some of which could be material to investors on our Investor Relations website Information regarding our corporate responsibility and sustainability initiatives including our Environmental Social and Governance reports are available on our Corporate Responsibility website at httpaboutamericanexpresscomcorporateresponsibility The content of any of our websites referred to in this report is not incorporated by reference into this report or any other report filed with or furnished to the SEC We have included such website addresses only as inactive textual references and do not intend them to be active links You can find certain statistical disclosures required of bank holding companies starting on page A1 which are incorporated herein by reference Our business as a whole has not experienced significant seasonal fluctuations although card billed business tends to be moderately higher in the fourth quarter than in other quarters As a result the amount of Card Member loans and receivables outstanding tend to be moderately higher during that quarter The average discount rate also tends to be slightly lower during the fourth quarter due to a higher level of retailrelated billed business volumes 22 Table of Contents ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS This section highlights certain risks that could affect us and our businesses broadly categorized as Strategic Business and Competitive Risks Legal Regulatory and Compliance Risks and Credit Liquidity and Market Risks You should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10K including the Risk Management section under MDA which describes our approach to identifying monitoring and managing the risks we assume in conducting our businesses and provides certain quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks The risks and uncertainties we face are not limited to those described below Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business Strategic Business and Competitive Risks The impact of the COVID19 pandemic and the measures implemented to contain the spread of the virus have had and are expected to continue to have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations The COVID19 pandemic is having widespread rapidly evolving and unpredictable impacts on global society economies financial markets and business practices The pandemic and containment measures have contributed to among other things  Widespread changes to and significant reductions in household and business activity and consumer and business spending as well as economic concerns and a rise in unemployment  Adverse impacts on our cobrand and other partners in the travel and airline industries our GBT JV and on our thirdparty service providers merchants customer acquisition channels processors aggregators network partners and other third parties that we rely on for services that are integral to our operations  Adverse impacts on the creditworthiness of our customers and other counterparties and their ability to pay amounts owed to us and our ability to collect such amounts and required increases in our reserves for credit losses  Adverse impacts on industries representing a significant portion of our billed business including but not limited to travel and entertainment TE spending  Adverse impacts on capital and credit market conditions and our deposit base which may limit our access to funding increase our cost of capital and affect our ability to meet liquidity needs  An increased risk of significantly higher Card Member reimbursements for goods or services purchased from merchants that cease operations or are otherwise unable to ultimately provide those goods or services or in the case of our business partners impairments of rewards points we purchased from those partners  An increased strain on our risk management policies generally including but not limited to the effectiveness and accuracy of our models given the lack of data inputs and comparable precedent  An increased risk of impairment restructuring or other charges including as a result of impairment of the value of our investments and other assets  Adverse impacts on our daily business operations and our colleagues ability to perform necessary business functions including as a result of illness office closures and other limitations or restrictions on movement  Increased challenges in growing or retaining our Card Member base and in launching new products or businesses or refreshing existing products in line with expectations or the current and changing needs of our customers  Increased spending on our business continuity efforts such as technology service centers and our supply chain and readiness efforts for returning to our offices which may in turn require that we further cut costs and investments in other areas  An increased risk of an information or cyber security incident fraud a failure to maintain the uninterrupted operation of our information systems or a failure in the effectiveness of our AML and other compliance programs due to among other things an increase in remote work These and other impacts of the COVID19 pandemic may continue even after the outbreak has subsided and containment measures are lifted and may exacerbate many of the other risks described in this Risk Factors section The extent to which our business and results of operations will continue to be adversely affected will depend on numerous evolving factors and future developments that we are not able to predict including the continued spread and severity of the virus and new variants the imposition of further containment measures and their ability to control the spread of the virus the availability distribution and use of effective treatments and vaccines the extent and duration of the effect on the economy unemployment consumer confidence and consumer and business spending the availability and effectiveness of government stimulus measures and how quickly and to what extent normal operating conditions and customer behaviors resume such as with respect to travel dining and inperson events Difficult conditions in the business and economic environment including as a result of the COVID19 pandemic have had and are expected to continue to have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations We offer a broad array of products and services to consumers small businesses and commercial clients and thus are very dependent upon the level of consumer and business activity and the demand for payment and financing products Slow 23 Table of Contents economic growth economic contraction or shifts in broader consumer and business trends significantly impact customer behaviors including spending on our cards the ability and willingness of Card Members to borrow and pay amounts owed to us and demand for feebased products and services Factors such as consumer spending and confidence unemployment rates business investment geopolitical instability public policy decisions government spending international trade relationships interest rates taxes energy costs the volatility and strength of the capital markets inflation and deflation all affect the economic environment and ultimately our profitability Such factors may also cause our earnings billings loan balances credit metrics and margins to fluctuate and diverge from expectations of analysts and investors who may have differing assumptions regarding their impact on our business adversely affecting andor increasing the volatility of the trading price of our common shares Spending at TE merchants for example is sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending levels and circumstances impacting travel We experienced the effects of this sensitivity in 2020 as a result of the COVID19 pandemic with TE spending decreasing 61 percent compared to 2019 while nonTE spending decreased 1 percent Likewise spending by small businesses and corporate clients which comprised approximately 40 percent of our worldwide billed business during 2020 depends in part on the economic environment and a favorable climate for continued business investment and new business formation as well as on related volumes of business travel During the pandemic Card Member billed business decreased 19 percent in 2020 compared to 2019 Increases in delinquencies and writeoff rates as a result of increases in bankruptcies unemployment rates changes in customer behaviors or otherwise could also have a material adverse effect on our results of operations We increased our reserves for credit losses significantly in 2020 due to the deterioration of the global macroeconomic outlook The consequences of negative circumstances impacting us or the environment generally can be sudden and severe as we experienced from the end of the first quarter into the second quarter of 2020 due to the pandemic Our business is subject to the effects of geopolitical events weather natural disasters other catastrophic events and other conditions Geopolitical events terrorist attacks natural disasters severe weather conditions health pandemics information or cyber security incidents including intrusion into or degradation of systems or technology by cyberattacks and other catastrophic events can have a material adverse effect on our business Political and social conditions fiscal and monetary policies trade wars and tariffs prolonged or recurring government shutdowns regional or domestic hostilities and the prospect or occurrence of more widespread conflicts could also negatively affect consumer and business spending including travel patterns and business investment and demand for credit As noted above the COVID19 pandemic has had and is expected to continue to have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations Because of our proximity to the World Trade Center site our headquarters were damaged as a result of the terrorist attacks of September 11 2001 Recent hurricanes and other natural disasters have impacted spending and credit performance in the areas affected Other disasters or catastrophic events in the future and the impact of such events on certain industries or the overall economy could have a negative effect on our business results of operations and infrastructure including our technology and systems Climate change may exacerbate certain of these threats including the frequency and severity of weatherrelated events Card Members in California New York Florida Texas Georgia and New Jersey account for a significant portion of US Consumer billed business and Card Members loans and our results of operations could be impacted by events or conditions that disproportionately or specifically affect one or more of those states Because we derive a portion of our revenues from travelrelated spending our business is sensitive to safety concerns related to travel and tourism limitations on travel and mobility and healthrelated risks including travel restrictions and bans as a result of the COVID19 pandemic and changes in customer behaviors that may continue even after the outbreak has subsided and containment measures are lifted such as decisions to delay or forgo business or personal travel In addition disruptions in air travel and other forms of travel can result in the payment of claims under travel interruption insurance policies we offer The exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union could materially adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition Our business in the United Kingdom and elsewhere may be negatively impacted by the exit of the United Kingdom from the EU commonly referred to as Brexit including from a deterioration of the economic environment in the United Kingdom and other countries in which we operate While a trade deal was agreed to between the United Kingdom and the EU at the end of 2020 the financial trade and legal implications of Brexit remain uncertain As of December 31 2020 the United Kingdom constituted approximately 4 percent of our worldwide billed business and the EMEA Europe Middle East and Africa region as a whole constituted approximately 9 percent Our operating results may materially suffer because of substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the payments industry 24 Table of Contents The payments industry is highly competitive and we compete with card networks issuers and acquirers paperbased transactions eg cash and checks bank transfer models eg wire transfers and ACH as well as evolving and growing alternative payment and financing providers If we are not able to differentiate ourselves from our competitors develop compelling value propositions for our customers andor effectively grow in areas such as mobile and online payments and emerging technologies we may not be able to compete effectively We believe Visa and Mastercard are larger than we are in most countries based on billed business volumes As a result card issuers and acquirers on the Visa and Mastercard networks may be able to benefit from the dominant position scale resources marketing and pricing of those networks Our business may also be negatively affected if we are unable to continue increasing merchant acceptance including by merchants that accept cards on the Visa and Mastercard networks and perceptions of coverage or if our Card Members do not experience welcome acceptance of our cards Some of our competitors have developed or may develop substantially greater financial and other resources than we have and may offer richer value propositions or a wider range of programs and services than we offer or may use more effective advertising marketing or crossselling strategies to acquire and retain more customers capture a greater share of spending and borrowings establish and develop more attractive cobrand card and other partner programs and maintain greater merchant acceptance than we have We may not be able to compete effectively against these threats or respond or adapt to changes in consumer spending habits as effectively as our competitors Costs such as Card Member rewards and Card Member services expenses could continue to increase as we improve our value propositions for Card Members including in response to increased competition Spending on our cards could continue to be impacted by increasing consumer usage of credit and debit cards issued on other networks as well as adoption of alternative payment mechanisms systems and products The fragmentation of customer spending to take advantage of different merchant or card incentives or for convenience with technological solutions may continue to increase Revolving credit balances on our cards could also be impacted by alternative financing providers such as pointofsale lenders To the extent other payment and financing mechanisms systems and products continue to successfully expand our discount revenues earned from Card Member spending and our net interest income earned from Card Member borrowing could be negatively impacted In addition companies that control access to consumer and merchant payment method choices at the point of sale or through digital wallets commercerelated experiences mobile applications or other technologies could choose not to accept suppress use of or degrade the experience of using our products or could restrict our access to our customers and transaction data Such companies could also require payments from us to participate in such digital wallets experiences or applications or negotiate incentives or pricing concessions impacting our profitability on transactions The competitive value of our closedloop data may also be diminished as traditional and nontraditional competitors use other new data sources and technologies to derive similar insights Certain regulations such as PSD2 in Europe and open banking initiatives in various jurisdictions around the world could also diminish the value of our closedloop data or the demand for our products and services by disintermediating existing financial services providers To the extent we expand into new business areas and new geographic regions such as mainland China we will face competitors with more experience and more established relationships with relevant customers regulators and industry participants which could adversely affect our ability to compete Laws and business practices that favor local competitors require card transactions to be routed over domestic networks or prohibit or limit foreign ownership of certain businesses could limit our growth in international regions We may face additional compliance and regulatory risks to the extent that we expand into new business areas and we may need to dedicate more expense time and resources to comply with regulatory requirements than our competitors particularly those that are not regulated financial institutions Many of our competitors are subject to different and in some cases less stringent legislative and regulatory regimes and some may have lower cost structures and more agile business models and systems More restrictive laws and regulations that do not apply to all of our competitors can put us at a disadvantage including prohibiting us from engaging in certain transactions regulating our business practices or adversely affecting our cost structure We face intense competition for partner relationships which could result in a loss or renegotiation of these arrangements that could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations In the ordinary course of our business we enter into different types of contractual arrangements with business partners in a variety of industries For example we have partnered with Delta Marriott Hilton and British Airways as well as many others globally to offer cobranded cards for consumers and small businesses and through our Membership Rewards program we have partnered with businesses in many industries including Delta and others in the airline industry to offer benefits to Card Member participants See Partners and Relationships under Business for additional information on our business partnerships including with Delta Competition for relationships with key business partners is very intense and there can be no assurance we will be able to grow or maintain these partner relationships or that they will remain as profitable Establishing and retaining attractive cobrand card partnerships is particularly competitive among card issuers and networks as these partnerships typically appeal to highspending 25 Table of Contents loyal customers All of our cobrand portfolios in the aggregate accounted for approximately 19 percent of our worldwide billed business for the year ended December 31 2020 Card Member loans related to our cobrand portfolios accounted for approximately 37 percent of our worldwide Card Member loans as of December 31 2020 Cobrand arrangements are entered into for a fixed period generally ranging from five to ten years and will terminate in accordance with their terms including at the end of the fixed period unless extended or renewed at the option of the parties or upon early termination as a result of an event of default or otherwise We face the risk that we could lose partner relationships even after we have invested significant resources in the relationships We may also choose to not renew certain cobrand relationships The volume of billed business could decline and Card Member attrition could increase in each case significantly as a result of the termination of one or more cobrand partnership relationships In addition some of our cobrand arrangements provide that upon expiration or termination the cobrand partner may purchase or designate a third party to purchase the loans generated with respect to its program which could result in the loss of the card accounts and a significant decline in our Card Member loans outstanding We regularly seek to extend or renew cobrand arrangements in advance of the end of the contract term and face the risk that existing relationships will be renegotiated with less favorable terms for us or that we may be unable to renegotiate on terms that are acceptable to us as competition for such relationships continues to increase We make payments to our cobrand partners which can be significant based primarily on the amount of Card Member spending and corresponding rewards earned on such spending and under certain arrangements on the number of accounts acquired and retained The amount we pay to our cobrand partners has increased particularly in the United States and may continue to increase as arrangements are renegotiated due to increasingly intense competition for cobrand partners among card issuers and networks See OffBalance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations under MDA for additional information regarding commitments for payments to certain cobrand partners The loss of exclusivity arrangements with business partners the loss of the partner relationship altogether whether by nonrenewal at the end of the contract period such as the end of our relationship with Costco in the United States in 2016 or as the result of a merger legal or regulatory action or otherwise such as the withdrawal of American Airlines in 2014 from our Airport Club Access program for Centurion  and Platinum Card  Members or the renegotiation of existing partnerships with terms that are significantly worse for us could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations See Our business is subject to comprehensive government regulation and supervision which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition for information on the uncertainty regarding our cobrand and agent relationships in the EU In addition any publicity associated with the loss of any of our key business partners could harm our reputation making it more difficult to attract and retain Card Members and merchants and could weaken our negotiating position with our remaining and prospective business partners Arrangements with our business partners represent a significant portion of our business We are exposed to risks associated with our business partners including reputational issues business slowdowns bankruptcies liquidations restructurings and consolidations and the possible obligation to make payments to our partners Our success is in many ways dependent on the success of our partners From customer acquisition to cobranding arrangements from participation in our rewards programs to facilitating B2B supplier payments for our corporate clients we rely on our business partners across many aspects of our company and our arrangements with business partners represent a significant portion of our business Some of our partners manage certain aspects of our customer relationships such as our OptBlue partners To the extent any of our partners fail to effectively promote and support our products experience a slowdown in their business operational disruptions reputational issues or loss of consumer confidence or are otherwise unable to meet our expectations or those of their other stakeholders our business may be materially negatively impacted We face the risk that existing relationships will be renegotiated with less favorable terms for us or that we may be unable to renegotiate on terms that are acceptable to us In addition we may be obligated to make or accelerate payments to certain business partners such as cobrand partners upon the occurrence of certain triggering events such as a shortfall in certain performance and revenue levels If we are not able to effectively manage these triggering events we could unexpectedly have to make payments to these partners which could have a negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations See Contractual Obligations under MDA for additional information on financial commitments related to agreements with certain cobrand partners Similarly we are exposed to risk from bankruptcies liquidations insolvencies financial distress restructurings consolidations and other similar events that may occur in any industry representing a significant portion of our billed business which could negatively impact particular card products and services and billed business generally and our financial condition and results of operations During 2020 we prepurchased loyalty points from certain of our travel cobrand partners which we may use for future promotions rewards and incentive programs for our customers To the extent such partners cease operations or the loyalty points are no longer desired by our customers the value of the prepurchased points may be diminished and may result in an impairment charge We could also be materially impacted if we were obligated or elected to reimburse Card Members for products and services purchased from merchants that have ceased operations or stopped accepting our cards For example we are exposed to credit risk in the airline industry to the extent we protect Card Members against nondelivery of goods and 26 Table of Contents services such as where we have remitted payment to an airline for a Card Member purchase of tickets that have not yet been used or flown If we are unable to collect the amount from the airline we may bear the loss for the amount credited to the Card Member At December 31 2020 our best estimate of the maximum amount of billed business volumes for goods and services that had yet to be delivered by or could be charged back to merchants was 19 billion This amount assumes all such merchants worldwide cease operations and thus are no longer available to deliver such goods and services or to accept such chargebacks and that all such billed business results in claimsinfull by Card Members Such a maximum amount has not been indicative of our actual loss exposure in the past and we have not experienced significant losses related to these exposures to date however our historical experience may not be representative in the current environment given the economic and financial disruptions particularly to travel caused by the COVID19 pandemic and resulting containment measures See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding this exposure For additional information relating to the general risks related to the airline industry see Risk ManagementInstitutional Credit RiskExposure to the Airline and Travel Industry under MDA We face continued intense competitive pressure that may materially impact the prices we charge for accepting our cards for payment for goods and services as well as the risk of losing merchant relationships which could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations We face pressure from competitors that primarily rely on sources of revenue other than discount revenue or have lower costs that can make their pricing for card acceptance more attractive Merchants business partners and thirdparty merchant acquirers and aggregators are also able to negotiate incentives pricing concessions and other contractual benefits from us as a condition to accepting our cards being cobrand partners or signing merchants on our behalf As merchants become even larger such as the largest tech companies we may have to increase the amount of incentives andor concessions we provide to such merchants We also face the risk of losing a merchant relationship that could materially adversely affect our billed business volumes ability to retain current Card Members and attract new Card Members and therefore our business and results of operations Our average merchant discount rate has been impacted by regulatory changes affecting competitor pricing in certain international countries We have also experienced erosion of our average merchant discount rate as we increase merchant acceptance We may not be successful in significantly expanding merchant acceptance or offsetting rate erosion with volumes at new merchants In addition the regulatory environment and differentiated payment models and technologies from nontraditional players in the alternative payments space could pose challenges to our traditional payment model and adversely impact our average merchant discount rate Some merchants continue to invest in their own payment solutions such as proprietarybranded mobile wallets using both traditional and new technology platforms If merchants are able to drive broad consumer adoption and usage it could adversely impact our average merchant discount rate and billed business volumes A continuing priority of ours is to drive greater and differentiated value to our merchants that if not successful could negatively impact our discount revenue and financial results We may not succeed in maintaining merchant discount rates or offsetting the impact of declining merchant discount rates for the reasons discussed above and others which could materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability and therefore our ability to invest in innovation and in valueadded services for merchants and Card Members Surcharging or steering by merchants could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations In certain countries such as Australia and certain Member States in the EU merchants are expressly permitted by law to surcharge certain card purchases In jurisdictions allowing surcharging we have seen merchant surcharging on American Express cards in certain merchant categories and in some cases either the surcharge is greater than that applied to Visa and Mastercard cards or Visa and Mastercard cards are not surcharged at all practices that are known as differential surcharging even though there are many cards issued on competing networks that have an equal or greater cost of acceptance for the merchant In addition the laws of a number of states in the United States that prohibit surcharging have been overturned in litigation brought by merchant groups We also encounter merchants that accept our cards but tell their customers that they prefer to accept another type of payment or otherwise seek to suppress use of our cards Our Card Members value the ability to use their cards where and when they want to and we therefore take steps to meet our Card Members expectations and to protect the American Express brand by prohibiting this form of discrimination subject to local legal requirements When we work with merchant acquirers aggregators and processors to manage certain aspects of the merchant relationship we are dependent on them to promote and support the acceptance and usage of our cards but such third parties may have business interests strategies or goals that are inconsistent with ours If surcharging steering or other forms of discrimination become widespread American Express cards and credit and charge cards generally could become less desirable to consumers which could result in a decrease in cardsinforce and transaction 27 Table of Contents volumes The impact could vary depending on such factors as the industry or manner in which a surcharge is levied how Card Members are surcharged or steered to other card products or payment forms at the point of sale the ease and speed of implementation for merchants including as a result of new or emerging technologies the size and recurrence of the underlying charges and whether and to what extent these actions are applied to other forms of payment including whether it varies depending on the type of card eg credit or debit product network acquirer or issuer Discrimination against American Express cards could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations particularly where it only or disproportionately impacts credit card usage our Card Members or our business We may not be successful in our efforts to promote card usage through marketing and promotion merchant acceptance and Card Member rewards and services or to effectively control the costs of such investments both of which may materially impact our profitability Revenue growth is dependent on increasing consumer and business spending on our cards growing loan balances and increasing fee revenue We have been investing in a number of growth initiatives including to attract new Card Members reduce Card Member attrition and capture a greater share of customers total spending and borrowings There can be no assurance that our investments to acquire Card Members provide differentiated features and services and increase usage of our cards will continue to be effective particularly with changing consumer and business behaviors as a result of the COVID19 pandemic In addition if we develop new products or offers that attract customers looking for shortterm incentives rather than incentivize longterm loyalty Card Member attrition and costs could increase Increasing spending on our cards also depends on our continued expansion of merchant acceptance of our cards If we are unable to continue growing merchant acceptance and perceptions of coverage or merchants decide to no longer accept American Express cards our business could suffer Expanding our service offerings adding customer acquisition channels and forming new partnerships or renewing current partnerships could have higher costs than our current arrangements and could adversely impact our average discount rate or dilute our brand Another way we invest in customer value is through our Membership Rewards program as well as other Card Member benefits Any significant change in or failure by management to reasonably estimate actual redemptions of Membership Rewards points and associated redemption costs could adversely affect our profitability We rely on third parties for certain redemption options and may not be able to continue to offer such redemption options in the future which could diminish the value of the program for our Card Members Our two largest redemption partners are Amazon and Delta In addition many credit card issuers have instituted rewards and cobrand programs and may introduce programs and services that are similar to or more attractive than ours Our inability to differentiate our products and services could materially adversely affect us We may not be able to costeffectively manage and expand Card Member benefits including containing the growth of marketing promotion rewards and Card Member services expenses in the future If such expenses increase beyond our expectations we will need to find ways to offset the financial impact by increasing payment volumes increasing other areas of revenues such as feebased revenues or both We may not succeed in doing so particularly in the current competitive and regulatory environment Our brand and reputation are key assets of our Company and our business may be materially affected by how we are perceived in the marketplace Our brand and its attributes are key assets and we believe our continued success depends on our ability to preserve grow and realize the benefits of the value of our brand Our ability to attract and retain consumer and small business Card Members and corporate clients is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our level of service trustworthiness business practices privacy and data protection management workplace culture merchant acceptance financial condition response to political and social issues or catastrophic events including our response to the COVID19 pandemic and natural disasters and other subjective qualities Negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters  even if related to seemingly isolated incidents and whether or not factually correctcould erode trust and confidence and damage our reputation among existing and potential Card Members corporate clients merchants and partners which could make it difficult for us to attract new customers and maintain existing ones Negative public opinion could result from actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities or circumstances including card practices regulatory compliance the use and protection of customer information conduct by our colleagues and policy engagement including activities of the American Express Company Political Action Committee and from actions taken by regulators or others in response thereto Discussion about such matters in social media channels can also cause rapid widespread reputational harm to our brand Our brand and reputation may also be harmed by actions taken by third parties that are outside our control For example any shortcoming of or controversy related to a thirdparty vendor business partner merchant acquirer or network partner may be attributed by Card Members and merchants to us thus damaging our reputation and brand value Acceptance of American Express cards by merchants in certain industries can also affect perceptions of us The lack of acceptance suppression of card usage or surcharging by merchants can also negatively impact perceptions of our brand and our products lower overall transaction volume and increase the attractiveness of other payment products or systems Adverse developments with respect to our industry may also by association negatively impact our reputation or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny or 28 Table of Contents litigation against us Furthermore as a corporation with headquarters and operations located in the United States a negative perception of the United States arising from its political or other positions could harm the perception of our company and our brand Although we monitor developments for areas of potential risk to our reputation and brand negative perceptions or publicity could materially and adversely affect our business volumes revenues and profitability A major information or cyber security incident or an increase in fraudulent activity could lead to reputational damage to our brand and material legal regulatory and financial exposure and could reduce the use and acceptance of our cards We and third parties process transmit store and provide access to account information in connection with our charge and credit cards and other products and in the normal course of our business we collect analyze and retain significant volumes of certain types of personally identifiable and other information pertaining to our customers and colleagues Our networks and systems are subject to constant attempts to identify and exploit potential vulnerabilities in our operating environment with intent to disrupt our business operations and capture destroy manipulate or expose various types of information relating to corporate trade secrets customer information including Card Member travel and loyalty program data colleague information and other sensitive business information including acquisition activity nonpublic financial results and intellectual property There are a number of motivations for cyber threat actors including criminal activities such as fraud identity theft and ransom corporate or nationstate espionage political agendas public embarrassment with the intent to cause financial or reputational harm intent to disrupt information technology systems and to expose and exploit potential security and privacy vulnerabilities in corporate systems and websites Global financial institutions like us as well as our customers colleagues regulators vendors and other third parties have experienced a significant increase in information and cyber security risk in recent years and will likely continue to be the target of increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks including computer viruses malicious or destructive code ransomware social engineering attacks including phishing impersonation and identity takeover attempts corporate espionage hacking website defacement denialofservice attacks exploitation of vulnerabilities and other attacks and similar disruptions from the misconfiguration or unauthorized use of or access to computer systems For example we and other US financial services providers have been the target of distributed denialofservice attacks from sophisticated third parties These threats can arise from external parties as well as insiders who knowingly or unknowingly engage in or enable malicious cyber activities We develop and maintain systems and processes aimed at detecting and preventing information and cyber security incidents and fraudulent activity which require significant investment maintenance and ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies and regulatory requirements change and as efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated Despite our efforts the possibility of information and cyber security incidents malicious social engineering corporate espionage fraudulent or other malicious activities and human error or malfeasance cannot be eliminated entirely and will evolve as new and emerging technology is deployed including the increasing use of personal mobile and computing devices that are outside of our network and control environments Risks associated with such incidents and activities include theft of funds and other monetary loss the disruption of our operations and the unauthorized disclosure release gathering monitoring misuse modification loss or destruction of confidential proprietary trade secret or other information including account data information the effects of which could be compounded if not detected or reported quickly Indeed an information or cyber security incident may not be detected until well after it occurs and the severity and potential impact may not be fully known for a substantial period of time after it has been discovered Information or cyber security incidents fraudulent activity and other actual or perceived failures to maintain confidentiality integrity privacy andor security has led to increased regulatory scrutiny and may lead to regulatory investigations and intervention such as mandatory card reissuance increased litigation including class action litigation remediation fines and response costs negative assessments of us and our subsidiaries by banking regulators and rating agencies reputational and financial damage to our brand and reduced usage of our products and services all of which could have a material adverse impact on our business The disclosure of sensitive company information could also undermine our competitive advantage and divert management attention and resources Successful cyberattacks data breaches disruptions or other incidents related to the actual or perceived failures to maintain confidentiality integrity privacy andor security at other large financial institutions large retailers travel and hospitality companies government agencies or other market participants whether or not we are impacted could lead to a general loss of customer confidence that could negatively affect us including harming the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures or harming the reputation of the financial system in general which could result in reduced use of our products and services Such events could also result in legislation and additional regulatory requirements Although we maintain cyber insurance there can be no assurance that liabilities or losses we may incur will be covered under such policies or that the amount of insurance will be adequate The uninterrupted operation of our information systems is critical to our success and a significant disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 29 Table of Contents Our information technology systems including our transaction authorization clearing and settlement systems and data centers may experience service disruptions or degradation because of technology malfunction sudden increases in customer transaction volume natural disasters accidents power outages internet outages telecommunications failures fraud denialofservice and other cyberattacks terrorism computer viruses vulnerabilities in hardware or software physical or electronic breakins or similar events Service disruptions or degradations could prevent access to our online services and account information compromise or limit access to company or customer data impede transaction processing and financial reporting and lead to regulatory investigations and fines increased regulatory oversight and litigation including class action litigation Any such service disruption or degradation could adversely affect the perception of the reliability of our products and services and materially adversely affect our overall business reputation and results of operations We rely on thirdparty providers for acquiring and servicing customers technology platforms and other services integral to the operations of our businesses These third parties may act in ways that could materially harm our business We rely on thirdparty service providers cobrand partners merchants customer acquisition channels processors aggregators network partners and other third parties for services that are integral to our operations and are subject to the risk that activities of such third parties may adversely affect our business As outsourcing specialization of functions thirdparty digital services and technology innovation within the payments industry increase including with respect to mobile technologies tokenization big data artificial intelligence and cloud storage solutions more third parties are involved in processing card transactions and handling our data For example we rely on third parties for the timely transmission of accurate information across our global network card acquisition and provision of services to our customers If a service provider or other third party ceases to provide the data quality or communications capacity we expect or services upon which we rely as a result of natural disaster operational disruptions or errors including as a result of the impacts of COVID19 terrorism information or cyber security incidents or any other reason the failure could interrupt or compromise the quality of our services to customers or impact our business A disruption or other event at a third party affecting one of our service providers or partners could also impede their ability to provide to us services or data on which we rely to operate our business Service providers or other third parties could also cease providing data to us or use our data in a way that diminishes the value of our closed loop The confidentiality integrity privacy availability andor security of data communicated over thirdparty networks or platforms or held by or accessible to third parties including merchants that accept our cards payment processors payment intermediaries and our thirdparty vendors and business partners could become compromised which could lead to unauthorized use of our data or fraudulent transactions on our cards as well as costs associated with responding to such an incident including regulatory investigations and fines increased regulatory oversight and litigation The management and oversight of multiple vendors increases our operational complexity and governance challenges and decreases our control A failure to exercise adequate oversight over service providers including compliance with service level agreements or regulatory or legal requirements could result in regulatory actions fines litigation sanctions or economic and reputational harm to us In addition we may not be able to effectively monitor or mitigate operational risks relating to our thirdparty providers service providers We are also exposed to the risk that a service disruption at a service provider common to our thirdparty providers could impede their ability to provide services to us Notwithstanding any attempts to diversify our reliance on third parties we may not be able to effectively mitigate operational risks relating to our thirdparty providers use of common service providers If we are not able to invest successfully in and compete at the leading edge of technological developments across all our businesses our revenue and profitability could be materially adversely affected Our industry is subject to rapid and significant technological changes In order to compete in our industry we need to continue to invest in technology across all areas of our business including in transaction processing data management and analytics machine learning and artificial intelligence customer interactions and communications open banking and alternative payment and financing mechanisms authentication technologies and digital identification tokenization realtime settlement and risk management and compliance systems Incorporating new technologies into our products and services including developing the appropriate governance and controls consistent with regulatory expectations requires substantial expenditures and takes considerable time and ultimately may not be successful We expect that new technologies in the payments industry will continue to emerge and these new technologies may be superior to or render obsolete our existing technology The process of developing new products and services enhancing existing products and services and adapting to technological changes and evolving industry standards is complex costly and uncertain and any failure by us to anticipate customers changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly impede our ability to compete effectively Consumer and merchant adoption is a key competitive factor and our competitors may develop products platforms or technologies that become more widely adopted than ours In addition we may underestimate the time and expense we must invest in new products and services before they generate significant revenues if at all Our use of artificial intelligence and machine learning is subject to risks related to flaws in our algorithms and datasets that may be insufficient or contain biased information These deficiencies could undermine the decisions predictions or analysis such technologies produce subjecting us to competitive harm legal liability and brand or reputational harm 30 Table of Contents Our ability to develop acquire or access competitive technologies or business processes on acceptable terms may also be limited by intellectual property rights that third parties including those that current and potential competitors may assert In addition our ability to adopt new technologies may be inhibited by the emergence of industrywide standards a changing legislative and regulatory environment an inability to develop appropriate governance and controls a lack of internal product and engineering expertise resistance to change from Card Members or merchants lack of appropriate change management processes or the complexity of our systems We may not be successful in realizing the benefits associated with our acquisitions strategic alliances joint ventures and investment activity and our business and reputation could be materially adversely affected We have acquired a number of businesses including Kabbage and have made a number of strategic investments and continue to evaluate potential transactions There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully identify suitable candidates value potential investment or acquisition opportunities accurately negotiate acceptable terms for those opportunities or complete proposed acquisitions and investments The process of integrating an acquired company business or technology could create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures result in unanticipated liabilities including legal claims violations of laws commercial disputes and information security vulnerabilities or breaches including from not integrating the acquired company business or technology quickly or appropriately from activities that occurred prior to the acquisition and from exposure to third party relationships of the acquired company or business or new laws and regulations and harm our business generally It may take us longer than expected to fully realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions and those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all which could materially adversely affect our business and operating results including as a result of writedowns of goodwill and other intangible assets We may also face risks with other types of strategic transactions such as the sale to InComm of the operations relating to our prepaid reloadable and gift card business The reloadable operations have experienced disruptions in the past impacting the ability of our prepaid customers to load and use their cards If such operations are interrupted suspended or terminated in the future it could further negatively impact our customers experience result in additional costs litigation and regulatory action and harm our business and reputation Joint ventures including our GBT JV and our joint venture in China and minority investments inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations thereby potentially increasing the financial legal operational andor compliance risks associated with the joint venture or minority investment including as a result of becoming subject to different laws or regulations In addition we may be dependent on joint venture partners controlling shareholders or management who may have business interests strategies or goals that are inconsistent with ours For example trade secrets and other proprietary information we may provide to a joint venture may become available to third parties beyond our control The ability to enforce intellectual property and contractual rights to prevent disclosure of our trade secrets and other proprietary information may be limited in certain jurisdictions Business decisions or other actions or omissions of the joint venture partner controlling shareholders or management may adversely affect the value of our investment result in litigation or regulatory action against us and otherwise damage our reputation and brand Our success is dependent on maintaining a culture of integrity and respect the resilience of our colleagues through the pandemic and upon our executive officers and other key personnel and misconduct by or loss of key personnel could materially adversely affect our business We rely upon our key personnel not only for business success but also to lead with integrity and promote a culture of respect To the extent our leaders behave in a manner that does not comport with our companys values the consequences to our brand and reputation could be severe and could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations Our colleagues have had to adapt to rapidly changing conditions during the pandemic and if we are unable to continue addressing the safety health and productivity of our colleagues our business could suffer The market for qualified individuals is highly competitive and we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel or candidates to replace or succeed members of our senior management team or other key personnel who voluntarily or involuntarily leave the company Changes in immigration and work permit laws and regulations or the administration or enforcement of such laws or regulations or other changes in the legal or regulatory environment including as a result of Brexit can also impair our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel or to employ such personnel in the locations of our choice Our compensation practices are subject to review and oversight by the Federal Reserve and the compensation practices of AENB are subject to review and oversight by the OCC This regulatory review and oversight could further affect our ability to attract and retain our executive officers and other key personnel The loss of key personnel could materially adversely affect our business Legal Regulatory and Compliance Risks Our business is subject to comprehensive government regulation and supervision which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 31 Table of Contents We are subject to comprehensive government regulation and supervision in jurisdictions around the world which significantly affects our business and requires continual enhancement of our compliance efforts Supervision efforts and the enforcement of existing laws and regulations impact the scope and profitability of our existing business activities limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities and adopt new technologies compromise our competitive position and affect our relationships with Card Members partners merchants vendors and other third parties New laws or regulations could similarly affect our business increase our costs of doing business and require us to change certain of our business practices and invest significant management attention and resources all of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition Legislators and regulators around the world are aware of each others approaches to the regulation of the payments industry Consequently a development in one country state or region may influence regulatory approaches in another To the extent that different regulatory systems impose overlapping or inconsistent requirements on the conduct of our business we face complexity and additional costs in our compliance efforts If we fail to satisfy regulatory requirements or maintain our financial holding company status our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected and we may be restricted in our ability to take certain capital actions such as declaring dividends or repurchasing outstanding shares or engage in certain business activities or acquisitions which could compromise our competitive position Additionally our banking regulators have wide discretion in the examination and the enforcement of applicable banking statutes and regulations and may restrict our ability to engage in certain business activities or acquisitions or require us to maintain more capital In recent years legislators and regulators have focused on the operation of card networks including interchange fees paid to card issuers in payment networks such as Visa and Mastercard and the fees merchants are charged to accept cards Even where we are not directly regulated regulation of bankcard fees significantly negatively impacts the discount revenue derived from our business including as a result of downward pressure on our discount rate from decreases in competitor pricing in connection with caps on interchange fees In some cases regulations also extend to certain aspects of our business such as network and cobrand arrangements or the terms of card acceptance for merchants including terms relating to nondiscrimination and honorallcards For example we have exited our network businesses in the EU and Australia as a result of regulation in those jurisdictions In addition there is uncertainty as to when or how interchange fee caps and other provisions of the EU payments legislation might apply when we work with cobrand partners and agents in the EU In a ruling issued on February 7 2018 the EU Court of Justice confirmed the validity of the application of the fee caps and other provisions in circumstances where threeparty networks issue cards with a cobrand partner or through an agent although the ruling provided only limited guidance as to when or how the provisions might apply in such circumstances and remains subject to differing interpretations by regulators and participants in cobrand arrangements As a result we are subject to regulatory action penalties and the possibility we will not be able to maintain our existing cobrand and agent relationships in the EU We are subject to certain provisions of the Bank Secrecy Act as amended by the Patriot Act and the AMLA with regard to maintaining effective AML programs Similar AML requirements apply under the laws of most jurisdictions where we operate As regulators increase their focus in this area we are likely to face increased costs related to oversight supervision and fines and changes to our business practices including restrictions with respect to the types of products and services we may offer the countries in which our cards may be used and the types of customers and merchants who can obtain or accept our cards Emerging technologies such as digital currencies could limit our ability to track the movement of funds Money laundering terrorist financing and other illicit activities involving our business could result in enforcement action and our reputation may suffer due to our customers association with certain countries persons or entities or the existence of any such transactions Various regulatory agencies and legislatures are also considering regulations and legislation covering identity theft account management guidelines credit bureau reporting disclosure rules security and marketing that would impact us directly in part due to increased scrutiny of our underwriting and account management standards These new requirements may restrict our ability to issue charge and credit cards or partner with other financial institutions which could adversely affect our revenue growth See Supervision and Regulation for more information about certain laws and regulations to which we are subject and their impact on us Litigation and regulatory actions could subject us to significant fines penalties judgments andor requirements resulting in significantly increased expenses damage to our reputation andor a material adverse effect on our business Businesses in the financial services and payments industries have historically been subject to significant legal actions including class action lawsuits Many of these actions have included claims for substantial compensatory or punitive damages While we have historically relied on our arbitration clause in agreements with customers to limit our exposure to class action litigation there can be no assurance that we will continue to be successful in enforcing our arbitration clause in the future including as a result of regulation that would require that our consumer arbitration clause not apply to cases filed in court as class actions and claims of the type we previously arbitrated could be subject to the complexities risks and costs associated with class action cases The continued focus of merchants on issues relating to the acceptance of various forms of payment may lead to additional litigation and other legal actions Given the inherent uncertainties involved in litigation and the very large or indeterminate 32 Table of Contents damages sought in some matters asserted against us there is significant uncertainty as to the ultimate liability we may incur from litigation We have been subject to regulatory actions and may continue to be subject to such actions including governmental inquiries investigations and enforcement proceedings in the event of noncompliance or alleged noncompliance with laws or regulations External publicity concerning investigations including those that are narrow in scope can increase their scope and scale and lead to further regulatory inquiries Beginning in May 2020 we began responding to a regulatory review led by the OCC and the Department of Justice Civil Division regarding historical sales practices relating to certain small business card sales We also conducted an internal review of certain sales from 2015 and 2016 and have taken appropriate disciplinary and remedial actions including voluntarily providing remediation to certain current and former customers Information regarding our investigation has been provided to our other regulators including the Federal Reserve In January 2021 we received a grand jury subpoena from the United States Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of New York regarding the sales practices for small business cards and a Civil Investigative Demand from the CFPB seeking information on sales practices related to consumers We are cooperating with all of these inquiries and have continued to enhance our controls related to our sales practices We do not believe this matter will have a material adverse impact on our business or results of operations We expect that regulators will continue taking formal enforcement actions against financial institutions in addition to addressing supervisory concerns through nonpublic supervisory actions or findings which could involve restrictions on our activities among other limitations that could adversely affect our business In addition a violation of law or regulation by another financial institution could give rise to an investigation by regulators and other governmental agencies of the same or similar practices by us Further a single event may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and proceedings Regulatory action could subject us to significant fines penalties or other requirements resulting in Card Member reimbursements increased expenses limitations or conditions on our business activities and damage to our reputation and our brand all of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition Governmental authorities have adopted or proposed measures to provide economic assistance to individual households and businesses stabilize markets and support economic growth The future success of these measures is unknown and they may not be sufficient to mitigate the negative impact of the pandemic Additionally some measures such as a suspension of loan payments and encouragement of forbearances may have a negative impact on our business results of operations and financial condition We also face an increased risk of litigation and governmental and regulatory scrutiny as a result of the effects of the pandemic on market and economic conditions such as a renewed focus on fair lending laws and actions governmental authorities take in response to those conditions including participation in the PPP Legal proceedings regarding provisions in our merchant contracts including nondiscrimination and honorallcards provisions could have a material adverse effect on our business and result in additional litigation andor arbitrations substantial monetary damages and damage to our reputation and brand We are and have been in the past a defendant in a number of actions including legal proceedings and proposed class actions filed by merchants challenging certain provisions of our card acceptance agreements See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our outstanding material legal proceedings An adverse outcome in these proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations require us to change our merchant agreements in a way that could expose our cards to increased merchant steering and other forms of discrimination that could impair the Card Member experience result in additional litigation andor arbitrations impose substantial monetary damages and damage our reputation and brand Even if we were not required to change our merchant agreements changes in Visas and Mastercards policies or practices as a result of legal proceedings lawsuit settlements or regulatory actions pending against them could result in changes to our business practices and materially and adversely impact our profitability We are subject to capital adequacy and liquidity rules and if we fail to meet these rules our business would be materially adversely affected Failure to meet current or future capital or liquidity requirements could compromise our competitive position and could result in restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve including limiting our ability to pay dividends repurchase our capital stock invest in our business expand our business or engage in acquisitions Some elements of the capital and liquidity regimes are not yet final and certain developments could significantly impact the requirements applicable to financial institutions For example the Basel Committee finalized revisions to the standardized approach for credit risk and operational risk capital requirements If these revisions are adopted in the United States we could be required to hold significantly more capital In addition it may be necessary for us to hold additional capital because of an increase in the SCB requirement based on the results from a supervisory stress test Compliance with capital adequacy and liquidity rules requires a material investment of resources An inability to meet regulatory expectations regarding our compliance with applicable capital adequacy and liquidity rules may also negatively impact the assessment of us and our US bank subsidiary by federal banking regulators 33 Table of Contents For more information on capital adequacy requirements see Capital and Liquidity Regulation under Supervision and Regulation We are subject to restrictions that limit our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our capital stock Our subsidiaries are also subject to restrictions that limit their ability to pay dividends to us which may adversely affect our liquidity We are limited in our ability to pay dividends and repurchase capital stock by our regulators who have broad authority to prohibit any action that would be considered an unsafe or unsound banking practice For example the Federal Reserve prohibited share repurchases in the third and fourth quarters of 2020 for all banking organizations participating in CCAR and has limited distributions for the first quarter of 2021 We are subject to a requirement to submit capital plans to the Federal Reserve for review that include among other things projected dividend payments and repurchases of capital stock As part of the capital planning and stress testing process our proposed capital actions are assessed against our ability to satisfy applicable capital requirements in the event of a stressed market environment If we fail to satisfy applicable capital requirements including the stress capital buffer our ability to undertake capital actions may be restricted Our ability to declare or pay dividends on or to purchase redeem or otherwise acquire shares of our common stock will be prohibited subject to certain exceptions in the event that we do not declare and pay in full dividends for the last preceding dividend period of our Series B and Series C preferred stock American Express Company relies on dividends from its subsidiaries for liquidity and such dividends may be limited by law regulation or supervisory policy For example our US bank subsidiary AENB is subject to various statutory and regulatory limitations on its declaration and payment of dividends These limitations may hinder our ability to access funds we may need to make payments on our obligations make dividend payments on outstanding American Express Company capital stock or otherwise achieve strategic objectives Any future reduction or elimination of our common stock dividend or share repurchase program could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and market perceptions of American Express For more information on bank holding company and depository institution dividend restrictions see Stress Testing and Capital Planning and Dividends and Other Capital Distributions under Supervision and Regulation as well as Consolidated Capital Resources and LiquidityDividends and Share Repurchases under MDA and Note 22 to our Consolidated Financial Statements Regulation in the areas of privacy data protection data governance account access and information and cyber security could increase our costs and affect or limit our business opportunities and how we collect andor use personal information Legislators and regulators in the United States and other countries in which we operate are increasingly adopting or revising privacy data protection data governance account access and information and cyber security laws including data localization authentication and notification laws As such laws are interpreted and applied in some cases with significant differences or conflicting requirements across jurisdictions compliance and technology costs will continue to increase particularly in the context of ensuring that adequate data governance data protection data transfer and account access mechanisms are in place Compliance with current or future privacy data protection data governance account access and information and cyber security laws could significantly impact our collection use sharing retention and safeguarding of consumer andor colleague information and could restrict our ability to fully maximize our closedloop capability or provide certain products and services which could materially and adversely affect our profitability Our failure to comply with such laws could result in potentially significant regulatory andor governmental investigations andor actions litigation fines sanctions ongoing regulatory monitoring customer attrition decreases in the use or acceptance of our cards and damage to our reputation and our brand In recent years there has been increasing regulatory enforcement and litigation activity in the areas of privacy data protection and information and cyber security in the United States the EU and various other countries in which we operate For more information on regulatory and legislative activity in this area see Privacy Data Protection Data Governance Information and Cyber Security under Supervision and Regulation We may not be able to effectively manage the operational and compliance risks to which we are exposed We consider operational risk to be the risk of loss due to among other things inadequate or failed processes people or information systems or impacts from the external environment eg natural disasters Operational risk includes among others the risk that error or misconduct could result in a material financial misstatement a failure to monitor a third partys compliance with regulatory or legal requirements or a failure to adequately monitor and control access to or use of data in our systems we grant to third parties As processes or organizations are changed or new products and services are introduced we may not fully appreciate or identify new operational risks that may arise from such changes Through human error fraud or malfeasance conduct risk can result in harm to customers broader markets and the company and its employees Compliance risk arises from the failure to adhere to applicable laws rules regulations and internal policies and procedures We need to continually update and enhance our control environment to address operational and compliance risks Operational and compliance failures or deficiencies in our control environment can expose us to reputational and legal risks as well as fines 34 Table of Contents civil money penalties or payment of damages and can lead to diminished business opportunities and diminished ability to expand key operations If we are not able to protect our intellectual property or successfully defend against any infringement or misappropriation assertions brought against us our revenue and profitability could be negatively affected We rely on a variety of measures to protect our intellectual property and control access to and distribution of our trade secrets and other proprietary information These measures may not prevent infringement of our intellectual property rights or misappropriation of our proprietary information and a resulting loss of competitive advantage The ability to enforce intellectual property rights to prevent disclosure of our trade secrets and other proprietary information may be limited in certain jurisdictions In addition competitors or other third parties may allege that our products systems processes or technologies infringe on their intellectual property rights Given the complex rapidly changing and competitive technological and business environments in which we operate and the potential risks and uncertainties of intellectual propertyrelated litigation a future assertion of an infringement or misappropriation claim against us could cause us to lose significant revenues incur significant defense license royalty or technology development expenses andor pay significant monetary damages Tax legislative initiatives or assessments could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition We are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and in various foreign jurisdictions The laws and regulations related to tax matters are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations Although management believes our positions are reasonable we are subject to audit by the Internal Revenue Service in the United States and by tax authorities in all the jurisdictions in which we conduct business operations We are being challenged in a number of countries regarding our application of valueadded taxes VAT to certain transactions While we believe we comply with all applicable VAT and other tax laws rules and regulations in the relevant jurisdictions the tax authorities may determine that we owe additional taxes or apply existing laws and regulations more broadly which could result in a significant increase in liabilities for taxes and interest in excess of accrued liabilities New tax legislative initiatives including increases in the corporate tax rate may be enacted impacting our effective tax rate and potentially adversely affecting our tax positions or tax liabilities In addition unilateral or multijurisdictional actions by various tax authorities including an increase in tax audit activity could have an adverse impact on our tax liabilities Credit Liquidity and Market Risks Our risk management policies and procedures may not be effective Our risk management framework seeks to identify and mitigate risk and appropriately balance risk and return Although we have devoted significant resources to develop our risk management policies and procedures and expect to continue to do so in the future these policies and procedures as well as our risk management techniques such as our hedging strategies may not be fully effective There may also be risks that exist or develop in the future that we have not appropriately identified or mitigated As regulations and competition continue to evolve our risk management framework may not always keep sufficient pace with those changes If our risk management framework does not effectively identify or mitigate our risks we could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected Management of our risks in some cases depends upon the use of analytical andor forecasting models Although we have a governance framework for model development and independent model validation the modeling methodology or key assumptions could be erroneous or the models could be misused In addition issues with the quality or effectiveness of our data aggregation and validation procedures as well as the quality and integrity of data inputs could result in ineffective or inaccurate model outputs and reports For example models based on historical data sets might not be accurate predictors of future outcomes and their ability to appropriately predict future outcomes may degrade over time The CECL methodology requires measurement of expected credit losses for the estimated life of certain financial instruments not only based on historical experience and current conditions but also by including forecasts incorporating forwardlooking information Our ability to accurately forecast future losses under that methodology may be impaired by the significant uncertainty surrounding the pandemic and the lack of comparable precedent If our business decisions or estimates for credit losses are based on incorrect or misused models and assumptions or we fail to manage data inputs effectively and to aggregate or analyze data in an accurate and timely manner our results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected We are exposed to credit risk and trends that affect Card Member spending and the ability of customers and partners to pay us which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition We are exposed to both individual credit risk principally from consumer and small business Card Member loans and receivables and institutional credit risk principally from corporate Card Member loans and receivables merchants network partners loyalty coalition partners and treasury and investment counterparties Third parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons General economic factors such as GDP unemployment inflation and interest rates may result in greater delinquencies that lead to greater credit losses A customers ability and willingness to repay us can be negatively impacted not only by economic market political and social conditions but 35 Table of Contents also by a customers other payment obligations and increasing leverage can result in a higher risk that customers will default or become delinquent in their obligations to us Our caution about the potential for a significant downturn in the pace of economic recovery is reflected in the macroeconomic outlook that informs our reserves for credit losses We rely principally on the customers creditworthiness for repayment of loans or receivables and therefore have no other recourse for collection Our ability to assess creditworthiness may be impaired if the criteria or models we use to manage our credit risk prove inaccurate in predicting future losses which could cause our losses to rise and have a negative impact on our results of operations Further our pricing strategies may not offset the negative impact on profitability caused by increases in delinquencies and losses thus any material increases in delinquencies and losses beyond our current estimates could have a material adverse impact on us Although we make estimates to provide for credit losses in our outstanding portfolio of loans and receivables these estimates may not be accurate In addition the information we use in managing our credit risk may be inaccurate or incomplete Rising delinquencies and rising rates of bankruptcy are often precursors of future writeoffs and may require us to increase our reserve for credit losses Higher writeoff rates and the resulting increase in our reserves for credit losses adversely affect our profitability and the performance of our securitizations and may increase our cost of funds Although we regularly review our credit exposure to specific clients and counterparties and to specific industries countries and regions that we believe may present credit concerns default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to foresee or detect such as fraud In addition our ability to manage credit risk or collect amounts owed to us may be adversely affected by legal or regulatory changes such as restrictions on collections or changes in bankruptcy laws minimum payment regulations and reage guidance Increased credit risk whether resulting from underestimating the credit losses inherent in our portfolio of loans and receivables deteriorating economic conditions particularly in the United States where for example Card Members were responsible for approximately 87 percent of our total Card Member loans outstanding as of December 31 2020 increases in the level of loan balances changes in our mix of business or otherwise could require us to increase our provisions for losses and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition Interest rate changes could materially adversely affect our earnings Our interest expense was approximately 21 billion for the year ended December 31 2020 If the rate of interest we pay on our borrowings increases more or decreases less than the rate of interest we earn on our loans our net interest yield and consequently our net interest income could decrease As of December 31 2020 a hypothetical immediate 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would have a detrimental impact on our annual net interest income of up to 113 million A hypothetical immediate 100 basis point decrease in market interest rates would have a smaller but still detrimental impact on our annual net interest income We expect the rates we pay on our deposits will change if benchmark interest rates change In addition interest rate changes may affect customer behavior such as impacting the loan balances Card Members carry on their credit cards or their ability to make payments as higher interest rates lead to higher payment requirements further impacting our results of operations For a further discussion of our interest rate risk see Risk Management  Market Risk Management Process under MDA The discontinuance of LIBOR may negatively impact our access to funding and the value of our financial instruments and commercial agreements Central banks and global regulators have called for financial market participants to prepare for the discontinuance of the London interbank offered rate LIBOR and the establishment of alternative reference rates Certain of our financial instruments and commercial agreements reference LIBOR which will need to be amended or otherwise modified to replace LIBOR with an alternative reference rate Some of those instruments and agreements contain provisions to replace LIBOR as the benchmark following the occurrence of specified transition events Such provisions may not be sufficient to trigger a change in the benchmark at all times when LIBOR is no longer representative of market interest rates or that these events will align with similar events in the market generally or in other parts of the financial markets such as the derivatives market Alternative reference rates are calculated using components different from those used in the calculation of LIBOR and may fluctuate differently than and not be representative of LIBOR In order to compensate for these differences certain of our financial instruments and commercial agreements allow for a benchmark replacement adjustment However there is no assurance that any benchmark replacement adjustment will be sufficient to produce the economic equivalent of LIBOR either at the benchmark replacement date or over the life of such instruments and agreements Uncertainty as to the nature and timing of the potential discontinuance or modification of LIBOR the replacement of LIBOR with one or more alternative reference rates or other reforms may negatively impact market liquidity our access to funding and the trading market for our financial instruments Furthermore the timing of implementation and use of alternative reference rates and corresponding adjustments or other reforms could be subject to disputes could cause the interest payable on our outstanding financial instruments and commercial agreements to be materially different than expected and may impact the value of such instruments and agreements 36 Table of Contents Adverse market conditions may significantly affect our access to and cost of capital and ability to meet liquidity needs Our ability to obtain financing in the debt capital markets for unsecured term debt and asset securitizations is dependent on financial market conditions Disruptions uncertainty or volatility across the financial markets as well as adverse developments affecting our competitors and the financial industry generally could negatively impact market liquidity and limit our access to funding required to operate our business Such market conditions may also limit our ability to replace in a timely manner maturing liabilities satisfy regulatory capital requirements and access the funding necessary to grow our business In some circumstances we may incur an unattractive cost to raise capital which could decrease profitability and significantly reduce financial flexibility For a further discussion of our liquidity and funding needs see Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity under MDA Any reduction in our and our subsidiaries credit ratings could increase the cost of our funding from and restrict our access to the capital markets and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition Rating agencies regularly evaluate us and our subsidiaries and their ratings of our and our subsidiaries longterm and shortterm debt and deposits are based on a number of factors including financial strength as well as factors not within our control including conditions affecting the financial services industry generally and the wider state of the economy Our and our subsidiaries ratings could be downgraded at any time and without any notice by any of the rating agencies which could among other things adversely limit our access to the capital markets and adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we and our subsidiaries are able to obtain funding Adverse currency fluctuations and foreign exchange controls could decrease earnings we receive from our international operations and impact our capital During 2020 approximately 22 percent of our total revenues net of interest expense were generated from activities outside the United States We are exposed to foreign exchange risk from our international operations and accordingly the revenue we generate outside the United States is subject to unpredictable fluctuations if the values of other currencies change relative to the US dollar including as a result of Brexit which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations Foreign exchange regulations or capital controls might restrict or prohibit the conversion of other currencies into US dollars or our ability to transfer them Political and economic conditions in other countries could also impact the availability of foreign exchange for the payment to us by the local card issuer for obligations arising out of local Card Members spending outside such country and for the payment by Card Members who are billed in a currency other than their local currency Substantial and sudden devaluation of local Card Members currency can also affect their ability to make payments to the local issuer of the card in connection with spending outside the local country The occurrence of any of these circumstances could further impact our results of operations An inability to accept or maintain deposits due to market demand or regulatory constraints could materially adversely affect our liquidity position and our ability to fund our business Our US bank subsidiary AENB accepts deposits directly from consumers as well as from individuals through thirdparty brokerage networks and uses the proceeds as a source of funding As of December 31 2020 we had approximately 86 billion in total US retail deposits a portion of which had been raised through thirdparty brokerage networks We face strong and increasing competition with regard to deposits and pricing and product changes may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain costeffective deposit balances To the extent we offer higher interest rates to attract or maintain deposits our funding costs will be adversely impacted Our ability to obtain deposit funding and offer competitive interest rates on deposits is also dependent on AENBs capital levels The FDIAs brokered deposit provisions and related FDIC rules in certain circumstances prohibit banks from accepting or renewing brokered deposits and apply other restrictions such as a cap on interest rates that can be paid Additionally our regulators can adjust applicable capital requirements at any time and have authority to place limitations on our deposit businesses An inability to attract or maintain deposits in the future could materially adversely affect our ability to fund our business The value of our investments may be adversely impacted by economic political or market conditions Market risk includes the loss in value of portfolios and financial instruments due to adverse changes in market variables which could negatively impact our financial condition We held approximately 22 billion of investment securities as of December 31 2020 In the event that actual default rates of these investment securities were to significantly change from historical patterns due to economic conditions or otherwise it could have a material adverse impact on the value of our investment portfolio potentially resulting in impairment charges Defaults or economic disruptions even in countries or territories in which we do not have material investment exposure conduct business or have operations could adversely affect us
