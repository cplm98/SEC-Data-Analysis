provide a summary of our diverse set of customers and broad geographic footprint Partners and Relationships Our integrated payments platform allows us to work with a range of business partners and our partners in return help drive the scale and relevance of the platform There are many examples of how we connect partners with our integrated payments platform including issuing cards under cobrand arrangements with other corporations and institutions eg Delta Air Lines Marriott International British Airways and Hilton Worldwide Holdings offering innovative ways for our Card Members to earn and use points with our merchants eg Pay with Points at Amazoncom expanding merchant acceptance with thirdparty acquirers and processors eg OptBlue partners developing new capabilities and features with

Express leisure and business travel eg Fine Hotels and Resorts Delta Air Lines is our largest strategic partner Our relationships with and revenues and expenses related to Delta are significant and represent a significant source of value for our Card Members We issue cards under cobrand arrangements with Delta and the Delta cobrand portfolio represented approximately 8 percent of our worldwide billed business and approximately 22 percent of worldwide Card Member loans as of December 31 2019 The Delta cobrand portfolio generates fee revenue and interest income from Card Members and discount revenue from Delta and other merchants for spending on Delta cobrand cards During 2019 we signed an 11year renewal extending the Delta cobrand relationship through the end of 2029 and expect to continue to make significant investments in this partnership going forward Among other things Delta is also a key participant in our Membership Rewards program provides travelrelated benefits and

will continue to seek to provide value choice and unique experiences across our customer base Our SpendCentric Model and Revenue Mix Our spendcentric business model focuses on generating revenues primarily by driving spending on our cards and secondarily through finance charges and fees Spending on our cards which is higher on average on a percard basis versus our competitors offers superior value to merchants in the form of loyal customers and larger transactions Because of the revenues generated from having highspending Card Members and the annual card fees we charge on many of our products we are able to invest in attractive rewards and other benefits for Card Members as well as targeted marketing and other programs and investments for merchants This creates incentives for Card Members to spend more on their cards and positively differentiates American Express cards We believe our spendcentric model gives us the ability to provide differentiated value to Card Members merchants and business partners 3 Table of Contents The American Express Brand and Service Excellence Our brand and its attributestrust security and serviceare key assets We invest heavily in managing marketing promoting and protecting our brand including through the delivery of our products and services in a manner consistent with our brand promise The American Express brand is consistently ranked as one of the most valuable brands in the world We place significant importance on trademarks service marks and patents and seek to secure our intellectual property rights around the world We aim to

our network partners to offer expanded products and services Finally we want to continue to make American Express an essential part of our customers digital lives by developing more digital features solutions and services expanding our digital partnerships and making targeted acquisitions COMPETITION We compete in the global payments industry with card networks issuers and acquirers paperbased transactions eg cash and checks bank transfer models eg wire transfers and Automated Clearing House or ACH as well as evolving and growing alternative payment and financing providers As the payments industry continues to evolve we face increasing competition from nontraditional players that leverage new technologies business models and customer relationships to create payment or financing solutions As a card issuer we compete with financial institutions that issue generalpurpose charge and credit cards and debit cards We also encounter competition from businesses that issue their own private label cards operate their own mobile wallets or extend credit to their customers We face intense competition for cobrand relationships as both card issuer and network competitors have targeted key business partners with attractive value propositions Our global card network competes in the global payments industry with other card networks including among others China UnionPay Visa Mastercard JCB Discover and Diners Club International which is owned by Discover We are the fourth largest generalpurpose card network globally based on purchase volume behind China UnionPay Visa and Mastercard In addition to such networks a range of companies globally including merchant acquirers processors and web and mobilebased payment platforms eg Alipay PayPal and Venmo as well as regional payment networks such as the National Payments Corporation of India carry out some activities similar to those performed by our GMNS business The principal competitive factors that affect the cardissuing merchant and network businesses include  The features value and quality of the products and services including customer care rewards programs partnerships benefits and digital and mobile services and the costs associated with providing such features and services  Reputation and brand recognition  The number spending characteristics and credit performance of customers 4 Table of Contents  The quantity diversity and quality of the establishments where the cards can be used  The attractiveness of the value proposition to card issuers merchant acquirers cardholders corporate clients and merchants including the relative cost of using or accepting the products and services and capabilities such as fraud prevention and data analytics  The number and quality of other payment cards and other forms of payment available to customers  The success of marketing and promotional campaigns  The speed of innovation and investment in systems technologies and product and service offerings  The nature and quality of expense management tools electronic payment methods and data capture and reporting capabilities particularly for business customers  The security of cardholder and merchant information Another aspect of competition is the dynamic and rapid growth of alternative payment mechanisms systems and products which include payment aggregators eg PayPal Square and Amazon marketplace lenders wireless payment technologies including using mobile telephone networks to carry out transactions financial technology companies electronic wallet and push payment providers including handset manufacturers telecommunication providers retailers banks and technology companies digital currencies developed by both governments and the private sector blockchain and similar distributed ledger technologies realtime settlement and processing prepaid systems and gift cards and systems linked to payment cards or that provide payment solutions Various competitors are working to integrate more financial services into their product offerings and competitors are attempting to replicate our closedloop functionality such as the merchantprocessing platform ChaseNet New payments competitors continue to emerge in response to evolving technologies consumer habits and merchant needs In addition to the discussion in this section see  Our operating results may materially suffer because of substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the payments industry  in Risk Factors for further discussion of the potential impact of competition on our business and  Our business is subject to comprehensive government regulation and supervision which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and  Legal proceedings regarding provisions in our merchant contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business and result in additional litigation andor arbitrations substantial monetary damages and damage to our reputation and brand  in Risk Factors for a discussion of the potential impact on our ability to compete effectively due to government regulations or if ongoing legal proceedings limit our ability to prevent merchants from engaging in various actions to discriminate against our card products 5 Table of Contents SUPERVISION AND REGULATION Overview We are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision in jurisdictions around the world and the costs of compliance are substantial In recent years the financial services industry has been subject to rigorous scrutiny high regulatory expectations an increasing range of regulations and a stringent and unpredictable enforcement environment Governmental authorities have focused and we believe will continue to focus considerable attention on reviewing compliance by financial services firms with laws and regulations and as a result we continually work to evolve and improve our risk management framework governance structures practices and procedures Reviews to assess compliance with laws and regulations by governmental authorities as well as our own internal reviews have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in changes to our products practices and procedures restitution to our customers and increased costs related to regulatory oversight supervision and examination We have also been subject to regulatory actions and may continue to be the subject of such actions including governmental inquiries investigations enforcement proceedings and the imposition of fines or civil money penalties in the event of noncompliance or alleged noncompliance with laws or regulations In addition legislators and regulators in various countries in which we operate have focused on the operation of card networks including through antitrust actions legislation and regulations to change certain practices or pricing of card issuers merchant acquirers and payment networks and in some cases to establish broad and ongoing regulatory oversight regimes for payment systems See Risk FactorsLegal Regulatory and Compliance Risks for a discussion of the potential impact legislative and regulatory changes may have on our results of operations and financial condition Banking Regulation Federal and state banking laws regulations and policies extensively regulate the Company which for purposes of this section refers to American Express Company as a bank holding company TRS and our US bank subsidiary American Express National Bank AENB Both the Company and TRS are subject to comprehensive consolidated supervision regulation and examination by the Federal Reserve and AENB is likewise supervised regulated and examined by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency OCC The Company and its subsidiaries are also subject to the rulemaking enforcement and examination authority of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau CFPB Banking regulators have broad examination and enforcement power including the power to impose substantial fines limit dividends and other capital distributions restrict operations and acquisitions and require divestitures Many aspects of our business also are subject to rigorous regulation by other US federal and state regulatory agencies and by nonUS government agencies and regulatory bodies The Federal Reserve has established a new rating system for large financial institutions such as the Company which is intended to align with the Federal Reserves existing supervisory program for large financial institutions and which includes component ratings for capital planning liquidity risk management and governance and controls In August 2017 and January 2018 the Federal Reserve proposed related guidance for the governance and controls component Activities The BHC Act generally limits bank holding companies to activities that are considered to be banking activities and certain closely related activities As noted above each of the Company and TRS is a bank holding company and each has elected to become a financial holding company which is authorized to engage in a broader range of financial and related activities In order to remain eligible for financial holding company status we must meet certain eligibility requirements Those requirements include that each of the Company and AENB must be well capitalized and well managed and AENB must have received at least a satisfactory rating on its most recent assessment under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 the CRA The Company and TRS engage in various activities permissible only for financial holding companies including in particular providing travel agency services acting as a finder and engaging in certain insurance underwriting and agency services If the Company fails to meet eligibility requirements for financial holding company status it is likely to be barred from engaging in new types of financial activities or making certain types of acquisitions or investments in reliance on its status as a financial holding company and ultimately could be required to either discontinue the broader range of activities permitted to financial holding companies or divest AENB In addition the Company and its subsidiaries are prohibited by law from engaging in practices that the relevant regulatory authority deems unsafe or unsound which such authorities generally interpret broadly 6 Table of Contents Acquisitions and Investments Applicable federal and state laws place limitations on the ability of persons to invest in or acquire control of us without providing notice to or obtaining the approval of one or more of our regulators In addition we are subject to banking laws and regulations that limit our investments and acquisitions and in some cases subject them to the prior review and approval of our regulators including the Federal Reserve and the OCC Federal banking regulators have broad discretion in evaluating proposed acquisitions and investments that are subject to their prior review or approval Financial Regulatory Reform In October 2019 the US federal bank regulatory agencies finalized rules that tailor the application of the enhanced prudential standards to bank holding companies and depository institutions the Tailoring Rules pursuant to the amendments to the DoddFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 Dodd Frank introduced by the Economic Growth Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act The Tailoring Rules assign each US bank holding company with 100 billion or more in total consolidated assets as well as its bank subsidiaries to one of four categories based on its status as a US global systemically important banking organization and five other riskbased indicators i size ii crossjurisdictional activity iii nonbank assets iv offbalance sheet exposure and v weighted shortterm wholesale funding Under the Tailoring Rules the Company and pursuant to the Tailoring Rules its depository institution subsidiary AENB is subject to Category IV standards As a Category IV firm the Company is among other things i no longer subject to the advanced approaches capital requirements ii no longer subject to the supplementary leverage ratio SLR iii no longer subject to the countercyclical capital buffer iv no longer subject to companyrun stress testing requirements v subject to supervisory stress testing on an everyotheryear basis rather than an annual basis and vi no longer subject to the requirement to prepare and submit a holding companylevel resolution plan In addition as a Category IV firm with less than 50 billion in weighted shortterm wholesale funding the Company is no longer subject to the liquidity coverage ratio LCR Because a firms categorization under the Tailoring Rules is determined by and can change over time dependent upon how the firm measures against the riskbased indicator thresholds we are required to monitor and periodically report these riskbased indicators and there can be no assurance that the Company will continue to be a Category IV firm in the future Stress Testing and Capital Planning Under the Federal Reserves regulations the Company is subject to supervisory stress testing requirements that are designed to evaluate whether a bank holding company has sufficient capital on a total consolidated basis to absorb losses and support operations under adverse economic conditions As a Category IV firm the Company will be subject to the Federal Reserves supervisory stress tests every other year beginning in 2020 rather than on an annual cycle We remain subject to the requirement to develop and submit to the Federal Reserve an annual capital plan The Federal Reserve has stated it plans to propose changes which would include providing firms subject to Category IV standards additional flexibility to develop their capital plans As part of the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review CCAR the Federal Reserve evaluates whether the Company has sufficient capital to continue operations by assessing our proforma capital position and ratios under a scenario of economic and financial market stress Sufficient capital for these purposes is likely to require us to maintain capital ratios appreciably above applicable minimum requirements and buffers The Federal Reserve is expected to publish the decisions for all the bank holding companies participating in CCAR including the reasons for any objection to capital plans by June 30 In addition the Federal Reserve will publish separately the results of its supervisory stress test under the supervisory severely adverse scenario The information to be released will include among other things the Federal Reserves projection of companyspecific information including poststress capital ratio information over the planning horizon We may be required to revise and resubmit our capital plan as required by the Federal Reserve following certain events such as a significant acquisition In addition to other limitations our ability to make any capital distributions including dividends and share repurchases is contingent on the Federal Reserves nonobjection to our capital plan Dividends and Other Capital Distributions The Company and TRS as well as AENB and the Companys insurance and other regulated subsidiaries are limited in their ability to pay dividends by statutes regulations and supervisory policy Dividend payments by the Company to shareholders are subject to the oversight of the Federal Reserve See Stress Testing and Capital Planning Even if the Federal Reserve has not objected to a distribution the Company may still not make a distribution 7 Table of Contents without Federal Reserve approval if among other things the Company would not meet a minimum regulatory capital ratio after giving effect to the capital distribution changes in facts would require resubmission of our capital plan or the Companys earnings are materially underperforming its projections in the capital plan In general federal laws and regulations prohibit without first obtaining the OCCs approval AENB from making dividend distributions to TRS if such distributions are not paid out of available recent earnings or would cause AENB to fail to meet capital adequacy standards In addition to specific limitations on the dividends AENB can pay to TRS federal banking regulators have authority to prohibit or limit the payment of a dividend if in the banking regulators opinion payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the institution Capital Leverage and Liquidity Regulation Capital Rules The Company and AENB are required to comply with the applicable capital adequacy rules established by federal banking regulators These rules are intended to ensure that bank holding companies and depository institutions collectively banking organizations have adequate capital given their level of assets and offbalance sheet obligations The federal banking regulators current capital rules the Capital Rules implement the Basel Committee on Banking Supervisions the Basel Committee framework for strengthening international capital regulation known as Basel III For additional information regarding our capital ratios see Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity under MDA Under the Capital Rules banking organizations are required to maintain minimum ratios for Common Equity Tier 1 CET1 Tier 1 capital that is CET1 plus additional Tier 1 capital and Total capital that is Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital to riskweighted assets Since 2014 we have reported our capital adequacy ratios on a parallel basis to federal banking regulators using both riskweighted assets calculated under the Basel III standardized approach as adjusted for certain items and the requirements for an advanced approaches institution As a Category IV firm we are no longer subject to the Basel III advanced approaches capital requirements In December 2017 the Basel Committee published standards that among other things revise the standardized approach for credit risk including by recalibrating risk weights and introducing additional capital requirements for certain unconditionally cancellable commitments such as unused credit card lines of credit and provide a new standardized calculation for operational risk capital requirements If adopted in the United States as issued by the Basel Committee and applicable to us the new standards could result in higher capital requirements for us The Company and AENB must each maintain CET1 Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios of at least 45 percent 60 percent and 80 percent respectively The Capital Rules also implement a 25 percent capital conservation buffer composed entirely of CET1 on top of these minimum riskweighted asset ratios As a result the minimum ratios are effectively 70 percent 85 percent and 105 percent for the CET1 Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios respectively Federal banking regulators may further increase required minimum capital ratios by a countercyclical capital buffer composed entirely of CET1 up to 25 percent if they determine that such a buffer is necessary to protect the banking system from disorderly downturns associated with excessively expansionary periods Under the Tailoring Rules Category IV firms such as the Company would not be subject to such a countercyclical capital buffer Banking institutions whose ratio of CET1 Tier 1 Capital or Total capital to riskweighted assets is above the minimum but below the capital conservation buffer will face constraints on discretionary distributions such as dividends repurchases and redemptions of capital securities and executive compensation based on the amount of the shortfall and the institutions eligible retained income that is four quarter trailing net income net of distributions and tax effects not reflected in net income The Federal Reserve proposed a rule in April 2018 that would among other things replace the static 25 percent capital conservation buffer with a stress capital buffer requirement for bank holding companies subject to the CCAR process The stress capital buffer would reflect stressed losses in the supervisory severely adverse scenario of the Federal Reserves CCAR stress tests and would also include four quarters of planned common stock dividends The proposal also included a stress leverage buffer requirement similar to the stress capital buffer which would apply to the Tier 1 leverage ratio The proposal would require bank holding companies to reduce their planned capital distributions if those distributions would not be consistent with the applicable capital buffer constraints based on the bank holding companies own baseline scenario projections The Federal Reserve has indicated that it intends to propose revisions to the stress buffer requirements that would be applicable to Category IV firms such as the Company to align with the twoyear supervisory stresstesting cycle for Category IV bank holding companies 8 Table of Contents Leverage Requirements We are also required to comply with minimum leverage ratio requirements The leverage ratio is the ratio of a banking organizations Tier 1 capital to its average total consolidated assets as defined for regulatory purposes All banking organizations are required to maintain a leverage ratio of at least 40 percent The Capital Rules also establish an SLR requirement for advanced approaches banking organizations The SLR is the ratio of Tier 1 capital to an expanded concept of leverage exposure that includes both onbalance sheet and certain offbalance sheet exposures The Capital Rules require a minimum SLR of 30 percent As noted above Category IV firms such as the Company are not subject to the SLR requirement under the Tailoring Rules Liquidity Regulation The Federal Reserves enhanced prudential standards rule includes heightened liquidity and overall risk management requirements The rule requires the maintenance of a liquidity buffer consisting of highly liquid assets that is sufficient to meet projected net outflows for 30 days over a range of liquidity stress scenarios and a minimum LCR that measures a firms highquality liquid assets to its projected net outflows Under the Tailoring Rules Category IV firms with less than 50 billion in weighted shortterm wholesale funding such as the Company are no longer subject to any LCR requirement A second standard provided for in the Basel III liquidity framework referred to as the net stable funding ratio NSFR requires a minimum amount of longerterm funding based on the assets and activities of banking entities Although the NSFR has not been finalized the Federal Reserve staffs memorandum has indicated it will be applied in a manner consistent with the application of the LCR under the Tailoring Rules provided a Category IV firms weighted shortterm wholesale funding remains below 50 billion Prompt Corrective Action The Federal Deposit Insurance Act FDIA requires among other things that federal banking regulators take prompt corrective action in respect of depository institutions insured by the FDIC such as AENB that do not meet minimum capital requirements The FDIA establishes five capital categories for FDICinsured banks well capitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized The FDIA imposes progressively more restrictive constraints on operations management and capital distributions depending on the capital category in which an institution is classified In order to be considered well capitalized AENB must maintain CET1 Tier 1 capital Total capital and Tier 1 leverage ratios of 65 percent 80 percent 100 percent and 50 percent respectively Under the FDIA AENB could be prohibited from accepting brokered deposits ie deposits raised through thirdparty brokerage networks or offering interest rates on any deposits significantly higher than the prevailing rate in its normal market area or nationally depending upon where the deposits are solicited unless 1 it is well capitalized or 2 it is adequately capitalized and receives a waiver from the FDIC A significant amount of our outstanding US retail deposits are considered brokered deposits for bank regulatory purposes If a federal regulator determines that we are in an unsafe or unsound condition or that we are engaging in unsafe or unsound banking practices the regulator may reclassify our capital category or otherwise place restrictions on our ability to accept or solicit brokered deposits In December 2019 the FDIC issued a proposed rule intended to update and modernize the FDICs brokered deposit regulations The proposed rule among other things would revise the definition of deposit broker and the accompanying exceptions Resolution Planning Pursuant to Dodd Frank certain bank holding companies are required to submit resolution plans to the Federal Reserve and FDIC providing for the companys strategy for rapid and orderly resolution in the event of its material financial distress or failure However in connection with the release of the Tailoring Rules the Federal Reserve and FDIC finalized rules in October 2019 which among other things adjust the review cycles and applicability of the agencies resolution planning requirements Under these new rules Category IV firms such as the Company are no longer required to submit a holding company resolution plan AENB continues to be required to prepare and provide a separate resolution plan to the FDIC that would enable the FDIC as receiver to effectively resolve AENB under the FDIA in the event of failure The FDIC has issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on potential revisions to this separate resolution plan requirement for insured depository institutions and the next round of insured depository institution resolution plan submissions will not be required until the rulemaking process is complete 9 Table of Contents Orderly Liquidation Authority The Company could become subject to the Orderly Liquidation Authority OLA a resolution regime under which the Treasury Secretary may appoint the FDIC as receiver to liquidate a systemically important financial institution if the Company is in danger of default and is determined to present a systemic risk to US financial stability As under the FDIC resolution model under the OLA the FDIC has broad power as receiver Substantial differences exist however between the OLA and the FDIC resolution model for depository institutions including the right of the FDIC under the OLA to disregard the strict priority of creditor claims in limited circumstances the use of an administrative claims procedure to determine creditor claims as opposed to the judicial procedure used in bankruptcy proceedings and the right of the FDIC to transfer claims to a bridge entity The FDIC has developed a strategy under OLA referred to as the single point of entry or SPOE strategy under which the FDIC would resolve a failed financial holding company by transferring its assets including shares of its operating subsidiaries and potentially very limited liabilities to a bridge holding company utilize the resources of the failed financial holding company to recapitalize the operating subsidiaries and satisfy the claims of unsecured creditors of the failed financial holding company and other claimants in the receivership by delivering securities of one or more new financial companies that would emerge from the bridge holding company Under this strategy management of the failed financial holding company would be replaced and its shareholders and creditors would bear the losses resulting from the failure FDIC Powers upon Insolvency of AENB If the FDIC is appointed the conservator or receiver of AENB the FDIC has the power 1 to transfer any of AENBs assets and liabilities to a new obligor without the approval of AENBs creditors 2 to enforce the terms of AENBs contracts pursuant to their terms or 3 to repudiate or disaffirm any contract or lease to which AENB is a party the performance of which is determined by the FDIC to be burdensome and the disaffirmation or repudiation of which is determined by the FDIC to promote the orderly administration of AENB In addition the claims of holders of US deposit liabilities and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC against AENB would be afforded priority over other general unsecured claims against AENB including claims of debt holders and depositors in nonUS offices in the liquidation or other resolution of AENB As a result whether or not the FDIC ever sought to repudiate any debt obligations of AENB the debt holders and depositors in nonUS offices would be treated differently from and could receive substantially less if anything than the depositors in the US offices of AENB Other Banking Regulations Source of Strength The Company is required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to its US bank subsidiary AENB and may be required to commit capital and financial resources to support AENB Such support may be required at times when absent this requirement the Company otherwise might determine not to provide it Capital loans by the Company to AENB are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of AENB In the event of the Companys bankruptcy any commitment by the Company to a federal banking regulator to maintain the capital of AENB will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment Transactions Between AENB and its Affiliates Certain transactions including loans and credit extensions from AENB between AENB and its affiliates including the Company TRS and their other subsidiaries are subject to quantitative and qualitative limitations collateral requirements and other restrictions imposed by statute and regulation Transactions subject to these restrictions are generally required to be made on an armslength basis FDIC Deposit Insurance and Insurance Assessments AENB accepts deposits that are insured by the FDIC up to the applicable limits Under the FDIA the FDIC may terminate the insurance of an institutions deposits upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law regulation rule order or condition imposed by the FDIC We do not know of any practice condition or violation that might lead to termination of deposit insurance at AENB The FDICs deposit insurance fund is funded by assessments on insured depository institutions including AENB which are subject to adjustment by the FDIC 10 Table of Contents Community Reinvestment Act AENB is subject to the CRA which imposes affirmative ongoing obligations on depository institutions to meet the credit needs of their local communities including low and moderateincome neighborhoods consistent with the safe and sound operation of the institution In December 2019 the OCC and FDIC issued a notice of proposed rulemaking intended to i clarify which activities qualify for CRA credit ii update where activities count for CRA credit and iii change the methods for CRA measurement data collection recordkeeping and reporting Consumer Financial Products Regulation In the United States our marketing sale and servicing of consumer financial products and our compliance with certain federal consumer financial laws are supervised and examined by the CFPB which has broad rulemaking and enforcement authority over providers of credit savings and payment services and products and authority to prevent unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices In addition a number of US states have significant consumer credit protection disclosure and other laws in certain cases more stringent than US federal laws US federal law also regulates abusive debt collection practices which along with bankruptcy and debtor relief laws can affect our ability to collect amounts owed to us or subject us to regulatory scrutiny On May 7 2019 the CFPB issued proposed rules that would set forth additional requirements for thirdparty debt collection agencies which we use in the ordinary course of business This proposal is not expected to result in final rules if any becoming effective before 2021 We are also regulated in the United States under the money transmitter or sale of check laws in effect in most states In addition we are required by the laws of many states to comply with unclaimed and abandoned property laws under which we must pay to states the face amount of any Travelers Cheque or prepaid card that is uncashed or unredeemed after a period of time depending on the type of product In countries outside the United States regulators continue to focus on a number of key areas impacting our cardissuing businesses particularly consumer protection such as in the European Union EU the United Kingdom and Canada and responsible lending such as in Australia Mexico New Zealand and Singapore with increasing importance on and attention to customers and outcomes rather than just ensuring compliance with local rules and regulations Regulators expectations of firms in relation to their compliance risk and control frameworks continue to increase and regulators are placing significant emphasis on a firms systems and controls relating to the identification and resolution of issues Payments Regulation Legislators and regulators in various countries in which we operate have focused on the operation of card networks including through antitrust actions legislation and regulations to change certain practices or pricing of card issuers merchant acquirers and payment networks and in some cases to establish broad and ongoing regulatory oversight regimes for payment systems The EU Australia and other jurisdictions have focused on interchange fees that is the fee paid by the bankcard merchant acquirer to the card issuer in payment networks like Visa and Mastercard as well as the rules contract terms and practices governing merchant card acceptance For example in April 2019 the European Commission accepted commitments by Visa and Mastercard to significantly reduce interregional multilateral interchange fees Regulation and other governmental actions relating to pricing or practices could affect all networks directly or indirectly as well as adversely impact consumers and merchants Among other things regulation of bankcard fees has negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact the discount revenue we earn including as a result of downward pressure on our discount rate from decreases in competitor pricing in connection with caps on interchange fees In some cases regulations also extend to certain aspects of our business such as network and cobrand arrangements or the terms of card acceptance for merchants and we have largely exited our network businesses in the EU and Australia as a result of regulation in those jurisdictions for example In various countries such as certain Member States in the EU and Australia merchants are permitted by law to surcharge card purchases In addition the laws of a number of states in the United States that prohibit surcharging have been challenged in litigation brought by merchant groups and some such laws have been overturned Surcharging is an adverse customer experience and could have a material adverse effect on us if it becomes widespread particularly where it only or disproportionately impacts our business In addition other steering practices that are permitted by regulation in some countries could also have a material adverse effect on us if they become widespread See  Surcharging or steering by merchants could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations  under Risk Factors 11 Table of Contents In Canada regulators have prompted the major international card networks to make voluntary commitments on pricing specifically interchange fee levels as American Express does not operate with interchange fees in Canada our commitments extend to maintaining current pricing practices and complying with certain other practices In some countries governments have established regulatory regimes that require international card networks to be locally licensed andor to localize aspects of their operations For example the Reserve Bank of India which has broad power under the Payment and Settlement Systems Act 2007 to regulate the membership and operations of card networks has issued a mandate requiring payment systems operators in India to store certain payments data locally The development and enforcement of payment system regulatory regimes generally continue to grow and may adversely affect our ability to compete effectively and maintain and extend our global network Governments in some countries also provide resources or protection to select domestic payment card networks The Peoples Bank of China officially accepted our application for a business operating license to process domestic currency transactions through a joint venture in mainland China There can be no assurance that we will receive such a license or if we do that we will be able to successfully compete in China with domestic payment card networks and alternative payment providers Privacy Data Protection Information and Cyber Security Regulatory and legislative activity in the areas of privacy data protection and information and cyber security continues to increase worldwide We have established and continue to maintain policies and a governance framework to comply with applicable privacy data protection and information and cyber security laws meet evolving customer expectations and support and enable business innovation and growth Our regulators are increasingly focused on ensuring that our privacy data protection and information and cyber securityrelated policies and practices are adequate to inform customers of our data collection use sharing andor security practices to provide them with choices if required about how we use and share their information and to appropriately safeguard their personal information and account access Regulators are also focused on the policies and practices of our thirdparty vendors that may have access to our customer data or other information In the United States certain of our businesses are subject to the privacy disclosure and safeguarding provisions of the GrammLeachBliley Act GLBA and its implementing regulations and guidance Among other things GLBA imposes certain limitations on our ability to share consumers nonpublic personal information with nonaffiliated third parties and requires us to develop implement and maintain a written comprehensive information security program containing safeguards that are appropriate to the size and complexity of our business the nature and scope of our activities and the sensitivity of customer information that we process Effective January 2020 the California Consumer Privacy Act requires us to offer expanded privacy rights to California residents who are not covered by GLBA Various regulators US states and territories are considering similar requirements or have adopted laws rules and regulations pertaining to privacy andor information and cyber security that may be more stringent andor expansive than federal requirements We are also subject to certain privacy data protection and information and cyber security laws in other countries in which we operate including countries in the EU Australia Canada Japan Hong Kong India Mexico Singapore and the United Kingdom some of which are more stringent andor expansive than those in the United States Some countries have also instituted laws requiring incountry data processing andor incountry storage of data Compliance with such laws could result in higher technology administrative and other costs for us could limit our ability to optimize the use of our closedloop data and could require use of local technology services Some of these laws also require us to provide foreign governments broader access to our proprietary data and intellectual property Data breach notification laws or regulatory activities to encourage breach notification are also becoming more prevalent in jurisdictions outside the United States in which we operate In Europe the EU General Data Protection Regulation GDPR went into effect in May 2018 with significant fines for noncompliance up to 4 percent of total annual worldwide revenue It created additional legal and compliance obligations on companies that process personal data of individuals in the EU irrespective of the geographical location of the company We have made changes to our privacy practices to comply with these requirements and continue to rely on our binding corporate rules as the primary method for lawfully transferring data from our European affiliates to our affiliates in the United States and elsewhere globally The GDPR includes among other things a requirement for prompt notice of data breaches in certain circumstances to affected individuals and supervisory authorities In addition the European Directive 200258EC the ePrivacy Directive will continue to set out requirements for the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector until the approval of the forthcoming ePrivacy Regulation The ePrivacy Directive places restrictions on among other things the sending of unsolicited marketing communications as well as on the collection and use of data about internet users 12 Table of Contents The European Central Bank and the European Banking Authority have enacted secondary legislation focused on security breaches outsourcing strong customer authentication and information securityrelated policies Likewise a network and information security directive has been implemented into national laws by Member States in the EU The Revised Payment Services Directive PSD2 also contains regulatory requirements on strong customer authentication open access to customer data and payment capabilities and measures to prevent security incidents AntiMoney Laundering Sanctions and AntiCorruption Compliance We are subject to significant supervision and regulation and an increasingly stringent enforcement environment with respect to compliance with antimoney laundering AML sanctions and anticorruption laws and regulations in the United States and in other jurisdictions in which we operate Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs and policies and procedures for AML sanctions and anticorruption compliance could have serious financial legal and reputational consequences AntiMoney Laundering American Express is subject to a significant number of AML laws and regulations as a result of being a financial company headquartered in the United States as well as having a global presence In the United States the majority of AML requirements are derived from the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act and the accompanying regulations issued by the US Department of the Treasury collectively referred to as the Bank Secrecy Act as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 the Patriot Act In Europe AML requirements are largely the result of countries transposing the 4th EU AntiMoney Laundering Directive and preceding EU AntiMoney Laundering Directives into local laws and regulations EU Member States are required to implement the 5th and 6th EU AntiMoney Laundering Directives by January 10 2020 and December 3 2020 respectively Numerous other countries such as Argentina Australia Canada India Mexico New Zealand and Russia have also enacted or proposed new or enhanced AML legislation and regulations applicable to American Express Among other things these laws and regulations require us to establish AML programs that meet certain standards including in some instances expanded reporting particularly in the area of suspicious transactions and enhanced information gathering and recordkeeping requirements Any errors failures or delays in complying with federal state or foreign AML and counterterrorist financing laws could result in significant criminal and civil lawsuits penalties and forfeiture of significant assets or other enforcement actions Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation The United States has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries nationals and others The United States prohibits US persons from engaging with individuals and entities identified as Specially Designated Nationals such as terrorists and narcotics traffickers These prohibitions are administered by the US Department of the Treasurys Office of Foreign Assets Control OFAC and are typically known as the OFAC rules The OFAC rules prohibit US persons from engaging in financial transactions with or relating to the prohibited individual entity or country require the blocking of assets in which the individual entity or country has an interest and prohibit transfers of property subject to US jurisdiction including property in the possession or control of US persons to such individual entity or country Blocked assets eg property or bank deposits cannot be paid out withdrawn set off or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC We maintain a global sanctions program designed to ensure compliance with OFAC requirements Failure to comply with such requirements could subject us to serious legal and reputational consequences including criminal penalties Pursuant to Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 which added Section 13r to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended the Exchange Act an issuer is required to disclose in its annual or quarterly reports as applicable whether it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities transactions or dealings relating to Iran or with individuals or entities designated pursuant to certain Executive Orders Disclosure is generally required even where the activities transactions or dealings were conducted outside the United States by nonUS affiliates in compliance with applicable law and whether or not the activities are sanctionable under US law American Express Global Business Travel GBT and certain entities that may be considered affiliates of GBT have informed us that during the year ended December 31 2019 approximately 30 visas were obtained from Iranian embassies and consulates around the world in connection with certain travel arrangements on behalf of clients and reservations were booked at one hotel that may be owned directly or indirectly or may otherwise be affiliated with the Government of Iran GBT had negligible gross revenues and net profits attributable to these transactions and intends to continue to engage in these activities on a limited basis so long as such activities are permitted under US law 13 Table of Contents AntiCorruption We are subject to complex international and US anticorruption laws and regulations including the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act the FCPA the UK Bribery Act and other laws that prohibit the making or offering of improper payments The FCPA makes it illegal to corruptly offer or provide anything of value to foreign government officials political parties or political party officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or an improper advantage The FCPA also requires us to strictly comply with certain accounting and internal controls standards In recent years enforcement of the FCPA has become more intense The UK Bribery Act also prohibits commercial bribery and the receipt of a bribe and makes it a corporate offense to fail to prevent bribery by an associated person in addition to prohibiting improper payments to foreign government officials Failure of the Company our subsidiaries colleagues contractors or agents to comply with the FCPA the UK Bribery Act and other laws can expose us andor individual colleagues to investigation prosecution and potentially severe criminal and civil penalties Compensation Practices Our compensation practices are subject to oversight by the Federal Reserve The federal banking regulators guidance on sound incentive compensation practices sets forth three key principles for incentive compensation arrangements that are designed to help ensure that incentive compensation plans do not encourage imprudent risktaking and are consistent with the safety and soundness of banking organizations The three principles provide that a banking organizations incentive compensation arrangements should 1 provide incentives that appropriately balance risk and financial results in a manner that does not encourage employees to expose their organizations to imprudent risks 2 be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management and 3 be supported by strong corporate governance including active and effective oversight by the organizations board of directors Any deficiencies in our compensation practices that are identified by the Federal Reserve or other banking regulators in connection with its review of our compensation practices may be incorporated into our supervisory ratings which can affect our ability to make acquisitions or perform other actions Enforcement actions may be taken against us if our incentive compensation arrangements or related riskmanagement control or governance processes are determined to pose a risk to our safety and soundness and we have not taken prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies In May 2016 the federal banking regulators the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC the Federal Housing Finance Agency and the National Credit Union Administration reproposed a rule originally proposed in 2011 on incentivebased compensation practices The reproposed rule would apply deferral downward adjustment and forfeiture and clawback requirements to incentivebased compensation arrangements granted to senior executive officers and significant risktakers of covered institutions with specific requirements varying based on the asset size of the covered institution and the category of employee If these or other regulations are adopted in a form similar to what has been proposed they will impose limitations on the manner in which we may structure compensation for our colleagues which could adversely affect our ability to hire retain and motivate key colleagues 14 Table of Contents INFORMATION ABOUT OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS Set forth

available free of charge on or through this website our annual quarterly and current reports and any amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable following the time they are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC In addition we routinely post financial and other information some of which could be material to investors on our Investor Relations website Information regarding our corporate responsibility and sustainability initiatives are available on our Corporate Responsibility website at httpaboutamericanexpresscomcorporateresponsibility The content of any of our websites referred to in this report is not incorporated by reference into this report or any other report filed with or furnished to the SEC We have included such website addresses only as inactive textual references and do not intend them to be active links You can find certain statistical disclosures required of bank holding companies starting on page A1 which are incorporated herein by reference Our business as a whole has not experienced significant seasonal fluctuations although card billed business tends to be moderately higher in the fourth quarter than in other quarters As a result the amount of Card Member loans and receivables outstanding tend to be moderately higher during that quarter The average discount rate also tends to be slightly lower during the fourth quarter due to a higher level of retailrelated billed business volumes ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS This section highlights specific risks that could affect us and our businesses broadly categorized as Strategic Business and Competitive Risks Legal Regulatory and Compliance Risks and Credit Liquidity and Market Risks You should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10K including the Risk Management section under MDA which describes our approach to identifying monitoring and managing the risks we assume in conducting our businesses and provides certain quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks Based on the information currently known to us we believe the following information identifies the most significant risk factors affecting us However the risks and uncertainties we face are not limited to those described below Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business If any of the following risks develop into actual events or if the circumstances described in the risks occur or continue to occur these events or circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations These events or circumstances could also have a negative effect on the trading price of our securities Strategic  Business and Competitive Risks Difficult conditions in the business and economic environment as well as political conditions in the United States and elsewhere may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations Our results of operations are materially affected by economic market political and social conditions in the United States and abroad We offer a broad array of products and services to consumers small businesses and commercial clients and thus are very dependent upon the level of consumer and business activity and the demand for payment and financing products Slow economic growth volatile or deteriorating economic conditions or shifts in broader consumer and business trends significantly impact customer behaviors including spending on our cards the ability and willingness of Card Members to borrow and pay amounts owed to us and demand for feebased products and services Political conditions prolonged or recurring government shutdowns regional hostilities and the prospect or occurrence of more widespread conflicts social upheaval fiscal and monetary policies trade wars and tariffs could also negatively affect consumer and business spending including travel patterns and business investment and demand for credit Factors such as consumer spending and confidence unemployment rates business investment geopolitical instability election results government spending trade relationships with other countries interest rates taxes energy costs the volatility and strength of the capital markets inflation and deflation all affect the economic environment and ultimately our profitability Such factors may also cause our earnings billings loan balances credit metrics and margins to fluctuate and diverge from expectations of analysts and investors who may have differing assumptions regarding their impact on our business adversely affecting andor increasing the volatility of the trading price of our common shares 17 Table of Contents Travel and entertainment expenditures which comprised approximately 25 percent of our US billed business during 2019 for example are sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending levels and tend to decline during general economic downturns Likewise spending by small businesses and corporate clients which comprised approximately 41 percent of our worldwide billed business during 2019 depends in part on the economic environment and a favorable climate for continued business investment and new business formation Increases in delinquencies and writeoff rates as a result of increases in bankruptcies unemployment rates changes in customer behaviors or otherwise could also have a material adverse effect on our results of operations The consequences of negative circumstances impacting us or the environment generally can be sudden and severe Our business is subject to the effects of geopolitical events weather natural disasters and other conditions Geopolitical events terrorist attacks natural disasters severe weather conditions floods health pandemics including the recent coronavirus outbreak information or cyber security incidents including intrusion into or degradation of systems or technology by cyberattackers and other catastrophic events can have a material adverse effect on our business Because of our proximity to the World Trade Center our headquarters were damaged as a result of the terrorist attacks of September 11 2001 Recent hurricanes and other natural disasters have impacted spending and credit performance in the areas affected Similar events or other disasters or catastrophic events in the future and events impacting other sectors of the economy including the telecommunications and energy sectors could have a negative effect on our businesses and infrastructure including our technology and systems Climate change may exacerbate certain of these threats including the frequency and severity of weatherrelated events Card Members in California New York Florida Texas Georgia and New Jersey account for a significant portion of US Consumer billed business and Card Members loans and our results of operations could be impacted by events or conditions that disproportionately or specifically affect one or more of those states Because we derive a portion of our revenues from travelrelated spending our business is sensitive to safety concerns related to travel and tourism limitations on travel and mobility and healthrelated risks including travel restrictions and bans as a result of the recent coronavirus outbreak In addition disruptions in air travel and other forms of travel can result in the payment of claims under travel interruption insurance policies we offer and if such disruptions to travel are prolonged they can materially adversely affect overall travelrelated spending If the conditions described above or similar ones result in widespread or lengthy disruptions to travel they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations Card Member spending may also be negatively impacted in areas affected by natural disasters or other catastrophic events The impact of such events on the overall economy may also adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations The exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union could materially adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition Our business in the United Kingdom and elsewhere may be negatively impacted by the exit of the United Kingdom from the EU commonly referred to as Brexit on January 31 2020 including from a deterioration of the economic environment in the United Kingdom and other countries in which we operate that adversely affects spending on our cards and the ability and willingness of Card Members to pay amounts owed to us We may also experience increased volatility in the value of the pound sterling the euro and other European currencies which could further strengthen the US dollar adversely impacting the results of operations from our international activities In addition Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations in the United Kingdom and the EU and we may incur additional costs or need to make operational changes that reduce revenue as we adapt to potentially divergent regulatory frameworks Any of these effects of Brexit among others could adversely affect our business and financial results As of December 31 2019 the United Kingdom constituted approximately 4 percent of our worldwide billed business and the EMEA region as a whole constituted approximately 11 percent We have made changes to the structure of our business operations in Europe in anticipation of Brexit although the financial trade and legal implications of Brexit remain uncertain and may be more severe than expected given the lack of comparable precedent Our operating results may materially suffer because of substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the payments industry The payments industry is highly competitive and we compete with card networks issuers and acquirers paperbased transactions eg cash and checks bank transfer models eg wire transfers and ACH as well as evolving and growing alternative nontraditional payment and financing providers If we are not able to differentiate ourselves from our competitors develop compelling value propositions for our customers andor effectively grow in areas such as mobile and online payments and emerging technologies we may not be able to compete effectively 18 Table of Contents We believe Visa and Mastercard are larger than we are in most countries As a result card issuers and acquirers on the Visa and Mastercard networks may be able to benefit from the dominant position scale resources marketing and pricing of those networks Our business may also be increasingly negatively affected if we are unable to increase or maintain merchant acceptance and our cards are not accepted at merchants that accept cards on the Visa and Mastercard networks Some of our competitors have developed or may develop substantially greater financial and other resources than we have and may offer richer value propositions or a wider range of programs and services than we offer or may use more effective advertising marketing or crossselling strategies to acquire and retain more customers capture a greater share of spending and borrowings establish and develop more attractive cobrand card and other partner programs and maintain greater merchant acceptance than we have We may not be able to compete effectively against these threats or respond or adapt to changes in consumer spending habits as effectively as our competitors Expenses such as Card Member rewards and Card Member services expenses could continue to increase as we improve our value propositions for Card Members including in response to increased competition Spending on our cards could continue to be impacted by increasing consumer usage of charge credit and debit cards issued on other networks as well as adoption of alternative payment systems The fragmentation of customer spending to take advantage of different merchant or card incentives or for convenience with technological solutions may continue to increase To the extent other payment mechanisms systems and products continue to successfully expand our discount revenues and our ability to access transaction data through our integrated payments platform could be negatively impacted For example companies that control access to consumer and merchant payment method choices at the point of sale or through digital wallets commercerelated experiences mobile applications or other technologies could choose not to accept suppress use of or degrade the experience of using our products or could restrict our access to our customers and transaction data Such companies could also require payments from us to participate in such digital wallets experiences or applications impacting our profitability on transactions The competitive value of our closedloop data may also be diminished as traditional and nontraditional competitors use other new data sources and technologies to derive similar insights Certain regulations such as PSD2 in Europe and open banking initiatives in various jurisdictions around the world could also diminish the value of our closedloop data or the demand for our products and services by disintermediating existing financial services providers To the extent we expand into new business areas and new geographic regions we may face competitors with more experience and more established relationships with relevant customers regulators and industry participants which could adversely affect our ability to compete Laws and business practices that favor local competitors require card transactions to be routed over domestic networks or prohibit or limit foreign ownership of certain businesses could limit our growth in international regions We may face additional compliance and regulatory risks to the extent that we expand into new business areas and we may need to dedicate more expense time and resources to comply with regulatory requirements than our competitors particularly those that are not regulated financial institutions Many of our competitors are subject to different and in some cases less stringent legislative and regulatory regimes and some may have lower cost structures and more agile business models and systems More restrictive laws and regulations that do not apply to all of our competitors can put us at a disadvantage including prohibiting us from engaging in certain transactions regulating our business practices or adversely affecting our cost structure We face intense competition for partner relationships which could result in a loss or renegotiation of these arrangements that could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations In the ordinary course of our business we enter into different types of contractual arrangements with business partners in a variety of industries For example we have partnered with Delta Marriott British Airways and Hilton as well as many others globally to offer cobranded cards for consumers and small businesses and through our Membership Rewards program we have partnered with businesses in many industries including Delta and others in the airline industry to offer benefits to Card Member participants See Business Partners and Relationships under Business for additional information on our business partnerships including with Delta Competition for relationships with key business partners is very intense and there can be no assurance we will be able to grow or maintain these partner relationships or that they will remain as profitable Establishing and retaining attractive cobrand card partnerships is particularly competitive among card issuers and networks as these partnerships typically appeal to highspending loyal customers All of our cobrand portfolios in the aggregate accounted for approximately 18 percent of our worldwide billed business for the year ended December 31 2019 Card Member loans related to our cobrand portfolios accounted for approximately 38 percent of our worldwide Card Member loans as of December 31 2019 19 Table of Contents Cobrand arrangements are entered into for a fixed period generally ranging from five to ten years and will terminate in accordance with their terms including at the end of the fixed period unless extended or renewed at the option of the parties or upon early termination as a result of an event of default or otherwise We work with our cobrand partners on an ongoing basis to demonstrate the value we deliver and evolve our relationships for the benefit of both parties We face the risk that we could lose partner relationships even after we have invested significant resources in the relationships We may also choose to not renew certain cobrand relationships The volume of billed business could decline and Card Member attrition could increase in each case significantly as a result of the termination of one or more cobrand partnership relationships In addition some of our cobrand arrangements provide that upon expiration or termination the cobrand partner may purchase or designate a third party to purchase the loans generated with respect to its program which could result in the loss of the card accounts and a significant decline in our Card Member loans outstanding We regularly seek to extend or renew cobrand arrangements in advance of the end of the contract term and face the risk that existing relationships will be renegotiated with less favorable terms for us or that we may be unable to renegotiate on terms that are acceptable to us as competition for such relationships continues to increase We make payments to our cobrand partners which can be significant based primarily on the amount of Card Member spending and corresponding rewards earned on such spending and under certain arrangements on the number of accounts acquired and retained The amount we pay to our cobrand partners has increased particularly in the United States and may continue to increase as arrangements are renegotiated due to increasingly intense competition for cobrand partners among card issuers and networks See OffBalance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations under MDA for additional information regarding commitments for payments to certain cobrand partners The loss of exclusivity arrangements with business partners the loss of the partner relationship altogether whether by nonrenewal at the end of the contract period such as the end of our relationship with Costco in the United States in 2016 or as the result of a merger legal or regulatory action or otherwise such as the withdrawal of American Airlines in 2014 from our Airport Club Access program for Centurion  and Platinum Card  Members or the renegotiation of existing partnerships with terms that are significantly worse for us could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations See Our business is subject to comprehensive government regulation and supervision which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition for information on the uncertainty regarding our cobrand and agent relationships in the EU In addition any publicity associated with the loss of any of our key business partners could harm our reputation making it more difficult to attract and retain Card Members and merchants and could weaken our negotiating position with our remaining and prospective business partners Arrangements with our business partners represent a significant portion of our business We are exposed to risks associated with our business partners including reputational issues business slowdowns bankruptcies liquidations restructurings and consolidations and the possible obligation to make payments to our partners Our success is in many ways dependent on the success of our business partners From customer acquisition to cobranding arrangements from participation in our rewards programs to facilitating B2B supplier payments for our corporate clients we rely on our business partners across many aspects of our company and our arrangements with business partners represent a significant portion of our business See Business Partners and Relationships under Business for additional information on our business partnerships To the extent any of our partners fail to effectively promote and support our products experience a slowdown in their business operational disruptions reputational issues or loss of consumer confidence or are otherwise unable to meet our expectations or those of their other stakeholders our business may be materially negatively impacted In addition we may be obligated to make or accelerate payments to certain business partners such as cobrand partners upon the occurrence of certain triggering events such as a shortfall in certain performance and revenue levels If we are not able to effectively manage these triggering events we could unexpectedly have to make payments to these partners which could have a negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations See Contractual Obligations under MDA for additional information on financial commitments related to agreements with certain cobrand partners Similarly we are exposed to risk from bankruptcies liquidations insolvencies financial distress restructurings consolidations and other similar events that may occur in any industry representing a significant portion of our billed business which could negatively impact particular card products and services and billed business generally and our financial condition and results of operations We could also be materially impacted if we were obligated or elected to reimburse Card Members for products and services purchased from merchants that have ceased operations or stopped accepting our cards For example we are exposed to credit risk in the airline industry to the extent we protect Card Members against nondelivery of goods and services such as where we have remitted payment to an airline for a Card Member purchase of tickets that have not yet been used or flown If we are unable to collect the amount from the airline we may bear the loss for the amount credited to the Card Member Spending at airline merchants accounted for approximately 8 percent of our worldwide billed business for the year ended December 31 2019 For additional information relating to the general risks related to the airline industry see Risk ManagementInstitutional Credit RiskExposure to the Airline and Travel Industry under MDA 20 Table of Contents We face continued intense competitive pressure that may materially impact the prices we charge merchants that accept our cards for payment for goods and services Unlike our competitors in the payments industry that rely on revolving credit balances to drive profits our business model is more focused on Card Member spending Discount revenue which represents fees generally charged to merchants when Card Members use their cards to purchase goods and services on our network is primarily driven by billed business volumes and is our largest single revenue source Our average merchant discount rate has been impacted by regulatory changes affecting competitor pricing in certain international countries We also face pressure from competitors that have other sources of income or lower costs that can make their pricing more attractive to business partners and merchants Merchants are also able to negotiate incentives and pricing concessions from us as a condition to accepting our cards or being cobrand partners As merchants consolidate and become even larger we may have to increase the amount of incentives andor concessions we provide to such merchants which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations Competitive and regulatory pressures on pricing could make it difficult to offset the costs of these incentives We have also experienced erosion of our average merchant discount rate as we increase merchant acceptance We may not be successful in significantly expanding merchant acceptance or offsetting rate erosion with volumes at new merchants In addition the regulatory environment and differentiated payment models and technologies from nontraditional players in the alternative payments space could pose challenges to our traditional payment model and adversely impact our average merchant discount rate Some merchants continue to invest in their own payment solutions such as proprietarybranded mobile wallets using both traditional and new technology platforms If merchants are able to drive broad consumer adoption and usage it could adversely impact our average merchant discount rate and billed business volumes A continuing priority of ours is to drive greater and differentiated value to our merchants which if not successful could negatively impact our discount revenue and financial results We may not succeed in maintaining merchant discount rates or offsetting the impact of declining merchant discount rates which could materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability and therefore our ability to invest in innovation and in valueadded services for merchants and Card Members Surcharging or steering by merchants could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations In certain countries such as Australia and certain Member States in the EU merchants are expressly permitted by law to surcharge certain card purchases In jurisdictions allowing surcharging we have seen merchant surcharging on American Express cards in certain merchant categories and in some cases either the surcharge is greater than that applied to Visa and Mastercard cards or Visa and Mastercard cards are not surcharged at all practices that are known as differential surcharging even though there are many cards issued on competing networks that have an equal or greater cost of acceptance for the merchant In addition the laws of a number of states in the United States that prohibit surcharging have been overturned in litigation brought by merchant groups We also encounter merchants that accept our cards but tell their customers that they prefer to accept another type of payment or otherwise seek to suppress use of our cards Our Card Members value the ability to use their cards where and when they want to and we therefore take steps to meet our Card Members expectations and to protect the American Express brand by prohibiting this form of discrimination subject to local legal requirements If surcharging steering or other forms of discrimination become widespread American Express cards and credit and charge cards generally could become less desirable to consumers which could result in a decrease in cardsinforce and transaction volumes The impact could vary depending on such factors as the industry or manner in which a surcharge is levied how Card Members are surcharged or steered to other card products or payment forms at the point of sale the ease and speed of implementation for merchants including as a result of new or emerging technologies the size and recurrence of the underlying charges and whether and to what extent these actions are applied to other forms of payment including whether it varies depending on the type of card eg credit or debit product network acquirer or issuer Discrimination against American Express cards could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations particularly to the extent it disproportionately impacts our Card Members or our business 21 Table of Contents We may not be successful in our efforts to promote card usage through marketing and promotion merchant acceptance and Card Member rewards and services or to effectively control the costs of such investments both of which may materially impact our profitability Revenue growth is dependent on increasing consumer and business spending on our cards growing loan balances and increasing fee revenue We have been investing in a number of growth initiatives including to attract new Card Members reduce Card Member attrition and capture a greater share of customers total spending and borrowings There can be no assurance that our investments to acquire Card Members provide differentiated features and services and increase usage of our cards will continue to be effective In addition if we develop new products or offers that attract customers looking for shortterm incentives rather than incentivize longterm loyalty Card Member attrition and costs could increase Increasing spending on our cards also depends on our continued expansion of merchant acceptance of our cards If we are unable to continue growing merchant acceptance or merchants decide to no longer accept American Express cards our business could suffer Further expanding our service offerings adding customer acquisition channels and forming new partnerships or renewing current partnerships could have higher costs than our current arrangements and could adversely impact our average discount rate or dilute our brand Another way we invest in customer value is through our Membership Rewards program as well as other Card Member benefits Any significant change in or failure by management to reasonably estimate actual redemptions of Membership Rewards points and associated redemption costs could adversely affect our profitability We rely on third parties for certain redemption options and may not be able to continue to offer such redemption options in the future which could diminish the value of the program for our Card Members Our two largest redemption partners are Amazon and Delta In addition many credit card issuers have instituted rewards and cobrand programs and may introduce programs and services that are similar to or more attractive than ours Our inability to continue to differentiate our products and services generally could materially adversely affect us We may not be able to costeffectively manage and expand Card Member benefits including containing the growth of marketing promotion rewards and Card Member services expenses in the future If such expenses increase beyond our expectations we will need to find ways to offset the financial impact by increasing payments volume increasing other areas of revenues such as feebased revenues or both We may not succeed in doing so particularly in the current competitive and regulatory environment Our brand and reputation are key assets of our Company and our business may be materially affected by how we are perceived in the marketplace Our brand and its attributes are key assets and we believe our continued success depends on our ability to preserve grow and leverage the value of our brand Our ability to attract and retain consumer and small business Card Members and corporate clients is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our level of service trustworthiness business practices data use and protection management workplace culture merchant acceptance financial condition our response to unexpected events and other subjective qualities Negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters  even if related to seemingly isolated incidents and whether or not factually correctcould erode trust and confidence and damage our reputation among existing and potential Card Members corporate clients merchants and partners which could make it difficult for us to attract new customers and maintain existing ones Negative public opinion could result from actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities or circumstances including card practices regulatory compliance the use and protection of customer information and conduct by our colleagues and from actions taken by regulators or others in response thereto Discussion about such matters in social media channels can also cause rapid widespread reputational harm to our brand Our brand and reputation may also be harmed by actions taken by third parties that are outside our control For example any shortcoming of or controversy related to a thirdparty vendor business partner merchant acquirer or network partner may be attributed by Card Members and merchants to us thus damaging our reputation and brand value The lack of acceptance suppression of card usage or surcharging by merchants can also negatively impact perceptions of our brand and our products lower overall transaction volume and increase the attractiveness of other payment products or systems Adverse developments with respect to our industry may also by association negatively impact our reputation or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny or litigation against us Furthermore as a corporation with headquarters and operations located in the United States a negative perception of the United States arising from its political or other positions could harm the perception of our company and our brand Although we monitor developments for areas of potential risk to our reputation and brand negative perceptions or publicity could materially and adversely affect our business volumes revenues and profitability 22 Table of Contents A major information or cyber security incident or an increase in fraudulent activity could lead to reputational damage to our brand and material legal regulatory and financial exposure and could reduce the use and acceptance of our charge and credit cards We and third parties process transmit store and provide access to account information in connection with our charge and credit cards and other products and in the normal course of our business we collect analyze and retain significant volumes of certain types of personally identifiable and other information pertaining to our customers and colleagues Our networks and systems are subject to constant attempts to identify and exploit potential vulnerabilities in our operating environment with intent to disrupt our business operations and capture destroy manipulate or expose various types of information relating to corporate trade secrets customer information including Card Member travel and loyalty program data colleague information and other sensitive business information including acquisition activity nonpublic financial results and intellectual property There are a number of motivations for cyber threat actors including criminal activities such as fraud identity theft and ransom corporate or nationstate espionage political agendas public embarrassment with the intent to cause financial or reputational harm intent to disrupt information technology systems and to expose and exploit potential security and privacy vulnerabilities in corporate systems and websites Global financial institutions like us as well as our customers colleagues regulators vendors and other third parties have experienced a significant increase in information and cyber security risk in recent years and will likely continue to be the target of increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks including computer viruses malicious or destructive code ransomware social engineering attacks including phishing impersonation and identity takeover attempts corporate espionage hacking website defacement denialofservice attacks and other attacks and similar disruptions from the misconfiguration or unauthorized use of or access to computer systems For example we and other US financial services providers have been the target of distributed denialofservice attacks from sophisticated third parties These threats can arise from external parties as well as insiders who knowingly or unknowingly engage in or enable malicious cyber activities We develop and maintain systems and processes aimed at detecting and preventing information and cyber security incidents and fraudulent activity which require significant investment maintenance and ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies and regulatory requirements change and as efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated Despite our efforts the possibility of information and cyber security incidents malicious social engineering corporate espionage fraudulent or other malicious activities and human error or malfeasance cannot be eliminated entirely and will evolve as new and emerging technology is deployed including the increasing use of personal mobile and computing devices that are outside of our network and control environments Risks associated with each of these include theft of funds and other monetary loss the disruption of our operations and the unauthorized disclosure release gathering monitoring misuse modification loss or destruction of confidential proprietary trade secret or other information including account data information the effects of which could be compounded if not detected quickly Indeed an information or cyber security incident may not be detected until well after it occurs and the severity and potential impact may not be fully known for a substantial period of time after it has been discovered Information or cyber security incidents fraudulent activity and other actual or perceived failures to maintain confidentiality integrity privacy andor security has led to increased regulatory scrutiny and may lead to regulatory investigations and intervention such as mandatory card reissuance increased litigation including class action litigation remediation fines and response costs negative assessments of us and our subsidiaries by banking regulators and rating agencies reputational and financial damage to our brand and reduced usage of our products and services all of which could have a material adverse impact on our business The disclosure of sensitive company information could also undermine our competitive advantage and divert management attention and resources Successful cyberattacks data breaches disruptions or other incidents related to the actual or perceived failures to maintain confidentiality integrity privacy andor security at other large financial institutions large retailers travel and hospitality companies government agencies or other market participants whether or not we are impacted could lead to a general loss of customer confidence that could negatively affect us including harming the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures or harming the reputation of the financial system in general which could result in reduced use of our products and services Such events could also result in legislation and additional regulatory requirements Although we maintain cyber insurance there can be no assurance that liabilities or losses we may incur will be covered under such policies or that the amount of insurance will be adequate 23 Table of Contents The uninterrupted operation of our information systems is critical to our success and a significant disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations Our information technology systems including our transaction authorization clearing and settlement systems and data centers may experience service disruptions or degradation because of technology malfunction sudden increases in customer transaction volume natural disasters accidents power outages internet outages telecommunications failures fraud denialofservice and other cyberattacks terrorism computer viruses vulnerabilities in hardware or software physical or electronic breakins or similar events Service disruptions or degradations could prevent access to our online services and account information compromise or limit access to company or customer data impede transaction processing and financial reporting and lead to regulatory investigations and fines increased regulatory oversight and litigation Any such service disruption or degradation could adversely affect the perception of the reliability of our products and services and materially adversely affect our overall business reputation and results of operations We rely on thirdparty providers for acquiring and servicing customers technology platforms and other services integral to the operations of our businesses These third parties may act in ways that could materially harm our business We rely on thirdparty service providers cobrand partners merchants customer acquisition channels processors aggregators network partners and other third parties for services that are integral to our operations and are subject to the risk that activities of such third parties may adversely affect our business As outsourcing specialization of functions thirdparty digital services and technology innovation within the payments industry increase including with respect to mobile technologies tokenization big data artificial intelligence and cloud storage solutions more third parties are involved in processing card transactions and handling our data For example we rely on third parties for the timely transmission of accurate information across our global network card acquisition and provision of services to our customers If a service provider or other third party ceases to provide the data quality or communications capacity we expect or services upon which we rely as a result of natural disaster operational disruptions or errors terrorism information or cyber security incidents or any other reason the failure could interrupt or compromise the quality of our services to customers or impact our ability to grow our business The confidentiality integrity privacy availability andor security of data communicated over thirdparty networks or platforms or held by or accessible to third parties including merchants that accept our cards payment processors payment intermediaries and our thirdparty vendors and business partners could become compromised which could lead to unauthorized use of our data or fraudulent transactions on our cards as well as costs associated with responding to such an incident including regulatory investigations and fines increased regulatory oversight and litigation For example in March 2018 we were alerted by Expedia that certain customers who used Expedias Orbitz platform may have been victims of a cyberattack The attack involved an Orbitz platform that served as the underlying booking engine for online travel websites including Amextravelcom and travel booked through Amex Travel Representatives We are also exposed to the risk that a disruption or other event at a third party affecting one of our service providers or partners could impede their ability to provide to us services or data on which we rely to operate our business Service providers or other third parties could also cease providing data to us or use our data in a way that diminishes the competitive value of our closed loop The management and oversight of multiple vendors increases our operational complexity and governance challenges and decreases our control A failure to exercise adequate oversight over service providers including compliance with service level agreements or regulatory or legal requirements could result in regulatory actions fines litigation sanctions or economic and reputational harm to us In addition we may not be able to effectively monitor or mitigate operational risks relating to our vendors service providers We are also exposed to the risk that a service disruption at a common service provider to our vendors could impede their ability to provide services to us Notwithstanding any attempts to diversify our reliance on third parties we may not be able to effectively mitigate operational risks relating to our vendors use of common service providers If we are not able to invest successfully in and compete at the leading edge of technological developments across all our businesses our revenue and profitability could be materially adversely affected Our industry is subject to rapid and significant technological changes In order to compete in our industry we need to continue to invest in technology across all areas of our business including in transaction processing data management and analytics machine learning and artificial intelligence customer interactions and communications open banking and alternative payment mechanisms authentication technologies and digital identification tokenization realtime settlement and risk management and compliance systems Incorporating new technologies into our products and services including developing the appropriate governance and controls consistent with regulatory expectations may require substantial expenditures and take considerable time and ultimately may not be successful We expect that new technologies in the payments industry will continue to emerge and these new technologies may be superior to or render obsolete our existing technology 24 Table of Contents The process of developing new products and services enhancing existing products and services and adapting to technological changes and evolving industry standards is complex costly and uncertain and any failure by us to anticipate customers changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly impede our ability to compete effectively Consumer and merchant adoption is a key competitive factor and our competitors may develop products platforms or technologies that become more widely adopted than ours In addition we may underestimate the time and expense we must invest in new products and services before they generate significant revenues if at all Our ability to develop acquire or access competitive technologies or business processes on acceptable terms may also be limited by intellectual property rights that third parties including competitors and potential competitors may assert In addition our ability to adopt new technologies may be inhibited by the emergence of industrywide standards a changing legislative and regulatory environment an inability to develop appropriate governance and controls a lack of internal product and engineering expertise resistance to change from Card Members or merchants or the complexity of our systems We may not be successful in realizing the benefits associated with our acquisitions strategic alliances joint ventures and investment activity and our business and reputation could be materially adversely affected We have acquired a number of businesses and have made a number of strategic investments and continue to evaluate potential transactions These transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully identify and secure future acquisition candidates on terms and conditions that are acceptable to us or successfully complete proposed acquisitions and investments which could impair our growth The process of integrating an acquired company business or technology could create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures result in unanticipated liabilities including legal claims violations of laws commercial disputes and information security vulnerabilities or breaches and harm our business generally It may take us longer than expected to fully realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions and those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all which could materially adversely affect our business and operating results including as a result of writedowns of goodwill and other intangible assets We may also face risks with other types of strategic transactions such as the sale to InComm of the operations relating to our prepaid reloadable and gift card business The reloadable operations have experienced disruptions in the past impacting the ability of our prepaid customers to load and use their cards If such operations are interrupted suspended or terminated in the future it could further negatively impact our customers experience result in additional costs litigation and regulatory action and harm our business and reputation Joint ventures including our GBT JV and our new joint venture in China and minority investments inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations thereby potentially increasing the financial legal operational andor compliance risks associated with the joint venture or minority investment In addition we may be dependent on joint venture partners controlling shareholders or management who may have business interests strategies or goals that are inconsistent with ours For example trade secrets and other proprietary information we may provide to a joint venture may become available to third parties beyond our control The ability to enforce intellectual property and contractual rights to prevent disclosure of our trade secrets and other proprietary information may be limited in certain jurisdictions Business decisions or other actions or omissions of the joint venture partner controlling shareholders or management may adversely affect the value of our investment result in litigation or regulatory action against us and otherwise damage our reputation and brand Our success is dependent on maintaining a culture of integrity and respect as well as upon our executive officers and other key personnel and misconduct by or loss of key personnel could materially adversely affect our business We rely upon our key personnel not only for business success but also to lead with integrity and promote a culture of respect To the extent our leaders behave in a manner that does not comport with our companys values the consequences to our brand and reputation could be severe and could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations The market for qualified individuals is highly competitive and we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel or candidates to replace or succeed members of our senior management team or other key personnel who voluntarily or involuntarily leave the company Changes in immigration and work permit laws and regulations or the administration or enforcement of such laws or regulations can also impair our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel or to employ such personnel in the locations of our choice As further described in Supervision and RegulationCompensation Practices our compensation practices are subject to review and oversight by the Federal Reserve and the compensation practices of AENB is subject to review and oversight by the OCC This regulatory review and oversight could further affect our ability to attract and retain our executive officers and other key personnel The loss of key personnel could materially adversely affect our business 25 Table of Contents Legal Regulatory and Compliance Risks Our business is subject to comprehensive government regulation and supervision which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition We are subject to comprehensive government regulation and supervision in jurisdictions around the world which significantly affects our business and requires continual enhancement of our compliance efforts Regulatory oversight and supervision of our businesses are generally designed to protect consumers and enhance financial stability and are not designed to protect our security holders Supervision efforts and the enforcement of existing laws and regulations impact the scope and profitability of our existing business activities limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities and adopt new technologies and affect our relationships with Card Members partners merchants vendors and other third parties New laws or regulations could similarly affect our business increase our costs of doing business and require us to change certain of our business practices and invest significant management attention and resources all of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition Legislators and regulators around the world are aware of each others approaches to the regulation of the payments industry Consequently a development in one country state or region may influence regulatory approaches in another To the extent that different regulatory systems impose overlapping or inconsistent requirements on the conduct of our business we face complexity and additional costs in our compliance efforts If we fail to satisfy regulatory requirements or maintain our financial holding company status our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected and we may be restricted in our ability to take certain capital actions such as declaring dividends or repurchasing outstanding shares or engage in certain business activities or acquisitions Additionally our banking regulators have wide discretion in the examination and the enforcement of applicable banking statutes and regulations and may restrict our ability to engage in certain business activities or acquisitions or require us to maintain more capital In recent years legislators and regulators have focused on the operation of card networks including interchange fees paid to card issuers in payment networks such as Visa and Mastercard and the fees merchants are charged to accept cards Even where we are not directly regulated regulation of bankcard fees significantly negatively impacts the discount revenue derived from our business including as a result of downward pressure on our discount rate from decreases in competitor pricing in connection with caps on interchange fees In some cases regulations also extend to certain aspects of our business such as network and cobrand arrangements or the terms of card acceptance for merchants including terms relating to nondiscrimination and honorallcards For example we have largely exited our network businesses in the EU and Australia as a result of regulation in those jurisdictions In addition there is uncertainty as to when or how interchange fee caps and other provisions of the EU payments legislation might apply when we work with cobrand partners and agents in the EU In a ruling issued on February 7 2018 the EU Court of Justice confirmed the validity of the application of the fee caps and other provisions in circumstances where threeparty networks issue cards with a cobrand partner or through an agent although the ruling provided only limited guidance as to when or how the provisions might apply in such circumstances and remains subject to differing interpretations by regulators and participants in cobrand arrangements As a result there can be no assurance we will be able to maintain our existing cobrand and agent relationships in the EU Furthermore the European Commission is in the process of conducting an impact assessment of the interchange fee caps which could potentially result in lower andor additional interchange fee caps and restrictions We are subject to certain provisions of the Bank Secrecy Act as amended by the Patriot Act with regard to maintaining effective AML programs Similar AML requirements apply under the laws of most jurisdictions where we operate Increased regulatory focus in this area is likely to result in increased costs related to oversight supervision and fines and may result in changes to our business practices including restrictions with respect to the types of products and services we may offer to consumers the countries in which our cards may be used and the types of customers and merchants who can obtain or accept our cards Emerging technologies such as digital currencies could limit our ability to track the movement of funds Money laundering terrorist financing and other illicit activities involving our business could result in enforcement action and our reputation may suffer due to our customers association with certain countries persons or entities or the existence of any such transactions Various regulatory agencies and legislatures are also considering regulations and legislation covering identity theft account management guidelines credit bureau reporting disclosure rules security and marketing that would impact us directly in part due to increased scrutiny of our underwriting and account management standards These new requirements may restrict our ability to issue charge and credit cards or partner with other financial institutions which could adversely affect our revenue growth See Supervision and Regulation for more information about certain laws and regulations to which we are subject and their impact on us 26 Table of Contents Litigation and regulatory actions could subject us to significant fines penalties judgments andor requirements resulting in significantly increased expenses damage to our reputation andor a material adverse effect on our business Businesses in the financial services and payments industries have historically been subject to significant legal actions including class action lawsuits Many of these actions have included claims for substantial compensatory or punitive damages While we have historically relied on our arbitration clause in agreements with customers to limit our exposure to class action litigation there can be no assurance that we will continue to be successful in enforcing our arbitration clause in the future and claims of the type we previously arbitrated could be subject to the complexities risks and costs associated with class action cases The continued focus of merchants on issues relating to the acceptance of various forms of payment may lead to additional litigation and other legal actions Given the inherent uncertainties involved in litigation and the very large or indeterminate damages sought in some matters asserted against us there is significant uncertainty as to the ultimate liability we may incur from litigation matters We have been subject to regulatory actions and may continue to be subject to such actions including governmental inquiries investigations and enforcement proceedings in the event of noncompliance or alleged noncompliance with laws or regulations For example we have been cooperating with certain governmental authorities that have requested information from or served subpoenas on us seeking information relating to a small specialized part of our business known as foreign exchange international payments FXIP which offers crossborder payments services primarily to small and middle market business customers in five countries including the United States In particular we received investigative subpoenas from both the civil and criminal divisions of the US Department of Justice as well as inquiries from the Federal Reserve the OCC the CFPB the FDIC and others FXIP accounts for less than one half of one percent of our total revenue net of interest expense and is unrelated to our card businesses Relatedly our review of FXIPs pricing practices conducted with an outside law firm has concluded and as a result we voluntarily provided approximately 15 million of remediation to certain customers covering a fiveyear period and took disciplinary action where appropriate We do not believe this matter will have a material adverse impact on our operations or results We expect that regulators will continue taking formal enforcement actions against financial institutions in addition to addressing supervisory concerns through nonpublic supervisory actions or findings which could involve restrictions on our activities among other limitations that could adversely affect our business In addition a violation of law or regulation by another financial institution could give rise to an investigation by regulators and other governmental agencies of the same or similar practices by us Further a single event may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and proceedings Regulatory action could subject us to significant fines penalties or other requirements resulting in Card Member reimbursements increased expenses limitations or conditions on our business activities and damage to our reputation and our brand which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition Legal proceedings regarding provisions in our merchant contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business and result in additional litigation andor arbitrations substantial monetary damages and damage to our reputation and brand We are and have been in the past a defendant in a number of actions including legal proceedings and proposed class actions filed by merchants challenging certain provisions of our card acceptance agreements A description of the outstanding legal proceedings is contained in Legal Proceedings An adverse outcome in these proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations require us to change our merchant agreements in a way that could expose our cards to increased merchant steering and other forms of discrimination that could impair the Card Member experience result in additional litigation andor arbitrations impose substantial monetary damages and damage our reputation and brand Even if we were not required to change our merchant agreements changes in Visas and Mastercards policies or practices as a result of legal proceedings lawsuit settlements or regulatory actions pending against them could result in changes to our business practices and materially and adversely impact our profitability We are subject to capital adequacy and liquidity rules and if we fail to meet these rules our business would be materially adversely affected Failure to meet current or future capital or liquidity requirements could compromise our competitive position and could result in restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve including limiting our ability to pay dividends repurchase our capital stock invest in our business expand our business or engage in acquisitions 27 Table of Contents Some elements of the capital and liquidity regimes are not yet final and certain developments could significantly impact the requirements applicable to financial institutions For example the Basel Committee finalized revisions to the standardized approach for credit risk and operational risk capital requirements If these revisions are adopted in the United States we could be required to hold significantly more capital As a result the ultimate impact on our longterm capital and liquidity planning and our results of operations is not certain although an increase in our capital and liquid asset levels could lower our return on equity As part of our required stress testing we must continue to comply with applicable capital standards as calculated under the standardized approach in the severely adverse economic scenario published by the Federal Reserve To satisfy these requirements it may be necessary for us to hold additional capital in excess of that required by the Capital Rules Compliance with capital adequacy and liquidity rules requires a material investment of resources An inability to meet regulatory expectations regarding our compliance with applicable capital adequacy and liquidity rules may also negatively impact the assessment of us and our US bank subsidiary by federal banking regulators For more information on capital adequacy requirements see Stress Testing and Capital Planning and Capital Leverage and Liquidity Regulation under Supervision and Regulation We are subject to restrictions that limit our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our capital stock Our subsidiaries are also subject to restrictions that limit their ability to pay dividends to us which may adversely affect our liquidity We are limited in our ability to pay dividends and repurchase capital stock by our regulators who have broad authority to prohibit any action that would be considered an unsafe or unsound banking practice For example we are subject to a requirement to submit capital plans that include among other things projected dividend payments and repurchases of capital stock to the Federal Reserve for review As part of the capital planning and stress testing process our proposed capital actions are assessed against our ability to satisfy applicable capital requirements in the event of a stressed market environment If the Federal Reserve objects to our capital plan or if we fail to satisfy applicable capital requirements our ability to undertake capital actions may be restricted In addition the Capital Rules include buffers that can be satisfied only with CET1 capital If our riskbased capital ratios were to fall below the applicable buffer levels we would be subject to certain restrictions on dividends stock repurchases and other capital distributions as well as discretionary bonus payments to executive officers Our ability to declare or pay dividends on or to purchase redeem or otherwise acquire shares of our common stock will be prohibited subject to certain exceptions in the event that we do not declare and pay in full dividends for the last preceding dividend period of our Series B and Series C preferred stock American Express Company relies on dividends from its subsidiaries for liquidity and federal and state laws regulations and supervisory policy limit the amount of dividends that our subsidiaries may pay to the parent company For example our US bank subsidiary AENB is subject to various statutory and regulatory limitations on its declaration and payment of dividends These limitations may hinder our ability to access funds we may need to make payments on our obligations make dividend payments on outstanding American Express Company capital stock or otherwise achieve strategic objectives Any reduction of or elimination of our common stock dividend or share repurchase program would likely adversely affect the market price of our common stock and market perceptions of American Express For more information on bank holding company and depository institution dividend restrictions see Dividends and Other Capital Distributions under Supervision and Regulation as well as Consolidated Capital Resources and LiquidityShare Repurchases and Dividends under MDA and Note 22 to our Consolidated Financial Statements Regulation in the areas of privacy data protection account access and information and cyber security could increase our costs and affect or limit our business opportunities and how we collect andor use personal information Legislators and regulators in the United States and other countries in which we operate are increasingly adopting or revising privacy data protection and information and cyber security laws including data localization authentication and account access laws As such laws are interpreted and applied in some cases with significant differences or conflicting requirements across jurisdictions compliance and technology costs will continue to increase particularly in the context of ensuring that adequate data protection data transfer and account access mechanisms are in place Compliance with current or future privacy data protection account access and information and cyber security laws could significantly impact our collection use sharing retention and safeguarding of consumer andor colleague information and could restrict our ability to fully maximize our closedloop capability or provide certain products and services which could materially and adversely affect our profitability 28 Table of Contents Our failure to comply with privacy data protection account access and information and cyber security laws could result in potentially significant regulatory andor governmental investigations andor actions litigation fines sanctions ongoing regulatory monitoring customer attrition decreases in the use or acceptance of our cards and damage to our reputation and our brand In recent years there has been increasing regulatory enforcement and litigation activity in the areas of privacy data protection and information and cyber security in the United States the EU and various other countries in which we operate For more information on regulatory and legislative activity in this area see Privacy Data Protection Information and Cyber Security under Supervision and Regulation We may not be able to effectively manage the operational conduct and compliance risks to which we are exposed We consider operational risk to be the risk of not achieving business objectives due to inadequate or failed processes or information systems poor data quality human error or the external environment eg natural disasters Operational risk includes among others the risk that error or misconduct could result in a material financial misstatement a failure to monitor a third partys compliance with regulatory or legal requirements or a failure to adequately monitor and control access to or use of data in our systems we grant to thirdparties As processes or organizations are changed or new products and services are introduced we may not fully appreciate or identify new operational risks that may arise from such changes Through human error fraud or malfeasance conduct risk can result in harm to customers broader markets and the company and its employees Compliance risk arises from the failure to adhere to applicable laws rules regulations and internal policies and procedures Operational conduct and compliance risks can expose us to reputational and legal risks as well as fines civil money penalties or payment of damages and can lead to diminished business opportunities and diminished ability to expand key operations If we are not able to protect our intellectual property or successfully defend against any infringement or misappropriation assertions brought against us our revenue and profitability could be negatively affected We rely on a variety of measures to protect our intellectual property and control access to and distribution of our trade secrets and other proprietary information These measures may not prevent infringement of our intellectual property rights or misappropriation of our proprietary information and a resulting loss of competitive advantage The ability to enforce intellectual property rights to prevent disclosure of our trade secrets and other proprietary information may be limited in certain jurisdictions In addition competitors or other third parties may allege that our systems processes or technologies infringe on their intellectual property rights Given the complex rapidly changing and competitive technological and business environments in which we operate and the potential risks and uncertainties of intellectual propertyrelated litigation a future assertion of an infringement or misappropriation claim against us could cause us to lose significant revenues incur significant defense license royalty or technology development expenses andor pay significant monetary damages Tax legislative initiatives or assessments by governmental authorities could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition We are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and in various foreign jurisdictions The laws and regulations related to tax matters are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations Although management believes our positions are reasonable we are subject to audit by the Internal Revenue Service in the United States and by tax authorities in all the jurisdictions in which we conduct business operations We are being challenged in a number of countries regarding our application of valueadded taxes VAT to certain transactions While we believe we comply with all applicable VAT and other tax laws rules and regulations in the relevant jurisdictions the tax authorities may determine that we owe additional taxes or apply existing laws and regulations more broadly which could result in a significant increase in liabilities for taxes and interest in excess of accrued liabilities New tax legislative initiatives may be proposed from time to time which may impact our effective tax rate and could adversely affect our tax positions or tax liabilities New guidance or modifications to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 the Tax Act could have an adverse effect on our results of operations In addition unilateral or multijurisdictional actions by various tax authorities including an increase in tax audit activity could have an adverse impact on our tax liabilities 29 Table of Contents Credit Liquidity and Market Risks Our risk management policies and procedures may not be effective Our risk management framework seeks to identify and mitigate risk and appropriately balance risk and return We have established policies and procedures intended to identify monitor and manage the types of risk to which we are subject including credit risk market risk asset liability risk liquidity risk operational risk compliance risk model risk strategic and business risk and reputational risk See Risk Management under MDA for a discussion of the policies and procedures we use to identify monitor and manage the risks we assume in conducting our businesses Although we have devoted significant resources to develop our risk management policies and procedures and expect to continue to do so in the future these policies and procedures as well as our risk management techniques such as our hedging strategies may not be fully effective There may also be risks that exist or develop in the future that we have not appropriately anticipated identified or mitigated As regulations and markets in which we operate continue to evolve our risk management framework may not always keep sufficient pace with those changes If our risk management framework does not effectively identify or mitigate our risks we could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected Management of our risks in some cases depends upon the use of analytical andor forecasting models Although we have a governance framework for model development and independent model validation the modeling methodology or key assumptions could be erroneous or the models could be misused In addition issues with the quality or effectiveness of our data aggregation and validation procedures as well as the quality and integrity of data inputs could result in ineffective or inaccurate model outputs and reports For example models based on historical data sets might not be accurate predictors of future outcomes and their ability to appropriately predict future outcomes may degrade over time Upon the adoption of the new accounting guidance for the recognition of credit losses on certain financial instruments effective January 1 2020 we began using a new credit reserve methodology which requires measurement of expected credit losses for the estimated life of the financial instrument not only based on historical experience and current conditions but also by including forecasts incorporating forwardlooking information If our business decisions or estimates for credit losses are based on incorrect or misused models and assumptions or we fail to manage data inputs effectively and to aggregate or analyze data in an accurate and timely manner our results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected We may not be able to effectively manage individual or institutional credit risk or credit trends that can affect spending on card products and the ability of customers and partners to pay us which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition We are exposed to both individual credit risk principally from consumer and small business Card Member loans and receivables and institutional credit risk principally from corporate Card Member loans and receivables merchants network partners loyalty coalition partners and treasury and investment counterparties Third parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons General economic factors such as the rate of inflation unemployment levels and interest rates may result in greater delinquencies that lead to greater credit losses Country regional and political risks can also contribute to credit risk A customers ability and willingness to repay us can be negatively impacted not only by economic market political and social conditions but by a customers other payment obligations and increasing leverage can result in a higher risk that customers will default or become delinquent in their obligations to us We rely principally on the customers creditworthiness for repayment of the loan or receivable and therefore have no other recourse for collection Our ability to assess creditworthiness may be impaired if the criteria or models we use to manage our credit risk prove inaccurate in predicting future losses which could cause our losses to rise and have a negative impact on our results of operations Further our pricing strategies may not offset the negative impact on profitability caused by increases in delinquencies and losses thus any material increases in delinquencies and losses beyond our current estimates could have a material adverse impact on us Rising delinquencies and rising rates of bankruptcy are often precursors of future writeoffs and may require us to increase our reserve for loan losses Higher writeoff rates and the resulting increase in our reserves for loan and receivable losses adversely affect our profitability and the performance of our securitizations and may increase our cost of funds Although we make estimates to provide for credit losses in our outstanding portfolio of loans and receivables these estimates may not be accurate In addition the information we use in managing our credit risk may be inaccurate or incomplete As noted above we began using a new credit reserve methodology effective January 1 2020 which differs significantly from our previous approach and alters the estimation process inputs and assumptions used in estimating expected credit losses for loans and receivables The new methodology may have a significant effect on our reported results and could cause fluctuations in our reported results even if there are no underlying changes in the economics of the business For more information on recently issued accounting standards see Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements 30 Table of Contents Although we regularly review our credit exposure to specific clients and counterparties and to specific industries countries and regions that we believe may present credit concerns default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to foresee or detect such as fraud In addition our ability to manage credit risk may be adversely affected by legal or regulatory changes such as restrictions on collections or changes in bankruptcy laws minimum payment regulations and reage guidance Increased credit risk whether resulting from underestimating the credit losses inherent in our portfolio of loans and receivables deteriorating economic conditions particularly in the United States where approximately 75 percent of our revenues were generated in 2019 increases in the level of loan balances changes in our mix of business or otherwise could require us to increase our provisions for losses and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition Interest rate increases could materially adversely affect our earnings If the rate of interest we pay on our borrowings increases more than the rate of interest we earn on our loans our net interest yield and consequently our net interest income could fall Our interest expense was approximately 35 billion for the year ended December 31 2019 A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would have resulted in a decrease to our annual net interest income of approximately 141 million as of December 31 2019 We expect the rates we pay on our deposits will increase if benchmark interest rates increase In addition interest rate changes may affect customer behavior such as impacting the loan balances Card Members carry on their credit cards or their ability to make payments as higher interest rates lead to higher payment requirements further impacting our results of operations For a further discussion of our interest rate risk see Risk Management  Market Risk Management Process under MDA Uncertainty relating to LIBOR and other reference rates and their potential discontinuance may negatively impact our access to funding and the value of our financial instruments and commercial agreements Due to uncertainty surrounding the suitability and sustainability of the London interbank offered rate LIBOR central banks and global regulators have called for financial market participants to prepare for the discontinuance of LIBOR by the end of 2021 and the establishment of alternative reference rates At this time it is not possible to predict the effect that any discontinuance modification or other reforms to LIBOR or any other reference rate the establishment of alternative reference rates or the impact of any such events on contractual mechanisms may have on the markets us or our financial instruments or commercial agreements that reference LIBOR Certain of our financial instruments and commercial agreements contain provisions to replace LIBOR as the benchmark following the occurrence of specified transition events Such provisions may not be sufficient to trigger a change in the benchmark at all times when LIBOR is no longer representative of market interest rates or that these events will align with similar events in the market generally or in other parts of the financial markets such as the derivatives market Alternative reference rates are calculated using components different from those used in the calculation of LIBOR and may fluctuate differently than and not be representative of LIBOR In order to compensate for these differences certain of our financial instruments and commercial agreements allow for a benchmark replacement adjustment However there is no assurance that any benchmark replacement adjustment will be sufficient to produce the economic equivalent of LIBOR either at the benchmark replacement date or over the life of such instruments and agreements Uncertainty as to the nature and timing of the potential discontinuance or modification of LIBOR the replacement of LIBOR with one or more alternative reference rates or other reforms may negatively impact market liquidity our access to funding required to operate our business and the trading market for our financial instruments Furthermore the timing of implementation and use of alternative reference rates and corresponding adjustments or other reforms could be subject to disputes could cause the interest payable on our outstanding financial instruments and commercial agreements to be materially different than expected and may impact the value of our financial instruments and commercial agreements For a further discussion on LIBOR Transition see Risk Management  LIBOR Transition under MDA Adverse financial market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs access to capital and cost of capital We need liquidity to pay merchants operating and other expenses interest on debt and dividends on capital stock and to repay maturing liabilities The principal sources of our liquidity are payments from Card Members proceeds from the issuance of unsecured medium and longterm notes and asset securitizations and direct and thirdparty sourced deposits cash flows from our investment portfolio cash and cash equivalents securitized borrowings through our secured borrowing facilities a committed bank credit facility and the Federal Reserve discount window Our ability to obtain financing in the debt capital markets for unsecured term debt and asset securitizations is dependent on market conditions Disruptions uncertainty or volatility across the financial markets as well as adverse developments affecting our competitors and the financial industry generally could negatively impact market liquidity and limit our access to funding required to operate our business Such market conditions may also limit our ability to replace in a timely manner maturing 31 Table of Contents liabilities satisfy regulatory capital requirements and access the funding necessary to grow our business In some circumstances we may incur an unattractive cost to raise capital which could decrease profitability and significantly reduce financial flexibility For a further discussion of our liquidity and funding needs see Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity  Funding Programs and Activities under MDA Any reduction in our and our subsidiaries credit ratings could increase the cost of our funding from and restrict our access to the capital markets and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition Rating agencies regularly evaluate us and our subsidiaries and their ratings of our and our subsidiaries longterm and shortterm debt and deposits are based on a number of factors including financial strength as well as factors not within our control including conditions affecting the financial services industry generally and the wider state of the economy Our and our subsidiaries ratings could be downgraded at any time and without any notice by any of the rating agencies which could among other things adversely limit our access to the capital markets and adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we and our subsidiaries are able to obtain funding Adverse currency fluctuations and foreign exchange controls could decrease earnings we receive from our international operations and impact our capital During 2019 approximately 25 percent of our total revenues net of interest expense were generated from activities outside the United States We are exposed to foreign exchange risk from our international operations and accordingly the revenue we generate outside the United States is subject to unpredictable fluctuations if the values of other currencies change relative to the US dollar including as a result of Brexit which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations Foreign exchange regulations or capital controls might restrict or prohibit the conversion of other currencies into US dollars or our ability to transfer them Political and economic conditions in other countries could also impact the availability of foreign exchange for the payment by the local card issuer of obligations arising out of local Card Members spending outside such country and for the payment by Card Members who are billed in a currency other than their local currency Substantial and sudden devaluation of local Card Members currency can also affect their ability to make payments to the local issuer of the card in connection with spending outside the local country The occurrence of any of these circumstances could further impact our results of operations An inability to accept or maintain deposits due to market demand or regulatory constraints could materially adversely affect our liquidity position and our ability to fund our business Our US bank subsidiary AENB accepts deposits directly from consumers through American Express Personal Savings as well as from individuals through thirdparty brokerage networks and uses the proceeds as a source of funding As of December 31 2019 we had approximately 724 billion in total US retail deposits of which a significant amount had been raised through thirdparty brokerage networks We face strong and increasing competition with regard to deposits and pricing and product changes may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain costeffective deposit balances If we are required to offer higher interest rates to attract or maintain deposits our funding costs will be adversely impacted Our ability to obtain deposit funding and offer competitive interest rates on deposits is also dependent on AENBs capital levels The FDIAs brokered deposit provisions and related FDIC rules in certain circumstances prohibit banks from accepting or renewing brokered deposits and apply other restrictions such as a cap on interest rates that can be paid Additionally our regulators can adjust applicable capital requirements at any time and have authority to place limitations on our deposit businesses An inability to attract or maintain deposits in the future could materially adversely affect our ability to fund our business The value of our investments may be adversely impacted by economic political or market conditions Market risk includes the loss in value of portfolios and financial instruments due to adverse changes in market variables which could negatively impact our financial condition We held approximately 84 billion of investment securities as of December 31 2019 In the event that actual default rates of these investment securities were to significantly change from historical patterns due to economic conditions or otherwise it could have a material adverse impact on the value of our investment portfolio potentially resulting in impairment charges Defaults or economic disruptions even in countries or territories in which we do not have material investment exposure conduct business or have operations could adversely affect us 32 Table of Contents ITEM 1B UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS Not applicable ITEM 2 PROPERTIES Our principal executive offices are in a 22 million square foot building located in
